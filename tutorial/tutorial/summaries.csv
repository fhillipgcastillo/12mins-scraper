Leadershift Summary,https://blog.12min.com/leadershift-pdf-summary-2/,https://blog.12min.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image1-1.jpg,"14 min read ⌚ 
In the “slow” world of yesterday, being a leader is not unlike being a captain of a ship: you need to maintain course, plan ahead and manage the crew.
In the “fast” world of today, however, being a leader is much more like being a cheetah: you need to be fast, nimble, flexible, able to constantly adapt.
According to John C. Maxwell, we’re living through a paradigm shift, one that has redefined the very meaning of the word “leadership.” So we might as well change the word:
. 
Who Should Read “Leadershift”? And Why?
There are not many leadership authors that write as clearly and as vividly as John C. Maxwell. 
So, even though he is not the first to talk about leadershifting (just recently, we summarized one of the pioneering books on the subject of 
, 
), we guess that this is the book that will become the classical introduction to the topic.
Suitable for both experienced and would-be leaders, we recommend 
warmly and wholeheartedly to anyone who wants to understand how leaders ought to think about in the most dynamic age in history.
About John C. Maxwell

“Leadershift PDF Summary”
“You cannot be the same, think the same and act the same if you hope to be successful in a world that does not remain the same,” writes 
 early in 
, clearly outlining the main premise of his book.
In the 1970s, when he was young and new to his career, as he says, there were very few books on leadership, because “
ruled the business world and Peter Drucker was the king.” But toward the 1980s that changed and people started to write and buy leadership books. For a very obvious reason: life started moving faster, change was becoming normal, and managers needed to find a more flexible way to organize their companies.
“As fast as the pace was in the 1980s,” goes on Maxwell, “when I look back it seems slow by today’s standards. Life moves 
faster now. The rate at which we must deal with change and uncertainty can seem insane.”
The problem is that leaders, by the very definition of their role, have to stay ahead and see 
 than everyone else—way before everyone else can see it. The second guy to finish a race is, as they say, the first loser and, even though in sports the achievements of the two guys behind the leader are also recognized, in business (as in life), it is the winner that takes it all.
In addition to moving faster, life is also constantly evolving, making the race far less predictable. Or as Maxwell says, nowadays, 
 is shorter. You see, up until 30 years ago, a short-range plan of two years, a medium-range plan of five years, and a long-range plan of ten years were the hallmarks of leading a successful organization. Now, even long-range plans of two years seem absurd!
In short, business was once a marathon and, in a marathon, managing your strength and pace while being consistent in your tempo is what eventually gets you the victory. It’s a long race and you can be sure that the finish line won’t move for a long period of time. Today, however, business is a relentless series of sprints, and in sprints, you need to be incredibly fast and agile and flexible—like a cheetah.
How does a leader do more than just hang on and survive in this kind of an ever-changing, fast-moving environment? “The key,” says Maxwell, “is to learn how to continually make 
.” Needless to say, that’s what 
 is all about.
The Top 3 Leadership Qualities of the Future (and the Essence of Leadershifting)
In one of her books, educator and author Bruna Martinuzzi cited a recent study conducted by an organization called the Economic Intelligence Unit. The study, via a survey, identified the top three leadership qualities that will be important in the years ahead:
• the ability to motivate staff (35%)
• the ability to work well across cultures (34%)
• the ability to facilitate change (32%)
All of these qualities require adaptability, an ability which, in Maxwell’s opinion, has rarely been more important in history than it is today. 
His opinion can be confirmed not only by common sense but also by a study conducted by Right Management and published recently in 
 that made it clear that adaptability is all the rage nowadays. In numbers, the study uncovered that “91% of future recruiting in the workplace will be based on people’s ability to deal with change and uncertainty.” Leaders are not exempt: on the contrary, in fact, they need to be even more adaptable than their employees.
And that’s what 
 entails: it is not anymore about having a predefined course and being a captain of a ship (leadership), but about being able to (to paraphrase Bob Dylan) change your horses in midstream.
“Good leaders adapt,” writes Maxwell. “They shift. They don’t remain static because they know the world around them does not remain static. This has always been true, but it’s never more obvious than today, nor has the ability to change quickly been more important.”
As defined by John C. Maxwell, “leadershifting is the ability and willingness to make a leadership change that will positively enhance organizational and personal growth.” Or, even more concise, as defined in the blurb, leadershift is “the act of nimbly adapting one’s leadership in the midst of rapid change.” 
This can be achieved via 7 fundamental practices, 4 self-improvement techniques, and 11 essential changes.
The 7 Fundamental Leadershift Practices
If you want to become tomorrow’s leader, you need to embrace 7 principles, seven leadershift practices that should help you face every possible situation with both confidence and flexibility:
. “The lessons learned in school can become outdated before student loans are paid off,” 
The encyclopedias of the past were updated once every few years; today’s encyclopedias are updated several times a minute. Update yourself: constantly.
. “Yesterday’s homerun doesn’t win today’s game,” said once baseball’s greatest Babe Ruth. The lesson: focus on current challenges, and leave the past glories to the past.
As
Wild West’s gunslingers knew full well, it’s not only about being fast but also about being fast at the right time. As then, timing is everything today as well.
Try to
learn in layers. And never fool yourself that you’ve learned everything there is to know about a subject. It’s quite the opposite: the more you learn about something—if you’re learning correctly—the 
 there is to learn.
Even though, as we said above (#2), you need to focus on today, leaders are leaders because they can think about tomorrow as well. Even if for much, much shorter periods than in the 1980s—always, 
, plan ahead.
Being a leader is all about risking, about getting out of the comfort zone. It’s not only true that when the going gets tough, the tough get going—it’s also true that the ones who risk bravely are the ones who win the biggest prizes.
Upgrading, upgrading, upgrading. In a world of radical changes, that is your only way to remain a leader in the long run. Only the short-sighted rest on their laurels.
The 4 Questions You Need to Ask Yourself
As we said above, if you want to prepare yourself to become someone who 
—rather than being someone who merely leads—you need to improve constantly. 
By asking yourself the following four questions, you should be able to set signposts to guide you on your journey toward self-improvement, which, in essence, can be described in, more or less, a version of the famous Olympic motto: faster, higher, stronger:
.
Ask yourself, “When’s the last time I learned something for the first time?”
.
Ask yourself, “When’s the last time I did something for the first time?”
Ask yourself, “When’s the last time I found something better for the first time?”
Ask yourself, “When’s the last time I saw something bigger for the first time?”
The 11 Essential Changes Every Leader Must Embrace
Now that we’ve tucked the matter under the bed—if you want to be a leader in the 21
 century, you need to change constantly—it’s time we go over the eleven essential changes every leader must embrace, i.e., the leadershifts from the title.
Thirty years ago, being a leader was all about being a soloist, being the one who can do everything on his own and doesn’t need a backing orchestra. In the world of today, however, leadership is much more akin to being a conductor: the one who directs everyone in the right direction so that the symphony is harmonious. As 
 wrote once, “You can get everything in life you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want.” 
“Goals helped me 
 better,” writes Maxwell, “but growth helped me 
 better.” Needless to add, in the 21
 century, you need to redeploy your attention and interest toward the latter: as important as goals are, growth should come before them. The four areas you need to focus the most are the following: attitude, leadership skills, developing strong relationships, and equipping others to carry on without you. 
“There is no success without sacrifice,” said once Adoniram Judson, the first Protestant missionary sent from North America to preach in Burma. “If you succeed without sacrifice, it is because someone has suffered before you. If you sacrifice without success, it is because someone will succeed after you.” Great leaders prefer the leader: they don’t become leaders because they want to get something, but because they know they can 
 something. “What sets great leaders apart from all other leaders is this,” writes Maxwell. “They 
 before others, and they 
 more than others. Great leaders face their uncertainty and doubt, and they move through it to pave the way for others.”
“The leadership business” is 
 “the friendship business.” If you want to lead other people, you need to do away with the need to be liked by them: leadership, by definition, means challenging others to go beyond their comfort zone, and people don’t like to be uncomfortable. Think of it this way: if you lead them right, they might not like you today or tomorrow, but they’ll love you in twenty years.
Whether we want it or not, most of the time, we do things convention says we should do. After all, tradition is tested knowledge, and if it has worked for millions of times in the past, it should work today as well, right? Well, wrong: in a fast-changing world, maintaining best practices should be balanced with creating, and leaders should teach their employees to stop thinking in terms of “I do what I have always done” and start accepting as a motto the “creative zone” adage: “I attempt to think what I have never thought before.”
“How high can I go?” was the question of the ladder-climbers of the greedy 80s. Then, after that world crumbled to pieces, it evolved to something a bit more human as “How high will others go with a little help?” These ladder-holders recently became ladder-extenders, and started positing themselves the question: “how high will others go with a lot of help?” We need to make the final step, suggests Maxwell, and become ladder-builders. The new question leaders should adapt as an objective is: “Can I help 
 build their own ladder?”
“When you interact with others as a leader, what is your mindset?” asks Maxwell. “Is your intention to correct them or connect with them?” If the former, then you are a dinosaur, one of all those Moses Juniors of the past who believed that leaders should be all about “I know and order, you don’t and listen.” The leaders of tomorrow are the leaders who connect today: they are trustful and talkative, they listen, they ask questions, they have answers. Become one of them, 
.
Diversity, according to Malcolm Forbes, is “the art of thinking independently together.” And it is the hallmark of a great leader. Examples: during the American Civil War, Abraham Lincoln gathered around him 
, because he knew that 
he would get the best advice; similarly, during the Second World War, Winston Churchill often debated with Clement Attlee, one of his fiercest political adversaries. Don’t back away from dissent: embrace it.
21
 century is the age of what Alexander Havard deems 
. Gone are the days when the mere position of leader granted one authority: workers are nowadays more inclined to leave their jobs if their leaders are not morally authoritative as well. So, strive for moral authority, “the recognition of a person’s leadership influence based on who they are more than the position they hold.”
This is perhaps the most important leadershift of the eleven, the one that “will bring the greatest change to your life and the lives of those around you.” Unlike trained leaders who both act and teach following by-the-book guidelines, transformational leaders encourage and inspire people around them to become more through their very existence. So, don’t forget that Gandhian adage, paraphrased by Maxwell thus: “If you want to see positive changes in your world, the first person you must change is you. As leaders, you and I have to be changed to bring change. We teach what we know, but we reproduce who we are.”
There are three kinds of people in the world: 1) those who merely do a job, 2) those who want to have a career; and 3) those who have a calling. Great leaders can only be born out of those in the third category. So, it’s not about becoming a leader just because you want to emulate your idols: it’s because you can’t be anything else and your skillset is suitable for the job. It’s like Aristotle said: “Where our talents and the needs of the world cross, there lies our vocation.” So, by definition, your calling is never merely about you, but about the whole world as well: “a calling moves us from the center of everything in our world to becoming the channel through which good things come to others.”

3.      The 11 Leadershifts Every Leader Should Make
From Leadership to Leadershift: the World Is Changing, and You Need to Adapt
Everything is changing so fast nowadays, that the only ones able to keep up with the pace are the flexible ones.
Adaptability is, by far, the most important trait a modern leader should possess. It is so important, in fact, that leadership can be better defined as leadershift nowadays—something that requires constant adjustments and change.
As Maxwell writes, today, “every advance you make as a leader will require a Leadershift that changes the way you think, act, and lead.”
The 7 Fundamental Leadership Practices
With the above in mind, these are the 7 fundamental leadership practices of the 21
 century:
#1. Continually learn, unlearn and relearn. 
#2. Value yesterday but live in today. 
#3. Rely on speed but thrive on timing. 
#4. See the big picture as the picture keeps getting bigger.
#5. Live in today, but think about tomorrow. 
#6. Move forward courageously in the midst of uncertainty.
#7. Realize today’s best will not meet tomorrow’s challenges. 
The 11 Leadershifts Every Leader Should Make
Even more important than the leadership practices above are the eleven leadershifts, dubbed by Maxwell as the “essential changes every leader must embrace.” They are:
. Great leaders are never soloists: they orchestrate.
 Goals are great, but growth is better. Be growth-oriented.
 Great leaders don’t think about what they can get out of their position: they are focused on what they can give.
 Stop worrying about pleasing people: start challenging them.
 Tradition doesn’t work as well as it used to: instead of maintaining the old ways, focus on creating new rituals.
 Become an equipper: build ladders for your employees, and not for yourself (in fact, the latter will happen simultaneously).
 Stop ordering people around: connect with them.
 Bring to your team people who are different than you, even such that don’t agree with your strategies: dissent breeds progress.
 You’re not a leader because of your position, but because of your character. Never forget that.
 Don’t settle with being a trained leader: become a transformational one who inspires and encourages other people to become more than they are.
 Becoming a leader should never be a career move: great leaders are the ones who have a calling to become that.

Our Critical Review
Until about a decade ago, whenever John C. Maxwell published a new book—and that occurred quite often—it was such an event that the first edition was sometimes be sold out before the book had actually hit the shelves. 
However, since Maxwell started being a bit repetitive (he is too prolific to not be), that changed a bit recently. Fortunately, 
is as fresh and as insightful as his best and most renowned books. And that means it is as fresh and as insightful as any leadership (or leadershift) book on the market.
Buy it, read it, reread it, go back to it constantly. Maxwell has done it again."

Do you want to hear all about the last major expedition of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration?
Then look no further: Alfred Lansing’s classic 
is its best and most spellbinding account.
And we have the summary!
Who Should Read “Endurance”? And Why?
If you are interested in the history of exploration – and especially the exploration of the Antarctic region during the first quarter of the 20
 century – then 
is one of the classic books on the subject. 
Hundred years after the original expedition, Shackleton’s endeavor is even more interesting to people who investigate the traits and essence of great leadership. See why. 
Alfred Lansing Biography
 was an American journalist and writer, best known for his 1957 classic, 
Born in Chicago on July 21, 1921, Lansing served the U.S. Navy during the Second World War and received a Purple Heart for being wounded during his service. Afterward, he enrolled at North Park College and later at Northwestern University, where he majored in journalism.
He edited a weekly newspaper between 1946 and 1949, before joining the United Press and becoming a freelance writer in 1952.
With Walter Modell, Lansing co-authored one of the last books from the Life Science Library, 
(1967). Just eight years later, he died, aged 54.
Plot
First discovered by a Russian expedition in 1820, the continent of Antarctica became an object of fascination for numerous explorers around the world during the last years of the 19
 century and the first two decades of the 20
 century. To history buffs and readers of exploration literature, this period is mostly known as the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration.
For a reason: during the Heroic Age, no less than 17 major Antarctic expeditions were launched from 10 different countries of the world. Though some of them had scientific interests, the primary object of most of these expeditions was, interestingly, to become the first expedition to reach the geographic South Pole.
That happened in December 1911, when 
 Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen decisively beat the (ironically) better-remembered one led by a British Royal Navy Officer named Robert Falcon Scott.
However,
Alfred Lansing’s Heroic Age classic, 
is not about Robert Falcon Scott—a celebrated hero of his day and age, but also someone whose leadership qualities and competence of character have been questioned in recent times—but about one of his officers during previous journeys, Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton.
And it’s not about merely reaching the South Pole, but about something even more daunting and unimaginable: crossing the entire continent from sea to sea, via the pole.
Why would someone set before himself such a goal? Well, maybe it’s best if we dedicate the first two sections of our summary to answering this question.
The Protagonist: Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton
Born on February 15, 1874, in Ireland, 
 is now widely considered one of the principal figures of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration.
His first experience of the polar regions came relatively early: he was in his 20s when he was assigned the role of third officer on Captain Robert Falcon Scott’s landmark 
expedition of 1901–1904 that was organized by the British Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society with the objective of carrying out scientific research and geographical exploration of the untouched continent.
It was during this trip that he, Scott, and another companion set a new southern record (82°S), which Shackleton would better just a few years later during the 
expedition (88°S). However, when Amundsen reached the Farthest South latitude (90°S) on December 15, 1911, Shackleton was a bit shackled. 
It was almost as if he had nothing to accomplish anymore. But, restless and resolute as he was, just a few years later, he turned to the “one great object of Antarctic journeyings” remaining: transatlantic journey, i.e., crossing Antarctica from the Wendell Sea via the South Pole to McMurdo Sound.
Lansing describes Shackleton’s appearance in a vivid manner:
And then he adds something even more central about his character, something almost superhuman in an Ahab-or-
-kind-of-way: “Whatever his mood—whether it was gay and breezy, or dark with rage—he had one pervading characteristic: he was purposeful.”
The Objective and the Plan of the Expedition
The British didn’t take the news of the Norwegians reaching the South Pole before them lightly. Their record for exploration “had been perhaps unparalleled among the nations of the earth,” and now they had to take “a humiliating second-best” to a much less-renowned country.
Things took a turn for the worst when the news of Robert Falcon Scott’s tragic death reached England. The whole nation was saddened. In a way, Shackleton used this to his benefit while soliciting funds for his Trans-Antarctic expedition, playing “heavily on this matter of prestige, making it his primary argument for such an expedition.
“From the sentimental point of view,” he wrote once, “it is the last great Polar journey that can be made. It will be a greater journey than the journey to the Pole and back, and I feel it is up to the British nation to accomplish this, for we have been beaten at the conquest of the North Pole and beaten at the first conquest of the South Pole. There now remains the largest and most striking of all journeys—the crossing of the Continent.”
Shackleton’s plan—which owed a lot to an abandoned one penned by Scottish explorer, William Speirs Bruce—looked something like this:
Of course, not everybody was impressed: in some circles, this undertaking was criticized not only as being too “audacious,” but also being kind of “impossible.” Perhaps it had been both. But, as Lansing says, “if it hadn’t been audacious, it wouldn’t have been to Shackleton’s liking. He was, above all, an explorer in the classic mold—utterly self-reliant, romantic, and just a little swashbuckling.”
(By the way, if you have problems following Shackleton’s plan—and the rest of his journey—we sincerely advise you to 
: once again, Wikipedia’s contributors have provided the most intelligible map on the Internet).
The Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition
Ernest Shackleton’s 28-men expedition set sail on October 26, 1914, from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Nine days later, the ship (both prophetically and ironically—for reasons you’ll discover soon—named Endurance) reached the first stop of the journey: the Grytviken whaling station on South Georgia. Whalers there reported something portentous: the conditions in the Weddell Sea were the worst they could remember. 
Shackleton—for reasons explained above—barely even took this into consideration. A month later, on December 5, 1914, Endurance left South Georgia. Unfortunately, just two days later it encountered the first ice pack on their journey. Somehow, they managed to sail through it after about two weeks. The fact they drifted about 60 nautical miles from their intended target didn’t matter much: it was bearable.
But, very soon—in the middle of January 1915, to be exact—they happened upon another ice pack, some 200 miles from Vahsel Bay. This one they couldn’t get through: they got stuck immobile inside and had no choice but to leave Endurance drift away with the pack ice for the next several months. Eventually, they lost sight of land completely: in fact, due to the Weddell Sea current, they started circling back to South Georgia and they were further and further away not only from their target but also from any land whatsoever. 
To make matters worse, soon the Antarctic summer (which coincides with our winter) ended and the endless polar nights began. “In all the world there is no desolation more complete than the polar night,” writes Lansing. “It is a return to the Ice Age—no warmth, no life, no movement. Only those who have experienced it can fully appreciate what it means to be without the sun day after day and week after week. Few men unaccustomed to it can fight off its effects all together, and it has driven some men mad.”
To stop this from happening and neutralize the depression as much as possible, Shackleton organized Sunday evening gramophone concerts and monthly lectures by the Endurance’s photographers, among many other jolly events that helped the sailors keep their spirits up.
By late October 1915, still frozen immobile in the enormous ice pack, Endurance drifted over 500 nautical miles to the north-east. To make matters even worse, the ice had thickened in the meantime and Endurance had to endure much more pressure from the surrounding pack.
On October 27, 1915, it finally succumbed: the ice started crushing the boat. 
Immediately understanding the extent of this new misfortune, Shackleton had no choice but to order his crew to leave Endurance and start building a camp on a nearby floe of ice, while salvaging as much material and food as possible. 
During the next month or so, everything was stockpiled on the floe. On November 21, 1915, Endurance entirely sank beneath the sea.
Since the floe to which Shackleton’s crew had initially set a camp had also crumbled under pressure in the meantime, the crew had to relocate. Hoping that a new ice floe will drift them to safety, on December 29, Shackleton sets a new camp on another ice pack, and dubs him “The Patience Camp.”
The Patience Camp would be the crew’s home for the first third of 1916. While there, they would make a few attempts to sled over the ice, but all of them would prove to be unsuccessful. 
It is only due to Shackleton’s ability to motivate his people that the crew hasn’t given up altogether at this point. They eat penguins and seals, occasionally killing dogs as well, to conserve food.
In March 1916, the ice floe where the Patience Camp is located successfully makes its way to about 60 miles from Paulet Island, but impassable conditions make floating to the island all but an impossible goal.
Soon after, to the dismay of the crew, the ice floe begins to break, and Shackleton has to plan a trip to some kind of a nearby land—using nothing more than three lifeboats.
On April 9, 1916, the ice pack breaks in two, and The James Caird, Stancomb Wills and Dudley Docker are launched for a voyage to Elephant Island, a remote and uninhabited island far from all shipping lanes. But also, at this point, Shackleton’s crew’s only hope.
After six miserable days, the three lifeboats land on Elephant Island on April 15, the first time that the 28 men touch solid ground after precisely 497 days! 
Though remote and uninhabited, Elephant Island is much more reliable than a lifeboat or an ice floe, so the crew is happy and relieved. Shackleton is not: he knows that this is merely the beginning of the rescue journey.
Barely nine days after setting up a camp at Elephant Island, Shackleton chooses the five strongest men in his crew— Captain 
, second officer 
 carpenter 
, and seamen 
 and 
—and the best boat—the James Caird—and sets off for South Georgia, where a whaling station is located and where he hopes to get some help.
The extremely dangerous journey lasts for two weeks. But finally, on May 10, the James Caird reaches the south coast of South Georgia! Unfortunately, they reach land there on the far side of the island. 
So, merely a few days after reaching South Georgia, the exhausted Shackleton, Crean and Worsley—facing the fact that the James Caird is now too unseaworthy to use it to go round the island—set out on yet another dangerous and never-before-done journey to reach the Stromness whaling station by crossing South Georgia on foot!
About a day later, the three men are stirred to hear the sound of a factory whistle:
Finally, the men reach the Stromness whaling station, and Worsley immediately sails back to pick up the three men left behind.
The mission is not complete, though: there are 22 men still on Elephant Island and they are all waiting to be saved.
During the months of May and June, using borrowed ships (Southern Sky, Instituto de Pesca No. 1, and Emma), Shackleton embarks on a series of unsuccessful rescue attempts to reach Elephant Island, where the other men of his crew have, in the meantime, all but given up on hope.
Finally, on August 30, 1916, during his 4
 rescue attempt aboard the steam tug Yelcho (loaned to him by the Chilean government), Shackleton reaches Elephant Island and rescues all 22 remaining members of his original expedition, 2 years and 22 days since leaving England.
On September 3, 1916, the Yelcho reaches Punta Arenas, with all 28 members of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition aboard.
Endurance Epilogue
After his death, the name of Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton—who died in debts due to many failed business endeavors—was largely forgotten by both his compatriots and the world, contrary to that of his one-time captain and longtime rival afterward, Robert Falcon Scott.
However, in the decades that followed, things changed, and nowadays it is Scott whose heroism and leadership qualities are often questioned, while Shackleton’s name has become almost synonymous with the word “leadership.”

Our Critical Review
There’s a reason why people remember Alfred Lansing for this book, and why they remember Shackleton’s failed expedition primarily through it: 
is an exceptionally researched and beautifully written book on a topic
And by “beautifully written,” we mean “written in a way they don’t write books anymore”: Lansing’s prose belongs more to the 19
 century than to the modern age, but that should be off-putting only to those who, unlike the protagonist of the book, are not persistent and tenacious enough to swim through the breathtaking layers of meaning and reach the surface both richer and more perceptive.A classic of exploration literature, 
is a story of heroic failure, and since heroic failure touches people even more than heroic success, it’s bound to remain engraved in your memory for quite some time.

“It’s fine, Ree. No big deal,” she said to her daughter when Marie asked her if the radio was broken. “The antenna got busted and the tuner dial was a little off, so I’m fixing it.”
Awestruck and mesmerized by her mother “working her magic,” Marie finally uttered the words that had been on her mind for quite some time: “Hey, Mom, how do you know how to do so many different things that you’ve never done before, without anyone showing you how to do it?”
(Remember, these are the 1980s we’re talking about, which means it was a “pre-internet, pre-YouTube, pre-Google world.”)
“Don’t be silly, Ree,” Marie’s mom replied. “Nothing in life is that complicated. You can do whatever you set your mind to if you just roll up your sleeves, get in there, and do it. Everything is figureoutable.”
Choose to Be Someone Else: The Magic of Belief
The last three words quoted above took root in Marie’s soul. 
Ever since her mother uttered them for the first time, they have been the most powerful driving force in her life. 
No wonder they form the very title of her second book! 
The subtitle, in addition, describes Marie’s opinion about their power better than we’ll ever be able to: “one simple belief to create unstoppable success.” 
The emphasis here should be on belief. And why, you ask?
Because, in Marie’s opinion, that’s where everything starts. “Beliefs,” she writes poetically, “are the hidden scripts that run our lives. Like a track running underneath a train, our beliefs determine where we go and how we get there.”
You see, humans are exceptional in that we have been given the gift of thinking. When Ralph Waldo Emerson writes that “the ancestor of every action is a thought,” he’s not being metaphorical as you might think.
And that’s because virtually everything you can see around you—from your clothes and your books to your phone and your house—was once 
a thought, an idea, “a wild, formless figment of someone’s imagination.”
But that’s where the process of creation starts, which many people would simplify to these four steps:
Thought → Feeling → Behavior → Result
Marie Forleo, however, thinks that we should add another step before these four. She writes:
This force that “underpins every action we take and how we interpret and respond to the world around us” is, of course, our beliefs, which Forleo defines as the things you know “with total and absolute certainty… the root of our reality and our results.”
So, that creation formula above should really look something like this:
Beliefs → Thought → Feeling → Behavior → Result
Get that: right beliefs bring great thoughts and feelings which affect our behavior and results in the wished-for outcomes. 
Wrong beliefs, on the other hand…
The Problem with Our Beliefs, aka Eliminating Excuses
Well, we don’t even need to complete the sentence above, do we?
Forleo suggests that the problem with our beliefs is enormous and threefold: 
#1. They are often instinctively created, and while we’re not paying attention (through the power of the 5 Es: environment, experience, evidence, examples, and envisioning); 
#2. They are frequently self-limiting (because protecting yourself is much more important than risking it to become more than you are); 
#3. They are self-perpetuating (in that, if you don’t think you can do something, you’ll never try doing it, so the belief that you can’t do it will remain unchanged).
So, in other words, unless you test out your beliefs, you’ll never change them. More importantly – and this is the point Forleo is trying to make – untested beliefs are merely superstitions and excuses. In other words, 
. 
And choices 
 be changed.
Choosing to believe that “everything is figureoutable” means choosing to believe that there is a solution to every problem. It means realizing that all of your “can’ts” are actually “won’ts,” and that 
. Finally, it means making an effort to overcome your perceived limitations as opposed to embracing them in the form of excuses.
Because, really, once you think about it, all of your self-limiting beliefs are merely excuses:
Of all the excuses, this is perhaps the most common. In reality, it doesn’t hold water because you have plenty of time – you’re just not using it right. 
“If it’s important enough, I’ll make the time,” Forleo writes. “If not, I’ll make an excuse.”
Think of it this way: if your doctor told you today that you are going to die in two years or so, would you be able to find enough time for your friends and your passion projects?
Of course you would!
Because you’re spending quite a few hours on social media on a daily basis, you’re answering emails even in your sleep, you’re binge-watching Netflix shows constantly (yup, even the ones you don’t really care about that much), etc. etc. 
The point?
, it shouldn’t be that difficult to use Facebook a bit less or watch one Netflix episode less than you would in a single day.
That already amounts to about an hour in a day or 45 full 8-hour workdays in a year, which Forleo translates into at least a draft of your book or a career change! And even with half of that – so, just 30 minutes a day – you get 22 full 8-hour workdays in a year or just about enough to learn how to meditate, build a brand-new website, or 
.
You don’t have the time?
Oh, no: you are not making the effort to 
the time!
More often than not, you don’t even need the money!
There are so many free resources on the Internet that really, you’ll find just about enough videos on YouTube only to learn any kind of new skill – not to mention all the MOOCs and free university courses available out there!
But, let’s say that you 
 need money for your business venture. 
Once again, there are a host of ways to get the financing you need – you just need to be determined, creative, and relentless enough to endure.
Forleo’s has five suggestions to spark your imagination and only one of them doesn’t start with “S”:
This is the flimsiest excuse of them all and Forleo doesn’t waste too many words to refute it.
“We live in the most unprecedented time in human history,” she writes.
“There are two kinds of people in the world,” concludes Forleo, “those with reasons and those with results.” 
Which one of the two do you 
 to be?
How to Deal with the Fear of Anything
OK, enough about the excuses! What about our fears?
Well, first of all, it is important to note that everyone is afraid, from newbies to icons, from writers, performers and athletes to entrepreneurs, soldiers and scientists. (
.)
However, as French author André Gide wrote once, “there are very few monsters who warrant the fear we have of them.” In other words, the more you understand something, the less you’ll fear it.
And this is what does the trick!
According to Marie Forleo, the difference between successful people and you is not the type or the degree of your fears, but the way you interpret them.
For example, when Bruce Springsteen goes on stage – and this happens every time – his heart beats a little faster, his hands sweat a little, and his legs go numb as if he’s getting pins and needles. However, he doesn’t think of these feelings as fear – the symptoms of which are the same – but as “excitement.”
“Fascinating, right?” quips Forleo. “Springsteen interprets those body sensations as a sign of readiness, not a sign that he’s afraid, anxious, or incompetent. He’s chosen to believe that the vibrations and sensations in his physical vessel are telling him he’s prepared to give his fans a legendary performance. He’s 
 an interpretation that serves him.”
Shannon L. Adler says that most misunderstandings in the world could be avoided if people would simply take the time to ask, “What else could this mean?” Well, Forleo thinks that most failures and millions of unfulfilled hearts can be avoided in much the same manner.
Because, in one way or another, what you fear the most is often what you want to do more than anything. “Nine times out of ten,” Marie writes, “our fear is directive. It’s a signpost, pointing us in the exact direction our soul wants to go.”
You’re crippled by fear that your book won’t be good enough so you haven’t started writing it?
You’re, in fact, told, and in no uncertain terms, by your very own body that you must put something on paper and you must do this fast. 
The moment you will, the amazing feeling of relief that will overcome your body will tell you that you’ve been postponing the wrong thing all this time.
Fear is your soul’s GPS. 
Follow it.
And never forget: no matter what happens on your journey, everything is figureoutable. 
Key Lessons from “Everything Is Figureoutable”
1.      Impossible Is Only What You Believe Is
2.      Your Road Map to Results
3.      The World Needs Your Special Gift
Impossible Is Only What You Believe Is
“What is now proved,” wrote William Blake in his 
a few centuries ago, “was once only imagined.” 
Marie Forleo goes a step further: and what was once imagined, she adds by implication, was a product of that person’s beliefs.
In other words, if one doesn’t believe that something is possible, one would never be able to picture it clearly, let alone proceed to the realization of that idea.
Just think of what 
 is doing right now, while you’re reading this summary: he’s building rockets that should take humanity to Mars in some not so distant future. Would he have even started doing that if he didn’t believe it was possible?
Of course not.
And this is where Forleo’s philosophy of life is rooted in. She firmly believes that your life will start getting better the very minute you stop believing that “achieving your dreams are impossible” and start using her mother’s mantra: “everything is figureoutable.” 
Your Road Map to Results
Marie Forleo’s philosophy of life can be further described in a few actionable bits of advice – some of which she uses to introduce her book to her readers. Let’s try to adapt them in an even more meaningful manner:
Instead of thinking things like “I know this already” or “This won’t work for me” – Forleo calls these two sentences “destructive thought viruses” – start constantly asking yourself questions such as “
can I learn from this?” and “
can this work for me?”
Unfortunately, most of our beliefs are not only self-limiting but also quite unchangeable. 
Why?
Because they are not tested.
That’s why you need to try doing things before denying that you can do them.
The everything-is-figureoutable philosophy of life is based on three rules of play:
. All problems (or dreams) are figureoutable.
. If a problem is not figureoutable, it’s not really a problem—it’s a fact of life or law of nature (e.g., death or gravity).
. You may not care enough to figure this problem out or achieve this particular dream. That’s okay. Find another problem or dream that ignites a blazing fire in your heart and go back to Rule 1.
You know what that old adage implies: the uncommitted look for excuses; the ones who 
 want to achieve something – look for a solution.
Or as Forleo says, “there are two kinds of people in the world: those with reasons and those with results.”
The truth is that your 
are actually 
because if you want to do something, you’ll find a way to do it.
On the contrary, fear is your soul’s GPS.
What you fear the most – quitting your job, starting that book, investing in that new startup – is probably what you want to do more than anything.
Reinterpret your fears and follow them: they’ll lead you in the right direction.
Most people plan too much and do too little.
The problem is that they want to have all figured out in advance. 
That’s not the right attitude!
When you can, be a “doer,” not a “thinker.” Overcome your indecisiveness by making the first step. Clarity will come afterward, as you make your progress.
Speaking of which, progress puts you in a productive mindset and that’s the only thing you should strive for. Always tend to ask “what’s my next move?” and not “what will others think of this when I’m finished?”
The World Needs Your Special Gift
Finally, and most importantly, never forget that you are a unique human being with unique qualities and the capabilities to make unique contributions to this world.
You have so much to offer. Overcome 
 by talking about it with others and by doing the things that make you happy regardless of other people’s opinions. 
If you’re not doing that, if you’re crippled by fear and you’re still making up excuses, you’re actually 
from the people you love the most by not making the contribution only you can make.

Ever wondered how Wikipedia became Wikipedia without a leader?
Emmanuel Gobillot did years before people even took notice. 
Leadership must be reinvented for the age of mass collaboration, he suggested, and incorporate this paradigm shift in itself:

doing.

“Leadershift PDF Summary”
, 
by Emmanuel Gobillot – not to be confused with the same-titled book by 
 – tries to see how the age of mass collaboration and horizontal hierarchical structures affects the position of the leader, until recently (and all the way from the Stone Age) a clearly defined title role one could only get based on his “experience, expertise and control.”
However, Gobillot claims, this is an outdated model of leadership, and we can only guess the one that is soon to be introduced via the “mass collaboration” paradigm shift. Since nothing of that sort has ever happened before, he writes, “there are few, if any, clues from the past to inform the way we can be successful in the future, we are unlikely to get insights into becoming leaders in the next generation by looking back at our experiences or our elders.”
So, suitably, Gobillot looks forward: he analyzes which factors have contributed to the “leadershift” of the title and then he suggests what kind of adjustments leaders are supposed to make to keep up with time. In essence, this makes 
a book of four trends and four shifts – we summarize them all below!
The Day of Reckoning: We Need a New Type of Leader
 opens with a tellingly beautiful quote by 
 author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry – “As for the future, your task is not to foresee it, but to enable it” – which Gobillot comments upon soon after, thus:
In other words, according to Gobillot, the future has arrived and in a form not really predicted by capitalism: people are mass collaborating on projects in a way that has allowed practically anonymous contributors to create the most comprehensive (and perhaps the very best) encyclopedia in history (
) without nothing but a desire and a self-perfecting list of rules created on the go by the very same community.
The financial turbulences of 2008, Gobillot says, are practically minor compared to this type of “pervasive… clear-air turbulence.” The former he deems short-term (even though writing in the midst of the crisis), but the latter he rightly sees as affecting the leadership role in the long run – if not irreversibly.
“Whilst the first type of turbulence questions our 
 as leaders,” he writes, “the second kind questions the very 
 of leadership.”
The Four Trends That Question the Essence of Leadership
As each day passes, “the way leaders create value becomes less effective.” Put in simpler terms, the very levers they rely on – experience, knowledge, effort, and power – “are being eroded by four major trends.”
Gobillot names these trends the Demographic, the Expertise, the Attention, and the Democratic trend – and he explains why they spell (quite literally, since the four trends actually form the acronym DEAD), the death of leadership as we know it.
The first trend eroding the levers of traditional leadership is the demographic trend since it quite forcefully makes your experience (one of the tenets of leadership) irrelevant and obsolete.
“In a nutshell, the demographic trend is we now find ourselves with multiple generations with multiple socio-cultural backgrounds working alongside each other,” writes Gobillot. “Each brings with it its own hopes, fears, expectations, and experiences that other generations do not understand and to which they cannot relate.”
How does this affect your leadership position?
Well, put simply, no matter what kind of experience you have, you’ll be leading a group of people who will most definitely have a different background (and, thus, experiences) than you. Gone are the days of 
, as are the days of the overtly racist and/or covertly sexist work environment.
Nowadays, you’ll have to lead, at the same time, a 52-year-old blue-collar American manager, a 37-year-old female Mexican designer with expertise in at least one different area, and a 23-year-old African-American intern with a dream.
Your experience (no matter how wide-ranging) would never help you empathize with all of your workers – if only a third. And when that happens, when your experience bears no resemblance to the experience of people who you are called to lead – or in no way offers you any insight into what might make you successful – you risk becoming absolutely irrelevant.
Think of Wikipedia once again.
Though very few of the people who contribute to it are consensually deemed experts in their fields, numerous foremost experts in 
 fields start their research on Wikipedia where they can find info on anything from Thomas Mann’s bibliography to all the previous Academy Award nominees for a foreign movie to current advancements in quantum physics.
That’s the power of Web 2.0, the participative/social web which, according to Wikipedia of course, “refers to websites that emphasize user-generated content, ease of use, participatory culture and interoperability (i.e., compatible with other products, systems, and devices) for end-users.”
Until very recently, many organizations existed because this was impossible and because they helped significantly in reducing the contractual costs of managing multiple relationships. However, now that technology has allowed “for networks to create value in a much more inclusive, and therefore powerful way than organizations can,” they are not as necessary.
In other words, if an encyclopedia can be written without leaders and if billions of DIY tutorials and MOOC courses are available for free online, then is there really a need for an expert leader in any field? Why shouldn’t they be replaced by software as well?
The third trend that makes traditional leadership outmoded is the attention trend: we are just incapable of paying attention to everything that happens around us. Consequently, it is irrelevant how much you try as a leader: a lot of your work will definitely go unnoticed.
Here are just a few mind-boggling stats Gobillot provides that make his case even clearer:
• The average e-mail user received 65,000 messages during 2009 alone (it’s probably even more today).
• More than 300,000 books are published every year.
• The average weekday edition of 
 contains more information than someone would have come across in his or her lifetime in 17th-century England.
• Forty exabytes (4 × 10
) of unique information is produced in a year – more than was produced in the previous 5,000 years taken together. 
• There are around 2 billion web pages and the Internet is 500 larger than the 91 million daily Google searches can ever show.
• A typical supermarket stocks around 40,000 items.
“So, where do you focus?” asks Gobillot. “Where do you go for answers?”
Bombarded by messages and information, modern human beings have no choice but to be selective: selectiveness is “our way of cutting through the information clutter and the demands on our attention.”
Organizations were used to an essential part of the network of attention, but “a collection of social and informational networks is coming to replace them as a source of coherence and cohesion for people.”
To Gobillot, the reason is clear: “they replicate more closely the way we seek engagement than organizations have been able to achieve through their narrow focus on roles, rules, and economic incentives, rather than on individuals and their sense of moral and social obligations.”
Put simply, the attention trend means that everyone is living in a filter bubble now to make sense of the world and leaders are being 
. 
“In the democratic world,” writes Gobillot, “leaders are no longer an accident of birth. We can choose whom to follow. We even get to vote whenever we want. In this world, the leader never gets to call the election.”
Consequently, leaders are devoid of positional power and unable to engage people. Free agencies and freelancers make it all but impossible for them to create followers: the very idea of being “an employee” has nothing to do with what that word meant to our parents and our parents’ parents.
You can’t lead someone who can leave after a year, can you? And they are not fully engaged with any organization, are they?
The Four Shifts: Meeting Change Head-On
Since the four trends explicated above, taken together, spell the death of leadership as we know it, if you want to remain relevant as a leader today, you need to wiggle your way through the changes by becoming a new type of a leader. 
Even though, at first glance, the trends above seem damning to the very need of leaders in the modern world, in reality, it is not so: though members of a community don’t necessarily act as 
, they do need to feel as if they belong to the community for the community to thrive. And, as all human beings do, they fear being expelled.
Modern leaders should work to allay these fears and fortify the feeling of belonging, by securing engagement, ensuring alignment, creating accountability and obtaining commitment. These, according to Gobillot, are the four shifts that would transform traditional leadership into modern leadershift, an alternative method to govern mass collaboration communities.
The arch-nemesis of connection is complexity: when one feels unable to understand the instructions for engagement or the interface that stands between them and the community, they simply give up trying to become a member without even trying.
That’s why it should be the first job of a leader to make the transition between being outside of a community and inside it as smooth as possible. Leaders should work hard to eliminate complexity, by simplifying everything – “processes, products, reporting lines and channels” – even if that means eliminating legacy processes and systems. 
In addition to this, they should always provide coherence, because a community that grants independence to its members would soon stop being a community. “Coherence is the ability to highlight the interdependence of a system,” i.e., the ability to demonstrate to every member of a team that though being a simple clog, he/she is an essential part of the whole.
By definition, leaders must answer two critical questions: 1) How do I ensure that community members understand their involvement in the social process (i.e., how do they best contribute)? And 2) How do I make sure that people stay aligned behind the mission?
In the past, both of these questions were answered with a plan. But plans are now just vestiges of some bygone times since they have in their very nature engraved the idea of a top-to-down hierarchy. 
The modern age is an age of narratives: people don’t want to hear orders and instructions, but they want to be part of a story that unites them. “The role of the leader,” writes Gobillot, “is to facilitate the narrative – helping participants and the community define who they are, what they aspire to and how they hope to get there.”
If you are a leader, always remember that the best narratives are the ones that are able of providing an answer to three all-important questions: “Who are we?” “Where are we going?” and “Why are we going there?”
If you are working in the IT-sector, you already know what Gobillot means by this third shift (and can probably discern his farsightedness).
Namely, once again, the idea of a “role” is a remnant of the time when vertical hierarchy was believed to be the only way to structure the relationship in an organization. Each member, thus, becomes a function of a superstructure, and it is not through his individuality and uniqueness that he/she is asked to contribute, but through his ability and skillset to conform to his function/role.
That, however, came with a burden: people were asked to leave their social roles outside the door of their companies.
It is, fortunately, quite different nowadays: because of the advancements in technology, social roles do not need to interfere with organizational roles. You can be whoever you like to be – not just outside of work, but inside as well (
). 
Though roles are not easily disposable even in modern work environments, they are now much more fluid and flexible, and the best organizations can easily think of their workers (regardless of their job titles) in terms of tasks. Tasks are listed and are up for grabs – giving leaders the opportunity to easily detect hard workers from slackers and hold the latter accountable, even if they work from home.
They used to teach leaders that money is the ultimate motivator. However, as numerous studies have demonstrated (
), after a certain limit (and especially in certain professions) money tends to 
.
Fortunately, during the past few decades, 
. So, leaders need to change if they want to achieve commitment from their workers. Stats have shown that if the mission of your company doesn’t align with your employees’ interests, after one or two pay rises, you can do absolutely nothing to motivate them unless you change your company’s course.
Love works much better than money: it motivates beyond every point and limit. People would do absolutely everything for an organization and a leader they love.
To become one of the latter, start first by 
 your job as well: if you don’t love it, say goodbye to the possibility of socially incentivizing your employees. Then, start concentrating on the community rather than concentrating on your individual workers.
“For leaders,” writes Gobillot, “this may be somewhat counter-intuitive as we have been told as leaders that we need to understand what motivates an individual and focus our efforts on maximizing that motivation. But what matters to the functioning of our communities is not what motivates individuals but rather that they direct that motivation to making the community stronger.”

3.      A Redefined Role: The Four Shifts in Leadership
Traditional Leadership Is an Outdated Model
Traditional leadership was based on several unquestionable tenets: expertise, experience, control, domineering presence, authority. None of them matter anymore, says Gobillot – at least not in a world of mass collaboration that has produced Wikipedia.
The Four Trends That Have Eroded the Tenets of Traditional Leadership into Obsolesce 
Four major societal trends have forever transformed the role of leadership in the 21
 century and beyond:
• 
 means that multiple generations from different races, genders, and ethnic backgrounds now work alongside each other – each with demands and experiences that others cannot comprehend. Consequently, your experience as a leader is not enough.
• 
 means that “expertise is now to be found as much outside as inside the organization”: the knowledge of the people who wrote 
 is irrelevant because a bunch of much less knowledgeable people was able to create 
. 
• 
 means that “organizations have to fight harder than ever to capture the attention of employees and customers as information and interaction sources lay claim to limited time.” Think smartphones, emails, video games, TV channels, Netflix, HBO and all the other distractions out there.
• 
means that “the likelihood of leaders having direct control (rather than dotted lines or no lines at all) over their resources is remote.” Think freelancers and agencies.
A Redefined Role: The Four Shifts in Leadership
To counter the four trends, leaders need to change significantly, making four all-important shifts from the traditional leadership model. Where they once relied on clarity, plans, roles, and money to create a working community, they now need to rely on:
• 
 the more complex the instructions are, the less 
 a member of the community is. Consequently, everything needs to be simplified and made coherent, combining both purpose and straightforwardness of use.
• 
: plans are a list of orders, i.e., remnant of top-to-down hierarchical structure. To 
 the members of your community with a single mission, you need to ensure that they are all part of the organization’s arching story.
• 
: in an ever-changing environment, roles that define 
 must make way for tasks – a member of a community is not merely a function of an organization, but someone who can choose their own destiny by combining several different tasks pertaining to their interest and skillset
• 
: Money motivates only to a certain point. Love motivates beyond it. Make your employees love their job, rather than trying to buy their 
: it doesn’t work anymore.

“Leadershift Quotes”
Our Critical Review
It is fascinating to think how redundant seems 
merely a decade after being published. 
Ten years ago, it may have been all but revolutionary, but nowadays, what Gobillot had so farsightedly observed years before other leaders, is part of the common knowledge.
In other words, many of the things Gobillot suggests you should do as a leader, you’re 
 doing – merely via the force of necessity. 
But don’t take away nothing from him: as 
 proves, he 
 that the role of the leader will be redefined completely at a time when very few people even bothered questioning the concept of traditional leadership.
Hats off to Gobillot for that!"

Racism is still a serious problem in the United States – even in the 21
 century.
The problem, it seems, is the way our human nature evolved. 
As Jennifer L. Eberhardt demonstrates, you don’t have to be racist to be:
Who Should Read “Biased”? And Why?

About Jennifer L. Eberhardt

A winner of the MacArthur Fellowship in 2014, Eberhardt is also a co-director of SPARQ (Social Psychological Answers to Real-World Questions) and a member of the National Academy of Sciences ever since 2016.
Dubbed one of Foreign Policy’s 100 Leading Global Thinkers, Eberhardt is the author of numerous studies on racial discrimination and implicit bias, but 
is her first book.
“Biased PDF Summary”
Whether you want to admit to yourself or not, you are irrefutably, at least to some extent, a racist—though that’s not the right term.
You see, we are born with something modern social psychologists refer to as “implicit bias,” that is to say, an innate predilection for people who look like us coupled with an immediate suspicion against those who are different.
Jennifer L. Eberhardt’s magisterial study, 
, is an examination of precisely this: implicit bias—what it is, where it comes from, how it affects us, and how we can address it. 
Describing the phenomenon as “a kind of distorting lens that’s a product of both the architecture of our brain and the disparities in our society,” Eberhardt explains right away that it can be associated with everything, i.e., we can hold biases based on all sorts of characteristics: skin color, age, weight, ethnic origin, accent, disability, height, gender.
However, 
is primarily about race, and primarily about the relationship between blacks and whites, not only because “the racial dynamics between blacks and whites are dramatic, consequential, and enduring,” but also because these two groups “have been studied the most by researchers investigating bias.”
“We all have ideas about race, even the most open-minded among us,” writes Eberhardt in a further delineation of the subject-matter of her book
“Those ideas have the power to bias our perception, our attention, our memory, and our actions—all despite our conscious awareness or deliberate intentions. Our ideas about race are shaped by the stereotypes to which we are exposed on a daily basis. And one of the strongest stereotypes in American society associates blacks with criminality.”
But is this not, once again, the 
 at play? Namely, how could there be such a thing as a prevailing stereotype if it is not based on something factual? But if it is factual, then why is it a stereotype as well? Also, if there’s no truth in associating blacks with criminality, then why are so many African-Americans in prison? Can we do something about it?
These are all questions that 
tries to answer. Chapter by chapter, we’ll try to sum up Eberhardt’s answers and analyses below.
Part I: What Meets the Eye
Back in 2000, a now 
 revealed something quite remarkable: London cab drivers had enlarged posterior hippocampal regions (the part of the brain that plays a critical role in spatial memory and navigation) in comparison with a control group of people who didn’t drive cabs for a living. 
In fact, the connection was even more blatant: the longer the drivers had been on the job and the more experience they had, the larger their posterior hippocampus.
This inspired Jennifer L. Eberhardt to ask herself a somewhat frightening question: “Because our experiences in the world are reflected in our brains, might our expertise in recognizing faces of our own race—and failing to recognize those of others—display its own neurobiological signature as well?”
To answer this question, Eberhardt joined a team of Stanford scientists who studied something known as the fusiform face area (FFA). Buried deep near the base of the brain, the FFA helps us distinguish the familiar from the unfamiliar, friend from foe. It is widely thought to be “both primitive and fundamental to our survival as a species. Affiliation is a basic human need. Without the ability to track the identity of those around us, we are left alone, vulnerable, and exposed.”
What did the study find out?
“By tracking the activation of the FFA over multiple displays of strangers’ faces,” writes Eberhardt, “we found that the FFA was responding more vigorously to faces that were the same race as the study participant…. We also found that the more dramatic the FFA response to a specific face, the more likely the study participants were able to recognize that stranger’s face when they were shown the photograph again later, outside the scanner.”
In other words, the experiment was the first neuroimaging study to uncover that we are both 
 and 
 hardwired to feel affiliation toward those who look like us. Even more, that there is “a neural component to the same-race advantage in the face-recognition process.”
And, you know what? On a certain intuitive level, we 
know this!
To demonstrate this, Eberhardt refers to the numerous recent cases of black teens snatching purses from middle-aged Chinese women in Oakland’s Chinatown. At first, the police wondered why did the attacks targeted such a specific group of people, but, soon after, profilers unearthed the reason: the black teenagers knew that Chinese women would have problems differentiating between them and, thus, would be unable to identify them even if caught.
And we all suffer from this type of racial blindness, which is the by-product of the same-race advantage in the face-recognition process. The less one has interacted with members of another race, the more they tend to generalize about that race. 
And not merely in terms of psychology or behavior (that is, the intangibles), but also in terms of something quite visible and discernible such as appearance. Just as to an average middle-aged Chinese woman all black teenagers look the same, to an average black teenager, all Chinese middle-aged women are identical as well.
Humans, as species, rely on this kind of “categorizing” to manage information more efficiently. Whether we like it or not, it “is a fundamental tool that our brains are wired to use. And the categorization process applies not just to people; it works on all things. Just as we place people into categories, we place other animals into categories. We place food into categories. We place furniture into categories. And we fill every category we develop with information and imbue it with feelings that guide our actions toward it.”
However, since categorizing precedes experience (
), and since 
, we tend to notice only things that support our preconceived beliefs and ignore facts that contradict them. And we teach our children to do the same through our actions, conscious or unconscious.
It’s a vicious circle we can best illustrate by taking a quote from the “Introduction” to 
 (rather than from the second chapter):
Part II: Where We Find Ourselves
Remember the case of Philando Castile? 
Back in 2016, he was shot seven times by a policeman named Jeronimo Yanez in front of the eyes of his girlfriend and 4-year-old daughter after being stopped for a traffic violation. 
And what about Tamir Rice?
He was just 12 years old and playing with a toy gun in a park in Cleveland, Ohio, when a 26-year-old police officer Timothy Loehmann shot him in the torso, before even parking his car. And he wasn’t even charged with a crime.
Black lives matter—but they matter less to whites. And the reason is simple: they don’t see black people the way black people see each other: they see them as natural threats. Eberhardt did a couple of studies that uncovered that white police officers are more inclined to focus their attention on a black face after being shown a word related to criminal activity.
In other words, it is an unconscious association.
This is why even though merely 1% of all police interactions with civilians are non-violent, black people suffer the most: white police officers, even when stopping them for something minor, 
them to be violent due to their preconceived notions and act accordingly.
Eberhardt and her team analyzed about 28,000 police stops between 2013 and 2014 to see if the hypothesis described above bears a relation with reality.
Unfortunately, it does: based on the factual data, police officers disproportionately more often both stopped and arrested black residents even in the cases when blacks and whites were stopped for precisely the same violation. This, in turn, resulted in the quite expected reinforcement of the stereotype: more blacks are in prison, meaning more blacks 
be in prison.
The numbers don’t lie: 1 out of 4 black people was handcuffed during these police stops even when no arrest was made. The same held true for only 1 out of 15 white people. According to police officers, it was for safety reasons. And this is the best illustration of implicit bias you can find.
To make matters worse, the mass incarceration of African-Americans is becoming more and more problematic because the vicious circle goes in the opposite direction as well. Namely, just as white police officers don’t trust “male blacks” because they are polluted with this type of skepticism (both organically and culturally), “male blacks” do not trust police officers either, because they feel that they are being discriminated; and so, they discriminate back.
As Jill Leovy pointed out in 
, in more than one way, in African-American ghettos, it’s not gangs that produce lawlessness, but lawlessness that produces gangs.
So, the way out isn’t 
 imprisoned people, but, as paradoxically as it may sound, 
 law:
As Michelle Alexander demonstrated in 
, mass incarceration is basically a modern variant of slavery, because it is not mostly an African-American problem—but it is also, almost exclusively, an 
 problem (with blacks).
Even though African-Americans make up only about one-tenth of the overall population in the USA, almost half of the imprisoned men and women are African-Americans! That’s a staggering discrepancy that, obviously, cannot be easily explained in any rational manner whatsoever.
It’s not only that detention rates for blacks are four times higher than for white as we described above, but it is also that, on average, their bail is 35% higher!
No wonder a federal investigation following the death of Michael Brown – who was fatally shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri – discovered that blacks often suffer due to something they referred to as “unlawful bias”!
On March 3, 1991, Rodney King was violently beaten by LAPD officers during his arrest for fleeing and evading on California State Route 210. Even though the police officers spoke of Rodney King using unambiguous racial terms (equating African-Americans with apes) they were eventually acquitted, an event that sparked the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Just recently, 
: every time one of them touched the ball, supporters of the Bulgarian national team imitated ape sounds. And this is not an isolated incident: it happens so often, in fact, that numerous games have been halted because of this—in France only.
Eberhardt demonstrates how this type of racial abuse is not isolated in time as well: it has a sound historical basis in many pseudoscientific theories of the 19
 century that presented African-Americans as sub-humans. 
Many people nowadays believe this, even though it is a known fact that all humans have descended from Africa and share a common ancestry.
Part III: The Way Out
Even when stats show otherwise, most Americans (even blacks) tend to associate the presence of a majority of blacks in a neighborhood with higher crime rates. Because of this, modern American society is still segregated.
And what does this lead to?
Here’s a good example: at Nextdoor.com—a social network app which connects about 200,000 US neighborhoods—even though most of the people go to sell something or find a good plumber, from time to time, a “suspicious black man” post appears. 
This type of racial profiling became a serious problem a few years back and the company contacted Eberhardt to find a solution. Eberhardt realized that all of these posts owe their existence to the implicit bias present in people: they judge these “suspicious black men” based on their appearance, and not based on their behavior.
But that’s what tends to occur 
: the innate biases and categorizations buried within you flow to the surface because the brain has to make an instant decision. However, when you’re thinking slow, you can rationalize the process.
And that’s what Eberhardt suggested Nextdoor should do: find a way to delay the posting of “suspicious black man” alerts. So, Nextdoor added some friction and since about two years ago, for the crime and safety tab, you can’t just write—you have to identify some behavior that is actually suspicious. 
And this process includes “a checklist of reminders” that people have to click through before they can post something about someone “suspicious”:
• Focus on behavior. What was the person doing that concerned you, and how does it relate to a possible crime?
• Give a full description, including clothing, to distinguish between similar people. Consider unintended consequences if the description is so vague that an innocent person could be targeted.
• Don’t assume criminality based on someone’s race or ethnicity. Racial profiling is expressly prohibited.
Thus, the people at Nextdoor managed to delay the initial response of concerned citizens, making its users think and slowing them down.
The result?
They managed to curb racial profiling by about 75%!
As everybody knows, racism and implicit bias can be tackled (and 
 tackled) by the process of desegregation. The reason is obvious: the more time people of different racial backgrounds spend with each other, the less they are inclined to act on instinct for the simple reason that instinct can now give way to experience.
However, 
 people that are primed to despise each other into contact has precisely the opposite effect: it merely confirms biases and inevitably leads to serious issues. Finding common ground with someone your body and mind tell you is different from you can only be achieved through frequent contact—and only over periods of time.
Unfortunately—and almost unconsciously—we seem to have started treading a wrong path, as the result of which, according to research by the UCLA Civil Rights Project, “the number of intensely segregated schools—where less than 10 percent of students are white—has more than tripled in the past thirty years.”
 people to go against their instincts without an explanation is what has this produced this outcome. Most whites think that it is rude to talk of skin color and oftentimes they omit this information even in the case when it is necessary. In addition, they don’t talk about it at all.
“When people focus on not seeing color,” writes Eberhardt, “they may also fail to see discrimination.” To paraphrase Mellody Hobson’s famous TED Talk, the fight against racism 
. People should talk about this openly and freely. And they should talk about it at school, where, unfortunately, so many things are taken at face value nowadays that, according to a 2017 survey, “only 8 percent of high school seniors could identify slavery as the primary reason the South seceded from the Union. Nearly half of the students said it was to protest taxes on imported goods.”
Segregation is only one of the regresses we’ve witnessed during the past decade, as anyone who saw even a single video of the white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017 would testify.
Unfortunately, many white people in the USA are afraid of the changes in US demographics and have started posing the question 
. This has resulted not merely in the upsurge of prejudice against African-Americans, but also in the highly unexpected increase in anti-Semitic violence: just between 2015 and 2017, it spiked 60%! 
Believe it or not, according to a survey by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, 22% of young Americans who came of age in the twenty-first century have never heard of the Holocaust. And two-thirds of them—meaning, four in ten Americans overall—have failed to identify “Auschwitz” as a Nazi death camp!
While we discuss the limits of free speech with people who are advocating equality, right-wing groups have slowly, but surely, regrouped and started 
 things nobody believed would be repeated.
Blatant bigotry is, unfortunately, not a relic of the past. “In truth,” Eberhardt writes, “bias has been biding its time in an implicit world—in a place where we need not acknowledge it to ourselves or to others, even as it touches our soul and drives our behavior.”
One in two white Americans (55% to be exact) believe affirmative action favoring African-Americans discriminates them. 
At the same time, many African-American graduates from top-tier schools “whiten” their CVs (by, say, 
) so as to not trigger their interviewers’ implicit bias. Needless to say, “whitened” CVs 
get more interviews.
Implicit bias, in other words, works inside us (and against those who are not like us) even when we say it doesn’t: that’s why it’s called 
. That’s why it’s hard to eliminate it as well.
However, uncovering cases of implicit bias at work does help because, for one, it paves the way for a rational (i.e. not 
) discussion, and secondly, it helps researchers get to the root cause of it and, thus, suggest ways we can tackle it.
Key Lessons from “Biased”
1.      You Don’t Have to Be Racist to Be Biased 
2.      African-Americans Are Discriminated and Dehumanized
3.      Tackling Implicit Bias Is Difficult—but Doable
You Don’t Have to Be Racist to Be Biased 
“When people think about racism,” says Jennifer L. Eberhardt in 
, “they’re thinking about bigots. But you don’t have to have a moral failing to act on an implicit bias.”
In other words, even if you’re consciously against racists and racism, you are implicitly biased because (as numerous studies have shown) you were programmed by evolution to love the people that are like you and doubt those that are not.
This is implicit bias, a sort of “distorting lens” engraved in your eyes that, unfortunately, gets distorted even more by the disparities in our society.
African-Americans Are Discriminated and Dehumanized
Even though African-Americans make up only 12% of the US population, they also contribute with staggering 40% to the total number of incarcerated criminals in the country. 
If you think that this is because they’ve deserved it more—Justice is blind and all that—think otherwise: Eberhardt studied 28,000 random police stops made between 2013 and 2014 only to discover that African-Americans are habitually handcuffed (1 in 4 individuals) as opposed to white Americans (1 in 15)!
Moreover, the bail for an average African-American detainee is, on average, 35% higher than the bail for a white American.
This is not because someone is consciously discriminating against African-Americans. It is because the people in our institutions are mostly whites and they are 
 to discriminate unconsciously against people who are not like them.
And this goes so far that experiments have shown that white people still think, unconsciously, of black people as something almost sub-human. Racists merely make this equation a bit clearer.
Tackling Implicit Bias Is Difficult—but Doable
Since it is implicit by definition, this discriminatory bias is difficult to be eradicated.
However, there are some things that work to alleviate it:
• Open discussions about cases of implicit bias (
 
about it is what has produced right-wing groups)
• Adding friction in the decision-making processes: the faster a person should decide about something, the more instinctual their decision (that’s why police officers often shoot African-Americans);
• Creating desegregated schools (more contact amounts to more experience and more experience tends to negate bias over time).

Want your kid to be admitted to Yale or Stanford?
Well, let’s face it: chances are he or she probably won’t be. 
Frank Bruni explains why – and why this is not at all a big deal.
The title is the message:
.
Who Should Read “Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be”? And Why?
Nicely written, Frank Bruni’s book targets three different types of audience:
• Prospective college students who want to get a degree from an Ivy League college;
• Parents of prospective college students – and even kindergarten tykes – who think that only an Ivy League college guarantees success and a bright future for their children;
• Everyone who cares about the state of the American educational system.
If you can see yourself belonging to one of these groups – both now and in the recent future – don’t hesitate to pick up this book. It’s important that you do.
About Frank Bruni
A Few Somewhat Ignored Lists That Matter a Lot
“There’s a widespread conviction, spoken and unspoken, that the road to riches is trimmed in Ivy and the reins of power held by those who’ve donned Harvard’s crimson, Yale’s blue and Princeton’s orange, not just on their chests but in their souls,” writes Frank Bruni in the first chapter of 
.
However, not much research is necessary for one to realize that nothing can be further from the truth. We know it sounds strange, but bear with us for two or three lists.
Let’s start with the Fortune 500 list of 2014, the last one to appear before Bruni’s book was published (there are some changes since then as far as the bottom half is concerned, but they are irrelevant to Bruni’s case).
Back in 2014, the largest ten US corporations by total revenue were, in order, Wal-Mart, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Berkshire Hathaway, Apple, Phillips 66, General Motors, Ford Motor, General Electric, and Valero Energy. 
Here’s the list, in the same order of schools where these companies’ CEOs have got their undergraduate degrees: the University of Arkansas; the University of Texas; the University of California, Davis; the University of Nebraska; Auburn; Texas A&M; the General Motors Institute (now called Kettering University); the University of Kansas; Dartmouth College and the University of Missouri–St. Louis.
Yup, that’s right: just one Ivy League school on that list!
OK, you might say, but what about our presidents? 
The last five of them are all Ivy League graduates: Donald Trump got his degree from Penn, Barack Obama from Columbia (and Harvard), both Bushes got their degrees from Yale, and Clinton from Georgetown and then Yale Law.
Widen the circle a bit, however, and you get the full – and much more important – story:
• Ronald Reagan attended Eureka College, a tiny school in Illinois that, in 2014, was ranked only 31st among “Regional Colleges (Midwest)” on the infernal U.S. News & World Report survey.
• Jimmy Carter moved around during his undergraduate and graduate years, landing not just at the U.S. Naval Academy but also at Georgia Southwestern College and Georgia Tech.
• Richard Nixon got his bachelor’s from Whittier College in Southern California. 
• Lyndon Baines Johnson got his from Southwest Texas State Teachers College.
And the same holds true about many presidential nominees, whether Joe Biden, Paul Ryan or John Edwards. Who knows if it is actually a good idea to mention Dan Quayle’s education – the guy couldn’t spell “potato” right – but he made it to the White House and “
 a mere heartbeat away from the presidency… by way of DePauw University in Indiana and law school at Indiana University.”
The Unsung Alma Maters
The point?
Well, to paraphrase the title of Frank Bruni’s words, the point is that the university you decide upon doesn’t, in turn, decide upon your future:
To make the point even clearer, Bruni cites the so-called Platinum Study by sociologist D. Michael Lindsay published just a few months before his book.
The study involved interviews with over 500 American leaders, over half of which were CEOs of major corporations, and more than 100 of which were leaders of major non-profit groups. The leaders also included many government officials and even a few former presidents. The study, expectedly, aimed to discover where all these leaders “came from, how they reached their destinations and how they thought and behaved once they arrived.”
“I fully expected that we would see that a large percentage of people had gone to highly selective schools both for secondary and higher education,” Lindsay told Bruni. 
However, as he wrote in his study-inspired book 
, “while we often assume that the most direct path to national influence goes through major academic universities (such as Ivy League schools), nearly two-thirds of the leaders I interviewed attended schools that are not considered elite institutions.”
Throwing Darts: Everything That’s Wrong with USA’s Educational System
Determined to get into one of the dozen or so most selective institutions of higher learning in America? Rethink your determination—or at least hear out Frank Bruni’s opinion on that subject beforehand:
Of course, the above is an exaggeration, but not by much. 
And here’s why.
Back in 2015, only 5.1% of 42,167 received by Stanford got back an acceptance notice. 
So, that’s just 1 in 20 aspirants. And bear in mind that the other 19 weren’t “slackers, stumblebums, unhinged gamblers or delusional narcissists”—but “accomplished secondary school students for whom Stanford wasn’t and shouldn’t have been a completely ludicrous wish.”
But how attending an Ivy League College got to become such a “ludicrous wish”?
Well, quite simply, it was what the Ivy League Colleges 
 to achieve. You see, scarcity (
) is one of the six universal principles of human behavior, and, unfortunately, one of the main things taken into consideration before a college ranking is published.
Even more unfortunately, scarcity can be manufactured, and this is precisely what Stanford, Yale, or Princeton are doing: they are simultaneously attracting more and more applicants and lowering the acceptance quotes.
To use the words of Ted O’Neill, the dean of admissions at the University of Chicago for several decades until 2009 – a while ago, a surfeit of applications “became a way to promote your college, and the admissions office became, in effect, a public-relations arm of the university.”
If you think that factoring admission rates is the only thing that’s wrong about college rankings, think again.
“Make no mistake,” wrote Jeffrey Benzel in an article, a dean of admissions at Yale, soon after stepping from this job in 2013. “The publication of college rankings is a business enterprise that capitalizes on anxiety about college admissions.”
While choosing a college is indisputably more important than buying a household appliance, he went on, “college rankings systems all take a far less thorough and scientific approach than Consumer Reports does when testing vacuum cleaners. Another problem with rankings is that they allow the dominant player—
, a magazine that has actually gone defunct and exists now only as a purveyor of rankings—to exert undue influence.”
Believe it or not, more than 20% of the score that 
 assigns a school “reflects what high school guidance counselors think of it and the regard in which presidents, provosts and admissions deans at other colleges hold it.”
And how can anyone have in-depth knowledge about any school other than their own? In addition, how does 
measure a college’s “reputation,” another thing that gets calculated into the final ranking? And how does the money a university has relates to the quality of the education it offers?
And yet, the very existence of rankings system makes students opt for the higher-rated universities, despite the fact that some of them may not be the best choice for them on a more important, 
 level.
But the above two are certainly not the only obstacles. A third one is that some of the aspirants are children of previous Ivy League attendees – or are somehow connected to alumni of the institutions.
This is what’s called legacy preference and is what allows some families and people 
. 
Don’t believe that?
You don’t have to, because it is a well-known fact: according to a study done by Michael Hurwitz in 2011, legacies had a 23.3% better chance of admission than non-legacies. Even worse, “primary legacies” had a 45.1 percent better chance.
In other words, between two identical candidates, if a non-legacy has a 30% chance of getting into a certain university, a primary legacy will have about 80% chance, i.e., will almost certainly get an acceptance notice.
Is that… fair?
Speaking of fairness—is it fair that these legacy families are usually very rich, to begin with?
Once again, you don’t have to take Bruni’s word for it: according to a study conducted by former Yale alumni, Rebecca Fabbro, 48% percent of Yale’s students (yes, that’s half of them) are coming from families who make more than $200,000 per year, i.e., are in the top 5% in the USA.
In other words, it’s a self-perpetuating and very vicious circle: the rich gain acceptance at Ivy League colleges because of their connections, and their children because of their legacies.
Obsessive Parents and As Obsessive Children
However, because even poor parents know that getting into an Ivy School College is a one-way ticket to success, they are willing to do anything to get their children any type of advantage.
Of course, in a market-based society, that amounts to the establishment of numerous institutions that are willing to help them – and earn quite a lot of money in return.
You need nothing more but a single piece of information to realize how crazy things are: because getting the head start has become an obsession for parents, there are organizations (in 
!) which offer “guidance and test preparation for kids vying for admission to selective grammar schools, kindergartens, and even preschools.”
One of them, the Aristotle Circle (founded by a former investment banker who had done her undergraduate work at MIT before getting an MBA at Columbia), receives $450 for every hour of tutoring.
No wonder that Michael Motto, a former admissions officer at Yale, once received an application from a highly impressive young woman, who thought it was smart to mention, in her application essay, that she once preferred to urinate on herself so as to not pull herself away from an intellectually stimulating discussion with her French teacher!
That’s not something one should admire, Motto notes. It’s something that needs to be properly treated.
Just like the entire US educational system.
Key Lessons from “Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be”

2.      Your University Doesn’t Define You: It’s What You Do There That Does
3.      Widen Your Horizons: Choose a College That Doesn’t Suit You
(but Sparks Your Curiosity)
The American Educational System Is Deeply Flawed and Biased
Every year the 
publishes a highly influential Best Colleges ranking. And every year prospective students eagerly await its publication so that it can help them in their decision which college to attend.
However, due to the rankings system being highly unscientific and subjective, and due to the fact that the admission process is demonstrably biased toward the rich, the white and the legacies, many students end up not only rejected but also depressed and directionless.
The point of an educational system, of course, is the very opposite.
Your University Doesn’t Define You: It’s What You Do There That Does
On the bright side, the CEOs of most Fortune 500 companies, many politicians and vice presidents, numerous Nobel Prize winners, and creative geniuses have never attended an Ivy League College. In other words, all of them have succeeded despite joining minor and relatively unimportant universities.
This shouldn’t surprise anyone because numerous studies have revealed that much more important than the university you choose is the way you spend your time there. Being deeply and actively involved in campus activity or group, for example, has been shown most decisively to be a significant factor in one’s happiness later in life.
So, don’t just dabble around in activities trying to fill out your resume. Join smartly. Connect. Experience being a part of something. 
.
Widen Your Horizons: Choose a College That Doesn’t Suit You (but Sparks Your Curiosity)
Speaking of happiness – the more diverse a university is, the more likely it should result in one’s contentment. College should be all about leaving your comfort zone and 
: elite schools, usually, achieve quite the opposite.
“College,” writes Bruni, “is a singular opportunity to rummage through and luxuriate in ideas, to give your brain a vigorous workout and your soul a thorough investigation, to realize how very large the world is and to contemplate your desired place in it.”
One more thing while we’re here. 
Believe it or not, according to a nationwide Gallup poll, only 9% of business leaders deem the ranking of your college a “very important” employment factor. 85%, on the other hand, think your field-relevant knowledge is the most important employment criterion.
Do you still think that not getting into an Ivy League College spells the end of your life?

To quote her at her motivational best:
Failure Is What Success Stories Are Built Upon: Jaclyn Johnson’s Story
“By the time I was thirty-two,” writes Jaclyn Johnson’s in the “Introduction” of 
,
“I had sold a company, launched a much-buzzed about new one, bought my first home, found the love of my life, and had a million ups and downs in between. How? By turning distrust into determination, frustration into fuel, and heartache into hard work.”
“Oh, yeah,” she adds instantly, “and that determination, fuel, and hard work? It can be so. much. fun.”
Even though born in the mid-1980s, Jaclyn Johnson has been a professional blogger/influencer for over a decade and a half. That’s right: she was using theoretical hashtags before real hashtags were invented, she was a blogger before blogs became a thing, she made money out of the internet in the (as she calls it) PE-world (the pre-exclamation, pre-emoji age).
“I had happened into a career in a little something called ‘social media’ five years before it would hit the mainstream,” she writes in the first chapter. “I was a boss at Blogspot, 
, I was posting on forums (I know, #LOL), and I had a blog.”
Even though having a blog doesn’t sound that remarkable nowadays, back in 2007 it was not only “a rare thing,” but also quite a chic-thing as well. The blog was called 
 and was a mix of “cut-out editorial collages… put together in PowerPoint,” trends Jaclyn was loving, places to eat, playlists, outfit inspirations. etc. etc. A sort of a LiveJournal of Johnson’s 20s, “an archive of inspiration, trends, and makers” she had her eye on.
Apparently, a lot of people were reading SNON (3,000 a day!) and it wasn’t that difficult for Johnson to get a job at Attention, now a preeminent global communications firm, but then just a start-up ahead of its time.
Johnson was employee #3 and was responsible for social media – you know, before anybody knew what that actually meant. In fact, at Attention, they called it “word-of-mouth marketing.” “Social media as we know and heart it today wasn’t really a thing,” remembers Johnson, “which means there was no snap, tag, or share yet. But there was Twitter, Facebook, blogging, and forums – all things I was familiar with and good at.”
“Influencers,” goes on Johnson, “if you don’t already know, (mainly) started as bloggers – the girls taking outfit of the day (#OUTD) photos, DIYers, and the like – who turned their blogs into bona fide businesses… We – the influencers – had immediately seen the potential in this digital world. And because I understood the world from both the blogging end and the marketing end, I knew I was capable.”
And, indeed, Johnson 
capable, so soon enough she was poached by a company larger than Attention, IAC (an acronym for InterActiveCorp), and tasked with leading their “social media” efforts across multiple businesses – but mainly their startup Pronto (a now-defunct Amazon competitor).
And, boy, what an upgrade this was: the job, Johnson tells us, “came with a director title, a six-figure salary… an unlimited snack section and a built-in espresso bar.” And it was in New York, New York. Life couldn’t be better, right?
Well, it was so… for some time.
But then the dot-com bubble burst and the 
 hit. Everybody around Johnson started losing their job and when one day she was called in for a meeting with the IAC’s CEO, she knew she was getting the ax. 
Surprisingly she was wrong: she was instead offered a new job at a sister company called CitySearch (“think Yelp’s older, unrulier brother”). Even though this meant traveling across state to LA, Johnson accepted the job.
However, a female executive at CitySearch didn’t like what she was doing; in fact, in a way, she didn’t like the fact that the world in which she excelled was changing. Long story short, due to the female executive’s preference for older soon-to-be-completely-out-of-date marketing methods (and her dislike of Johnson’s no-nonsense, in-yer-face and “aggressive” emails) fired Jaclyn.
Still upbeat, Johnson tried to turn this closed door into an open window and at an age where most of us are still finding our way through college, she launched a promising company with a trusted business partner. Everything was going great until she discovered that her business partner (it’s a 
 once again) had made some “detrimental decisions” for the company without her knowledge.
A “brutal business breakup” followed – the second massive blow in a fairly short time. 
Johnson was 24… and unwilling to give up.
In the next eight years, she managed to sell the company, build a new (and even more successful) one, and add another digit to the six-figure salary of her IAC days. And she enjoyed every single minute of that!
How to WorkParty: Jaclyn Johnson’s Guidebook
How, you ask?
Well, by being aware that the “work hard” interpretation of the American Dream she was raised on can be modified to suit better the feelings of our age. As she writes:
However, Jaclyn Johnson wants you to know from the outset that she’s not the Wolf of Wall Street or Toni Robbins and that neither her office is filled “with streamers and champagne” nor she has some grand theory of life that she wants to impart on her followers through WorkParty.
She just wants to share the lessons she learned and the advice she wishes she’d gotten when she was:
• 21 and at her first major job;
• 24, “bright-eyed and a bit naïve,” launching her first business company with a partner;
• 28, and “striking out” on her own;
• or even 30, “having created and cultivated a community of over five hundred thousand women.”
And here are some of these lessons:
• 
. Make your goal to become the person your colleagues recommend when they go to work at another company: especially at the start of your career, cultivating relationships with your colleagues makes all the difference.
• 
. Being nice to people and contacting them from time to time always pays off: it’s not only a career-builder but also a career-keeper – even when you make it. 
• 
. Misunderstandings are often the result of 
 talking. And money misunderstandings are the worst. So, talk about money with your business partners openly and candidly before venturing into something bigger.
• 
. Handshakes don’t matter: an agreement is an agreement only when put on paper and notarized. If the court says so, you should as well.
• 
. Treat everything as a real business – even if it looks like a creative sideline at the beginning. Who knows what that might grow into in the end?
The Ten Basic Rules for Pitching Your Business
Knowing how to pitch your business to a potential client is not exactly something one is born with. Johnson offers ten pieces of advice on how to develop this all-important skill:
#1. Start with writing down and 
 that talk about what your company does.
#2. Look for 
 with the people who are in the room before making the pitch to them.
#3. Understand your 
 and prepare for market-related questions.
#4. Never forget to define how your company is 
 from the others, and, thus, can 
 fill a certain “
,” i.e., the place “where unmet and unarticulated needs are uncovered to create innovation opportunities.
#5. 
: stats, campaign, analyses.
#6. “
:” change the topic if you notice the attention of your listeners waning.
#7. If you’re seated, 
and demonstrate your presence.
#8. Include 
and
from past clients.
#9. Say your 
 out loud and without hesitation.
#10. If you’re making the pitch with colleagues, 
: contradicting your colleagues is one of the worst things you can do during pitching.
The Six Types of Employees Your Company Needs (and How to Hire Them)
According to Jaclyn Johnson, there are six types of employees every start-up needs to succeed: 
#1. 
 
: usually and preferably the CEO, this is the individual who sees both the big picture and the tiny essentials and moves rapidly toward success, with purpose and determination.
#2. 
: this one is the individual who brings experience from other areas and who is organized and quick-witted enough to solve most problems that inevitably come along the way.
#3. 
: the social connector, the energy provider, the one everybody loves for who he is, i.e., the hard worker who does everything with a smile and while caring for his colleagues.
#4. 
: the one who 
a suck-up to the boss and who is willing to say everything to their face, even if it’s unpleasant.
#5. 
 
: the one who prefers to help their colleagues than get credit for his work.
#6. 
: the one who doesn’t wait for permission to do something they feel right – even if that means regretting afterward.
If you want to gather your all-star team, these few tips & tricks will definitely help you:
• Advertise the job with common, searchable words, rather than using unique and catchy titles.
• Hire only someone who sees your company as a good fit for him – and not 
if it’s the other way around.
• Speaking of good fit: don’t hire someone who doesn’t know that much about the industry your company is in.
• Find someone who laughs and seems positive under pressure.
• Be honest with your new hires regarding everything, including possible pay rises and potential for upward mobility.
• After the interview, ask yourself whether you could spend a few hours stranded with your new hire in an airport.
• While on the topic, don’t hire your friends: statistically, instead of contributing to the perfect work environment, this only leads to problems and difficulties.
• Set up a three-month trial period and at least one in-depth review after a year for your new hire.
• If things don’t work out after the first or second milestone, don’t give your new hire a second chance: fire them before it becomes even more complicated to do so.
Key Lessons from “WorkParty”
1.      The New American Dream
2.      It’s a Man’s World – and Women Should Do Something About It
3.      There Are More Than One Possible Path to Greatness
The New American Dream
You know what the old American dream is all about: work hard and inevitably success will come.
However, as Johnson learned the hard way, there’s also nepotism, political preference and all kinds of things that hard work cannot overcome that easily.
So, she offers an alternative to the old vision of the American dream: the WorkParty version.
WorkParty means nothing more but working hard and with passion. That way, even if it doesn’t work out in the end, you’ll have no regrets – because you’ll have enjoyed every single minute of your failure. And in that case, it’s not really a failure, is it?
It’s a Man’s World – and Women Should Do Something About It
Unfortunately, gender bias is a real thing – and it’s something that has kept women out of the workplace for centuries. And even today, when there are so many successful women around, women don’t advance in their careers because of gender bias.
In Jaclyn Johnson’s experience, there’s an even worse side to this bad side of the coin: sometimes, a woman’s success is hampered not only by men but also by other women. “Behind every great woman are great women,” she writes suggesting that women should really do something about this because they need to help each other and not get in each other’s ways.
So, consequently, there are two things women need to do to add a W and an O before the syntagma “man’s world”: 1. to stop feeling the paralyzing imposter syndrome; 2. to turn to inspiring and successful women as their role models; 3. to discuss their experiences and be there for each other as often as possible – there are more men than women at leading positions, so if they don’t stand for each other, they will be quickly overridden.
There Is More Than One Possible Path to Greatness
“No truly successful entrepreneur these days has followed some preordained path to success,” writes Jaclyn Johnson. “There is no ‘right.’ There’s only saying yes, figuring it out, and knowing there will only be a few bumps along the way.”

“The Power of Moments PDF Summary”
Why do we remember certain experiences and forget others? Moreover, why do some of the experiences we remember are so meaningful to us? How is it possible that a single, somewhat unimportant event—such as noticing someone you love in a crowd two hours after getting the boot at work—can turn an unbearable day into one of the most outstanding days of our life?
These are all questions the Heath brothers try to answer in their newest book, 
. Contrary to popular belief, they don’t think that most of the defining moments of our lives just happen to us as in the example above.
True, many of them are “product of fate or luck or maybe a higher power’s interventions,” but the majority are controllable and “no less special for having been planned.”
“Defining moments shape our lives,” the Heath brothers write, “but we don’t have to wait for them to happen. We can be the authors of them. What if a teacher could design a lesson that students were still reflecting on years later? What if a manager knew exactly how to turn an employee’s moment of failure into a moment of growth? What if you had a better sense of how to create lasting memories for your kids?”
tries to make this possible. Its objectives are twofold: 
• It examines defining moments and “identifies the traits they have in common,” trying to answer the question “what, specifically, makes a particular experience memorable and meaningful?”; and
• It shows how 
 can create defining moments by making use of these traits so that you can make memories, enrich your life, connect with others or improve the experience of customers, employees or even patients.
So much for the intro. Now, onto our summary!
The Peak-End Rule of Defining Moments
Let’s start our discussion of memorable and defining moments in a rather unconventional manner: with a psychological experiment that asked participants to undergo three painful trials.
In the first, the somewhat sadistic researchers submerged their participants’ hands for 1 minute in buckets filled with frigid, 57-degree (13 Celsius) water. The second trial was similar—but with a catch: after having their hands submerged for 60 seconds in the 57-degree water, the participants had to keep them for 30 seconds more; the only difference was that during these thirty seconds the water warmed up to 59 degrees (15 Celsius). 
Now, for their third painful experience, the participants were given a choice: Would you rather repeat the first trial or the second?
To the reader of this summary, this might seem like an easy question. After all, both trials featured 1 minute of identical pain, and the second trial 
another half a minute of 
So, write the Heaths, “this is kind of like asking: would you rather be slapped in the face for 60 seconds or 90?”
Even so, two-thirds of the participants chose the longer trial.
How so?
Well, for one, because when we assess an experience, we tend to forget its length, something psychologists refer to as “the duration neglect.” Bear in mind that though the researchers in our experiment above measured the time carefully, the participants were never told how much time had elapsed at no point during the experiment. 
The second reason, however, is much more interesting: almost without an expectation, we rate our experiences based on two key moments: 1) the best or worst moment, known as the “peak”; and 2) the ending. 
Psychologists call this the “peak-end rule,” and it is the reason why you think that 
is a great movie and Roger Ebert doesn’t share this opinion with you. The twist at the end of a movie, if well-written and structurally sound, makes you forget about all the plot holes or anything else you might have hated about the movie. Instead, it makes you think about the peak-moment and packs it up the whole experience in a defining moment.
Let’s be honest for a second here: not much of the plot of 
you can 
 recreate. And still, you rate that movie pretty highly. 
The reason for that is this peak-end rule of how we remember things: instead of playing out like an opera filled with constantly changing minute-by-minute sensations, our experiences are usually assessed in our brains via their flagship moments: the peaks, the pits, and the transitions.
And we can use that to our benefit.
Thinking in Moments
You see, as the Heath brothers write, “every culture has its prescribed set of big moments: birthdays and weddings and graduations, of course, but also holiday celebrations and funeral rites and political traditions.” Though they might seem “natural” to you, most of them are actually invented, “dreamed up by anonymous authors who wanted to give shape to time.”
This is what the Heaths mean by “thinking in moments,” process they define poetically as “recognizing where the prose of life needs punctuation.”
In their opinion—and according to their research—there are three situations that deserve such punctuation: transitions, milestones, and pits.
• 
. Transitions seem so natural
that they are almost always marked with some sort of “coming of age” rituals (both across cultures and across time). These “coming of age” rituals—be they bar mitzvahs or weddings—are sort of boundary markers, in that they try to pin down the gradual evolution of a human being into a few defining and memorable moments. Promotions, the first day of school and the end of projects are all transitional moments that should be marked: create defining moments for your kids, your loved ones and your employees by shaping a “coming of age” ritual around them.
• 
. Birthdays are the most obvious milestones, and the most obvious milestone-birthdays (believe it or not, this holds true for many cultures) are the 18
, the 21
, the 30
, 40
, 50
, 60
 and the 100
. Retirement and unheralded achievements (such as, say, a salesman’s 10 millionth dollar of revenue or the tenth promotion of the direct reports of a talented manager) are also milestones that should be marked. 
• 
Pits
are the opposite of peaks, i.e., negative defining moments, moments of hardship or pain or anxiety. It’s difficult to deal with negative feedback and almost impossible to overcome the loss of a loved one. Shouldn’t organizations be ready with a plan for these moments?
“Transitions should be marked, milestones commemorated, and pits filled,” write the Heaths. “That’s the essence of thinking in moments.”
However, to actually make these moments defining—i.e., memorable and meaningful—you need to know what memorable and meaningful moments are made of. Apparently, we’re talking about no more than four elements: the more of them you include in a certain experience, the more guaranteed you are to turn it into a defining moment.
Without further ado, here are the four elements.
Trait #1: Elevation
“Defining moments rise above the everyday,” write the Heaths. “They provoke not just transient happiness, like laughing at a friend’s joke, but memorable delight.”
To construct elevated moments, we must do three things: boost sensory pleasures, raise the stakes, and break the script.
 is all about “turning up the volume on reality. Things look better or taste better or sound better or feel better than they usually do.” This is why weddings have flowers and food and music and dancing, and why students remember extracurricular activities much more than they do lessons—even though they spend disproportionately more time in the classroom.
means “to add an element of productive pressure: a competition, a game, a performance, a deadline, a public commitment.” 
Finally, 
 means to add an element of surprise: it’s not only that surprises warp our perceptions of time (the less expected the information to your brain the longer the experiences last—quite literally), but they also keep the elevation afloat. 
Think about it this way: if you, as a CEO, decided to give away presents to your employees every Friday, you would have added only a few defining moments to their lives because, after the second or third repetition, they’ll start expecting it (it will become a part of the script). It will no longer be memorable—on the contrary, it will be a disappointing experience if it stops. 
 “Moments of elevation transcend the normal course of events; they are literally extraordinary,” conclude the Heaths. That’s why you have a bunch of them in your treasure chest in the form of love letters, ticket stubs, a well-worn T-shirt, or haphazardly colored cards from your kids that make you smile with delight.
Trait #2: Insight
“Defining moments rewire our understanding of ourselves or the world,” write the Heaths. “In a few seconds or minutes, we realize something that might influence our lives for decades.” For example, you will never forget the day you first thought things such as “this is the person I’m going to marry” or “now is the time to start a business.”
Modern writers (such as Proust or Joyce) deem these events “epiphanies,” and though it is very difficult to schedule them, it is not impossible. Two things help: making yourself (or others) trip over the truth or stretch for insight.
is a three-part recipe which turns explanations into experiences, and experiences into epiphanies. It starts with “a clear insight” that is then “compressed in time” so that it can finally be “discovered by the audience itself.” 
For example, in one “unforgettably disgusting story,” the Heaths explain how members of the WaterAid convinced some Bangladeshi villagers to use their new toilets (actually, latrines) instead of using the village’s outdoor spaces for defecation. 
They made the problem clear and compressed it in time by producing a map of the village and making every villager sprinkle a little yellow chalk on every place where someone had defecated during the last year. 
The “trip-over-the-truth” moment came when the CLTS (Community-Led Total Sanitation) facilitator asked the members of his audience to drink a glass of water, after swirling in it a hair from his head previously dipped in excrement.
Everyone refused, of course, but after being pointed out that flies pick up more excrement than a human hair, the community suddenly realized that for years, they have been eating each other’s excrement. And that was the epiphany, the “ignition moment” for change.
There’s another way to induce epiphanies: it’s called 
. In essence, this encompasses placing yourself in new situations that expose you to the risk of failure. It doesn’t matter whether you’ll succeed or not—the insight is guaranteed either way. “The promise of stretching is not success,” write the Heaths, “it’s learning.”
By the way, you have numerous insight-moments in your treasure chest: quotes or articles that moved you, books that changed your view of the world, diaries that captured your thoughts, etc. etc. 
Trait #3: Pride
Defining moments capture us at our best—moments of achievement, moments of courage, moments of pride. 
There are three practical principles to create more moments such as this: 1) Recognize others; 2) Multiply meaningful milestones; 3) Practice courage. As the Heaths say, “the first principle creates defining moments for others; the latter two allow us to create defining moments for ourselves.”
is self-explanatory, and yet, we dramatically underinvest in recognition. For example, even though 4 out of 5 supervisors say they frequently express appreciation for their workers, just 1 of 5 employees agrees.
It’s important to note that effective recognition is personal, not programmatic: “Employee of the Month” awards, for example, are part of the script that needs to be broken. “Tailored rewards” make all the difference—as anyone who has ever gotten the birthday gift they wanted knows full well.
“Recognition is characterized by a disjunction,” say the Heaths. “A small investment of effort yields a huge reward for the recipient.” For example, the life of a middle-school student can be irretrievably changed by a caring music teacher who doesn’t shy away from telling her that her voice is beautiful. (True story, by the way, one of the many that appear on the pages of 
).
Turning to yourself, 
is one of the best strategies to create more defining moments of pride in your life. Reframing the marathon that is your life in a lane featuring many “finish lines” is what makes life worthwhile. Imagine if your life consisted of Mondays only; now, imagine if it features three-day workweeks. Strive for the latter!
Finally, 
also results in memorable and meaningful moments of pride. Moreover, courage is contagious: your defining moment of courage can be a defining moment for someone else as well.
The fact that moments of pride are defining moments of life can be proven by the contents of your treasure chest: ribbons, report cards, notes of recognition, certificates, thank-yous, awards… Why haven’t you thrown them out? “It just hurts, irrationally, to throw away a trophy,” write the Heaths.
Trait #4: Connection
“Defining moments are social: weddings, graduations, baptisms, vacations, work triumphs, bar and bat mitzvahs, speeches, sporting events. These moments are strengthened because we share them with others… Moments of connection bond us with others. We feel warmth, unity, empathy, validation,” write the Heaths.
To spark moments of connection for groups, one must 
. That can be accomplished by three strategies: (1) creating a synchronized moment; (2) inviting shared struggle; and (3) connecting to meaning. Think of church congregations or just-cause protests as two good examples. Remember 
? Even we, as viewers, feel the need to join in.
“Groups bond when they struggle together,” write the Heaths. “People will welcome a struggle when it’s their choice to participate, when they’re given autonomy to work, and when the mission is meaningful.” Think of all the AA meetings: sharing experiences of pain and sadness is one of the best “social technologies to bind in-groups together.”
Connection is also about 
. And according to a psychologist named Harry Reis, what deepens individual relationships is “responsiveness.” Responsiveness, in turn, consists of three things: mutual understanding, validation, and caring.
Check your treasure chest. All those wedding photos, vacation photos, family photos, “Christmas photos of hideous sweaters,” photos, photos, photos… are probably the first thing you’d grab if your house caught on fire, right?
Key Lessons from “The Power of Moments”
1.      Defining Moments (and the Peak-End Rule)
2.      The Secret of Thinking in Moments
3.      The Four Elements Defining Moments Are Made Of
Defining Moments (and the Peak-End Rule)
Even though it might seem a bit counter-intuitive, most people tend to assess their experiences based on two key moments: 1) the best or the worst moment (the peak), and 2) the ending of the experience. That’s why, even if a film is great for two hours, you’ll give it a 3-star rating if it doesn’t nail its ending. 
In other words, as memorable and meaningful as they are (by definition), the defining moments of your life can be hacked: you just need to focus on their peak and their ending.
The Secret of Thinking in Moments
There are numerous defining moments in an average human’s life, but according to the Heath brothers, they can all be categorized into three classes: 
• 
: coming-of-age moments, such as the first day of school or a promotion
• 
: birthdays or retirements
• 
: negative defining moments, such as the loss of a loved one
If you want to make one’s experience better, focus on these three types of moments—“transitions should be marked, milestones commemorated, and pits filled”—and you will.
The Four Elements Defining Moments Are Made Of
All defining moments consist of one or more of these four elements:
• 
: they rise above the everyday
• 
: they rewrite our understanding of the world
• 
: they capture us at our best
• 
: they are social

 is one of those books that are bound to touch you in one way or another: a marvelously written 
, it feels both as a children’s book and a serious exploration of beauty, obsession, and lost causes.
We recommend it to anyone who loves to read—and especially to those who prefer long books to movies, and haunting prose to special effects.
Donna Tartt Biography
 is an American writer.
Included in TIME magazine’s “100 Most Influential People” list in 2014, Tartt has authored only three novels, each of them lauded by critics and general readers alike: 
, 
, and 
Tartt won the WH Smith Literary Award for 
and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for 
 
. In addition, her short story “The Ambush” was included in the anthology 
 
.
Plot
 is a coming-of-age tale told in retrospective first-person narration by its main protagonist, 
. At 800 pages, it touches upon so many subjects that no summary of its story will ever do the book any justice.
And this is even less true than in the cases of some other “unsummarizable” books we’ve shared with you so far because 
is written in an exceptionally beautiful and hauntingly inspiring prose. You’ll understand what we have in mind, once you read the few excerpted parts below, especially the paragraph which concludes the novel.
Though, just like Theodore, the book’s story constantly skips between places, it revolves around the whereabouts of an exceptional painting by Rembrandt’s most gifted student, Carel Fabritius. Unsurprisingly, the painting is also titled “The Goldfinch” and, if you like, you can see it, in all its mysterious majesty and timeless beauty, by clicking 
.
Also, if you want to, you can click “Play” on the video below and watch the trailer of the very recent adaptation of Donna Tartt’s novel—which, we regret to say, does the book even less justice than our summary.
The Dividing Mark
Theodore “Theo” Decker is merely a 13-year-old boy when his mother takes him to the New York City’s Metropolitan Museum of Art on an exhibition of Dutch masterpieces so that she can view her favorite painting: Fabritius’ “The Goldfinch.” 
Little does Theo’s mother know that this would be the last day of her life. And only years later would Theo understand that this would be the day which would irretrievably alter his life.
As the lines above anticipate (or rather reveal), during the visit of the museum, Theo’s mother, just like several other visitors, is killed—the result of a bomb attack by a right-wing home-grown extremist group.
In the rubble, half-present due to the experienced trauma, Theo notices “The Goldfinch” and takes it with him. 
In a way, as we are about to learn, the event is much more than just a simple theft. It is one of the main symbolic transactions of the story, for, by the end of the book, it is fairly evident that the painting has taken the place of Theo’s lost mother.
The Old Man, the Red-Haired Girl, and the Barbours
Even before the bomb attack in the museum, Theo’s attention is attracted by a beautiful red-haired girl walking with an elderly gentleman. 
During the immediate aftermath of the wreckage, Theo happens upon this man, by that time already dying from severe wounds.
The man gives Theo a ring and, with his dying breath, instructs him to go to Hobart and Blackwell and ring a green bell there. Theo takes the ring and promises to do so.
Since Theo’s father, 
, is anything but a father, social services try to place Theo in another home. However, Theo has a better idea: he asks them to move with a school friend of his, 
,
whose family is extremely rich.
And so he does, taking “The Goldfinch” with him.
At the Barbours—who live in a large apartment at Park Avenue—Theo tries to adjust to his new life. However, the best thing he can do for a while is, expectedly, to grieve. Fortunately, due to the low lighting and its vastness, the Barbours’ apartment is at least a great place for that.
However, it is not a great place to hide in, since 
 regularly uses it to host charity events, so Theo feels as if he is on display together with the antique furniture. On top of that, Theo also has to regularly deal with Andy’s two younger siblings, 
 and 
, who resent his presence because they feel their parents are more concerned about him than them.
While at the Barbours, Theo remembers the ring and the instructions from the old man at the Metropolitan, so he decides to carry out his last wishes. 
He rings the green bell at Hobart and Blackwell and, there, he learns that the man who gave him the ring was none other than one of the two owners: 
. He forms a connection with the other one,
, and is more than happy to see the red-haired girl at the antique shop once again.
He learns that her name is 
 and that she has lived with Welty and Hobie ever since her mother (Welty’s half-sister) had died of cancer several years back.
In addition, he becomes pretty aware that he has some strange, but rather deep, feelings for this girl who is soon after sent to live with blood relatives.
The Return of the Prodigal Father and the Appearance of Boris
Just as the Barbours ready to adopt Theo, his father, together with his girlfriend, 
, resurfaces from absolutely nowhere and decides to take him to Las Vegas; Theo has no choice but to follow him, taking “The Goldfinch” with him.
In Las Vegas, things are looking bleak until, one day, Theo accidentally meets (at a crowded bus stop) a dark-haired boy who grows to become his best friend, 
. 
As you can easily deduce from his name, Boris is not an American: he is the son of Ukrainian émigrés and has lived all around the world before arriving in America: Scotland, Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Sweden.
Boris is similar to Theo in more than one way. His mother (his father’s second wife) has been dead for a while, and he too has been raised by an alcoholic father who severely beats him from time to time. 
The two spend most of their afternoons drinking, smoking marijuana, and experimenting with all kinds of drugs—each of these activities either a way out of the unbearable present or a step down the ladder of self-destruction.
Speaking of self-destruction, Theo’s father gets drunk one day and dies in a car accident, leaving Theo an orphan with neither a plan or a vision for his own future.
Scamming in New York City
Left alone and faced with the possibility of being placed in foster care, Theo steals some money from Larry’s girlfriend, takes her dog and heads off to New York City.
After wandering the streets of the Big Apple, he eventually arrives at the doorstep of Hobart and Blackwell, where he is welcomed by Hobie and spends some time with Pippa, visiting on break from her school for troubled teens, located in Switzerland. 
The narrative next skips eight years, and we see Theo well versed in the antique trade. So much so that, in the meantime—as we soon find out—he has managed to become Hobie’s business partner. He is also engaged to none other than 
, whom he has started to date after the death of Andy and his father due to a sailing accident.
The engagement aside, Theo is actually still in love with Pippa, and Kitsey has an affair with one of Theo’s most despised classmates: 
. They both find out about each other’s feelings but decide to remain engaged—for convenience.
Even though Hobie loves him very much and believes him unconditionally, Theo—now addicted to prescription medication—has been using the antique shop as the hub for a business scam, selling restored antiques as valuable originals.
True, this has saved Hobie from bankruptcy, but it has also betrayed his trust—which is why Theo is racked by guilt. He is also racked by fear because “The Goldfinch” is still with him, and he learns that a group of people who, during the museum bombing, stole treasured artwork, has now been found and arrested.
Concerned about himself but almost as much about Hobie and Pippa, Theo hides the painting in a rented storage locker. Somehow, one of the victims of his scam, a guy named 
, has put two and two together and tries to blackmail Theo by threatening to tell the police that Theo is using “The Goldfinch” for criminal activities. 
Correctly believing this to be a bluff, Theo dismisses Reeve and his claims.
The Returns of the Prodigal Friend
Soon after, Theo runs into Boris on the streets of New York. Due to dubious and unnamed activities, Boris is now a wealthy man with a developed network of collaborates.
To his astonishment, Theo learns from Boris that Lucius Reeve was partly right: “The Goldfinch” has been used as collateral by him and other drug dealers for the past few years.
How is that possible, you wonder?
Simple: Boris stole “The Goldfinch” from Theo back in Las Vegas and left a high school textbook in its place. In disbelief, Theo checks the storage unit only to discover the veracity of Boris’ words. 
Feeling guilty, Boris devotes himself to recovering the painting, and, at Theo’s engagement party, he comes with a plan to reclaim “The Goldfinch.”
Soon after, the two fly to Amsterdam where they meet the dealers who have the painting. Boris and his associates do manage to steal the painting, but, at the last moment, they are confronted by armed henchmen.
In the ensuing conflict, one of the dealers escapes with the painting, Boris is shot in the arm by the other, who is, in turn, killed by the confused and fearful Theo. Boris sends Theo to an Amsterdam hotel, and Theo remains there for weeks, drinking and taking drugs on a daily basis.
Since he doesn’t have his passport and has just committed murder, he is afraid to leave his room, let alone the hotel. He even contemplates suicide, but before he can enact his plan, Boris reappears yet again, carrying with him a great deal of money with Theo’s name on them.
Its source?
Well, believe it or not, it is half of the reward he has collected from the police for informing on the dealers. Even better, this act has resulted in the police recovering “The Goldfinch” and returning it to the museum. 
The Goldfinch Epilogue
Feeling as if he has already lived through several lives, Theo returns to New York City, only to be confronted by Hobie, who has learned from Lucius all about Theo’s business scam. Theo has a plan to make amends: to use the reward money to buy back the fake antiques and restore the business’ honor.
And that’s it—that’s how the novel ends. Just like in life, everything is left open-ended. Though Hobie remains close to Theo despite the betrayal, Pippa leaves and is forever lost: even though she loves him, she assures Theo that she could never be romantically involved with him.
“I feel I have something very serious and urgent to say to you, my non-existent reader, and I feel I should say it as urgently as if I were standing in the room with you,” Theo speaks to us at the end of his confession, before sharing a few rather bleak lessons.
“That life—whatever else it is—is short. That fate is cruel but maybe not random. That Nature (meaning Death) always wins but that doesn’t mean we have to bow and grovel to it. That maybe even if we’re not always so glad to be here, it’s our task to immerse ourselves anyway: wade straight through it, right through the cesspool, while keeping eyes and hearts open.”
And he goes on, so memorably:

“The Goldfinch PDF Quotes”
Our Critical Review
has to be one of the most polarizing novels published in the last decade or so. Deemed “marvelous” and “Dickensian” by some, it was also criticized as “juvenile” by others, prompting “a full-on debate in which the naysayers believe that nothing less is at stake than the future of reading itself.” (
)
Be that as it may, it’s difficult to say that 
is “forgettable” or even “putdownable.” Beautifully written, we guarantee you that it will take you by the hand and lead you on a journey of truths and pains—one which will leave you exhausted and happy and yearning and, why not, even dissatisfied at the end.

Ready for another true crime story? How about the original one?
If so, you’re in luck—today, we have for you the summary of Truman Capote’s most celebrated and genre-defining book:
Who Should Read “In Cold Blood”? And Why?
If you like true crime books such as John Grisham’s 
, Michelle McNamara’s 
, or Bryan Stevenson’s 
, then 
should be the next book on your reading list.
It is not only the first major true crime book—it is also, by many accounts, the best one, both in terms of style and influence.
Truman Capote Biography
 was an American writer, screenwriter, and actor.
After discovering his calling as a writer at the age of 8, he spent most of his teenage years perfecting his writing abilities. At 19, he had already penned one of the most celebrated short stories of the 20
 century, “Miriam,” and soon after he got his first book deal.
Two years later he published 
, his first novel, which, together with the novella 
and 
is considered a literary classic.
Many of Capote’s works have been adapted for the screen, several more than once.
Plot
Widely considered the best non-fiction novel ever written—and so highly regarded that it is sometimes incorrectly assumed to be the original one (though it is certainly the first major non-fiction novel, it has a few predecessors)—Truman Capote’s 
is a book that defies categorization and transcends genres.
First published in 1966, it novelizes the 1959 quadruple murder of the Clutter family by Richard “Dick” Hickock and Perry Smith but does so with such rigorous attention to detail and veracity that it is difficult to say which parts of it are fictional and why.
It took Truman Capote six years to investigate the story—which he did in the company of his good friend, 
—and the writing process exhausted him so much that he never finished another book until the end of his life, 18 years later!
Since it is based on a true crime independent of the way the book tells it, there are numerous ways to summarize the story, but we decided to be faithful to Capote’s non-fiction novel.
Chapter I: The Last to See Them Alive
The book begins on November 14, 1959, the last day on earth for four members of the Clutter family: the patriarch, 
, his wife 
, and their two teenage children, 
 (16) and 
 (15).
Truman Capote uses the first chapter of 
to set the stage for their impending murder in an almost cinematic manner, switching back and forth between the ordinary happenings in the Clutter family and the planning of their murder by 
 and 
—two recently paroled ex-convicts—who are driving in their direction.
So, while Smith and Hickock are driving around, buying rope and rubber gloves, and discussing whether to buy stockings as well, the members of the Clutter family are going about their day as if it is just an ordinary day.
Herb, a well-respected, church-going and prosperous farmer adored by the community, wakes up early and eats his breakfast before going out on the farm to conduct his daily farm chores.
His daughter Nancy talks to Susan, a friend of hers, on the phone about a boy she’s been dating named 
, and, later on, teaches another friend named 
how to make a cherry pie.
Meanwhile, Kenyon—ever interested in manufacturing things and fixing cars—is making a hope chest for his sister in the basement recreational room.
At about this time, an insurance salesman arrives and starts a discussion with Herb. He is later seen leaving the premise immensely satisfied, having made a hefty deal for a life insurance policy with Herb.
As Dick and Smith are nearing ever more to the farm of the Clutters, they are visited by Bobby, Nancy’s boyfriend, who has dinner with the family. After watching some TV with them later on, he leaves at about 11 PM.
Capote cuts the story here and transfers us to the next morning, when 
, a friend of Nancy Clutter, arrives at the house for a visit. No one answers her knocks and calls, so she asks the housekeeper where are the Clutters.
Since he is all but sure that they are home, he goes with her to investigate. The two eventually go inside the house only to reveal the four lifeless bodies of the Clutter family scattered around the floor.
The peaceful town of Holcomb, Kansas is shaken to its very foundation upon hearing the news. People begin to meet and gossip (mostly at Hartman’s Café), discussing possible suspects and most of them fearing that the murderer is probably somebody they know.
The real murderers have, of course, fled the town. Perry has spent the night in a hotel, and Dick with his family in Oklahoma, to whom he tells that that he has come straight from a visit of Perry’s sister in Fort Scott—the reason for his journey.
Chapter II: Persons Unknown
The Kansas state police (or KBI for short) begins its investigation, with detective 
acting as the leader. Though there are not many leads, Dewey suspects that the murder is done by more than one killer; however, he is unable to find a motive, since almost nothing is missing from the house.
Meanwhile, in Olathe, a town of Oklahoma, Perry and Dick sit in a diner. Though both of them are starving, Perry is unable to eat, crippled by fear that they will be found. Even so, he still has enough strength to bully Dick into admitting that they killed a whole family on a piece of incorrect information.
Namely, they expected to find a treasure inside the home of the Clutter family, and they left with nothing more than a pair of binoculars, a small portable radio and about $50 dollars in cash.
As Dewey is following tips from overly concerned citizens back in Holcomb, Perry and Dick head off to Mexico City, where they befriend a German tourist named Otto and where Perry confesses to Dick that he had never killed a man before, despite telling him the opposite.
However, they have to leave Mexico soon after due to their inability to go on paying their hotel bills—which they have been paying with bad checks anyhow.
After their return to America, an old letter sent by his father, 
, to his parole officers, incites a stream of memories in the head of Perry, and Capote uses this moment to give us a sketch of Perry’s previous life.
We learn that his parents divorced when he was a child and that he spent most of his early years being raised by his alcoholic mother. He even tried to run away from her once, but he was turned away by his father once he got to him.
Eventually, after his mother died from choking on her own vomit, Perry and his siblings were sent to a Catholic orphanage, where, supposedly, he was repeatedly beaten by the nuns for his bed wetting habit.
At 16, Perry joined the United States Merchant Marines, and in 1948, he joined the Army as well. He served in the Korean War and received an honorable discharge four years later. Soon after he bought a motorcycle and nearly died after losing control of it due to adverse weather conditions.
He spent six months in the hospital after this accident, recovering only to a certain extent: due to the severity of the injuries, he would go on suffering chronic leg pain until the end of his life. As a consequence, he also grew to become a painkiller addict.
Back in Holcomb, Dewey is unable to find any kind of lead to help him, and the town grows increasingly impatient with the fact that nobody is arrested even after so many weeks.
Chapter III: The Answer
Relaxing in his cell, a prisoner by the name of 
hears the news over the radio of the murders of the Clutter family. Even though he can guess the identity of one of the murderers right away, it is only weeks after this event that he decides to contact the police.
How does he know anything about the murder even with being in his jail cell all this time?
Well, because it was he who gave the incorrect information to his former cellmate Hickock that Herbert Clutter—for whom Floyd Wells has worked in the past—has a $10,000 fortune lying around at his house! Moreover, he has heard Hickock talking about his plans to rob the Clutter family—he never bothered to stop or correct him!
The KBI knows right away that this is a strong lead. So, 
, a KBI agent starts following it, heading straight to Hickock’s home in Oklahoma, where he learns about his supposed visit of Perry’s sister on the night of the murder.
And that’s where he heads next. As expected, in San Francisco, Perry’s sister Barbara reveals to him that she has seen neither her brother nor Dick for a long, long time.
In the meantime, in a pretty dumb move, Dick and Perry return to Kansas to exchange some bad checks for money, and Dick even uses his own name to sign them. This doesn’t escape the police and Harold Nye phones Al Dewey with the info. However, the two escape before Dewey can get to them and travel to Miami.
On December 30
, 1959, Dewey finally receives a long-awaited phone call: Dick and Perry have been arrested in Las Vegas. He, Nye, and two other KBI agents immediately head there to question the suspects. Despite the fact that they are being questioned by the Kansas police, the murderers are not worried: they are sure that they have been arrested for passing bad checks.
However, after some time, in two different rooms, both Perry and Dick are faced with the real reason for their capture. Though both of them deny any involvement in the murders, Nye and Dewey notice that they look shaken.
The very next day, Dick cracks and admits everything, repeatedly claiming that it was Perry who had killed all four Clutters. After realizing that Dick has already confessed, Perry tells a different story, claiming that the women were shot by Dick.
Chapter IV: The Corner
Perry and Dick are kept in the Garden City jail where they are asked by a psychologist to write autobiographies chronicling their youth. Perry takes the assignment seriously, but Dick is much more casual and disinterested.
Possibly because he is planning to escape using a shiv which he has created from a brush. However, as his diary reveals, this shiv is later discovered by the sheriff which kills some of Dick’s hope. Perry’s hope is expressed in the form of fantasies of someone saving him unexpectedly, but, deep down inside, he knows that this will never happen.
Soon after, the trial begins, and Floyd Wells testifies and corroborates the state’s case. Dewey does the same, describing in detail what happened on the night of the murders. It is too gruesome and brutal to be summarized here, but let’s just say that it involves everything: binding, gagging, a slit throat and four .12-gauge shotgun shots.
Unsurprisingly, Dewey’s description shocks everybody present, including the judge, who doesn’t allow a psychologist to testify in favor of Perry’s insanity. Had he allowed him, Capote says, the psychologist would probably have said something along these lines:
The verdict comes as no surprise to anyone: Perry and Dick are given the death sentence and sent to the death row section of Lansing Penitentiary. 
In Cold Blood Epilogue
At Lansing, Dick spends most of his time writing to different organizations for help, and Perry tries to starve himself to death until a letter from his father intervenes. Unlike Dick, Perry is passive, isolated, and even stranger than before. According to Dick, nobody likes Perry there—himself not excluded.
After several delays, five years after the first trial, Perry and Dick are finally executed on April 15
, 1965. Before being hanged, Dick shakes hands with four KBI officers and apologizes. Perry does the latter as well.
Dewey leaves the execution site feeling unsatisfied. He remembers running into Susan, Nancy’s friend, at the graveyard recently. Susan told him that Bobby Rupp has found a girl in the meantime and is now married. She also said she was doing well herself.
As Dewey says “Good luck” to her thinking how Nancy might have been just her kind of a young woman, the wind starts whispering through the grass of the graveyard.

“In Cold Blood PDF Quotes”
Our Critical Review
Truman Capote was already a nationwide celebrity even before 
, but after the publication of this book, he became a star in circles far beyond the literary ones.
An immediate sensation, the book was declared a “masterpiece” by many critics, and nobody has changed his mind to this very day.
“The book is neither a who-done-it nor a will-they-be-caught,” wrote Tom Wolfe in an essay the following year, “since the answers to both questions are known from the outset… Instead, the book’s suspense is based largely on a totally new idea in detective stories: the promise of gory details, and the withholding of them until the end.”
How’s that for originality, ha?"
Just Mercy Summary,https://blog.12min.com/just-mercy-pdf-summary/,https://blog.12min.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image2-1.jpg,"12 min read ⌚ 
In a March 2012 TED Talk, Bryan Stevenson—USA’s Mandela—reminded the world that, instead of believing everything is right with the world, 
 and start doing something about it. 
In retrospect, it sounds as if he was preparing the ground for the other, more important part of the story—the flip side of it, if you will.
Because 
, as both its title and subtitle suggest, is a story of justice and redemption.
And it’s one of the most important of its kind you’ll ever have the chance to read if you are an American!
Who Should Read “Just Mercy”? And Why?
is the book everyone who believes that the modern-day US-based version of Themis wears a blindfold should read straight away. Especially if he/she is a lawyer or judge.
It is also a book for those who know that America’s criminal justice system is flawed. Read it to not only see the extent of its unjust nature but also to detect the root cause.
About Bryan Stevenson
 is an American lawyer, social activist, and bestselling author.
A clinical professor at New York University School of Law, Stevenson is also the founder and executive director of Equal Justice Initiative, a non-profit organization which provides legal representation to marginalized prisoners who may have been wrongly convicted.

“Just Mercy PDF Summary”
Recently adapted into a touching and critically acclaimed legal drama starring Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx, 
,
for the most part of it, tells the story of Walter McMillian, a wrongfully convicted African-American pulpwood worker, whose controversial case received nationwide attention thanks to the efforts of none other than Bryan Stevenson.
However, though McMillian’s story is certainly its backbone, 
 the book offers much more than the movie of the same name. It not only contains profiles of many other similar cases, but it also highlights the serious faults of the American justice system and suggests how they can be mended.
In a way, it is a very unique coming-of-age story which follows, across more than two decades, the fight of an idealistic and gifted young lawyer against the Leviathan that is the American legal system, still deeply rooted in bias and prejudice, still favoring the wealthy and the powerful over the poor and the helpless.
There is a way out, suggests Stevenson, offering a ray of hope for those of us who’ve lost it—and, believe it or not, it’s both rational and humane one.

Bryan Stevenson, a Real-Life Modern-Day Atticus Finch
If you have an HBO subscription, allow us to make a recommendation: watch the documentary 
as soon as possible. 
As the movie’s subtitle says, it is a biography of Bryan Stevenson and it documents his decade-long fight for equality. As such, it makes 
even more intelligible and emotional.
In short, Stevenson was born to an underprivileged black family in “poor, rural, racially segregated settlement on the eastern shore of the Delmarva Peninsula, in Delaware.” Though this was just a little more than half a century ago, it was Delaware, and Stevenson had to deal with racism ever since his earliest years.
He studied at a “colored” elementary school and his life didn’t get better even after the formal desegregation: black children continued to play separated from white children, and they had to wait at the backdoor at the doctor’s or the dentist’s office!
Unsurprisingly, Stevenson grew up wondering how just it is for black and poor children to be treated as second-rate citizens: if anything, it should be the other way around, because they were powerless and they 
 help.
But he was never one of those who favored revenge over redemption—and he didn’t change this stance even after his maternal grandfather was stabbed to death when he was sixteen.
After graduating from Eastern University in St. Davids, Pennsylvania, Stevenson received a full scholarship to attend Harvard Law School, but his real career began while interning with the Southern Prisoners Defense Committee (SPDC).
Over the course of this internship, Stevenson has the privilege of meeting and befriending Henry, a young black man with a wife and kids, Bryan’s very first death row inmate acquaintance. 
The encounter has a transformative effect on Stevenson: he realizes that what he wants to do in life is to fight 
 the death penalty and 
 the reformation of America’s cruel and unjust prison system.
So as to achieve this, he moves to Atlanta to work for the SPDC. After some time, he moves yet again to Montgomery, Alabama, where, in 1989, he founded the Equal Justice Initiative—or EJI for short—an organization with a mission to “guarantee legal representation to every inmate on the state’s death row.”
Numbers Don’t Lie: The New Jim Crow
A year or so after moving to Atlanta, Stevenson was able to find (and afford) an apartment of his own. Since it was on a dense residential street, some nights he had to park halfway down the block (or even around the corner) to find a space.
However, one night, he got lucky and found a space just steps from his new front door. To make things even better, the radio was playing one of his favorite songs: “Hot Fun in the Summertime” by Sly and the Family Stone.
Bryan relaxed and decided to remain in the car for a couple of minutes and enjoy listening to the music. Not exactly, the perfect setting for the horror that followed: before Stevenson knew it, a SWAT team had surrounded his car, pointing guns at him and blaming him for a burglary.
They never apologized after letting him go. “You should be happy,” the older officer said to him, frowning. 
Believe it or not, the officer was right: Bryan was pretty fortunate 
 to be imprisoned for, well, doing nothing 
 being black. Because, as Michelle Alexander demonstrates in her exceptional and aptly-titled book, 
, most African-Americans usually 
and in quite similar situations
And this is not an exaggeration: based on the stats, 1 in 3 African-Americans born in the 21
 century will end up at least once in prison during his life!
Now, how is that possible?
Well, two reasons, and they can be summed up in three words: drugs, Reagan, and jurors.
You see, mass incarceration is a relatively new phenomenon, and it really hit off after 
. During and after his time, prison’s population rose significantly, mostly because of all the black people put there for smoking marijuana or something similar.
Though, statistically, white people use drugs at much the same rate, it was mainly the African-Americans who ended up being imprisoned because the jurors were (and still are) mostly white men—even in counties with majority black populations.
Why are so few black people jurors even though ever since 1880 it is unconstitutional to exclude jurors on the basis of race?
Well, because most of them have been convicted of some minor crime and, thus, are more often than not ineligible!
It’s a vicious circle and it spells out Injustice with a capital I!
The Story of Walter McMillian
contains numerous stories of wrongfully or harshly convicted people from all walks of life.
On its pages, you’ll come across a young mother serving a decade-long prison sentence for writing five checks—none more than $150—or across Charlie, a 14-year-old boy sentenced to life in prison for killing his mother’s abusive boyfriend.
However, by far the longest and most important story is that of Walter McMillian which is so fraught with the failings of the justice system that it almost reads like an allegory.
Unfortunately, it is a true story and yet another one about wrongfully convicted African-American man coming from a poor community in Monroeville, Alabama.
Though he had spent most of his childhood picking cotton, Walter managed to become a “moderately successful businessman” by the time he was 45. By this time, he was also a married man with children. 
However, in the community, he was best-known for the affair he had with Karen Kelly, a white woman, and for the fact that his son had married a white woman as well.
And then, on November 1, 1986, a beloved 18-year-old white dry-cleaning clerk by the name of Ronda Morrison was shot numerous times from behind by an unknown assailant.
At the time, Walter McMillian was at a church fish fry, but this didn’t matter to the newly elected and openly racist Sheriff Tom Tate, after Ralph Myers—an illiterate and mentally unstable friend of Karen Kelly—arbitrarily implicated McMillian (Karen’s “black boyfriend”) in this and another murder.
Even though it was obvious that “Walter McMillian had never met Ralph Myers, let alone committed two murders with him,” about half a year after the murder of Ronda Morrison, McMillian was arrested by Sheriff Tom Tate.
“There was no evidence against McMillian,” reminds us Stevenson, “no evidence except that he was an African American man involved in an adulterous interracial affair, which meant he was reckless and possibly dangerous, even if he had no prior criminal history and a good reputation. Maybe that was evidence enough.”
Well, even if that was evidence enough as far as the Sheriff was concerned, judges usually want a bit more to send a man to the death sentence.
Well, Tom Tate, the District Attorney, and several investigators took care of that: they bribed witnesses, they forced Ralph Myers to testify that McMillian was the murderer even after he had tried to recant, and systematically ignored evidence in favor of Walter.
There were many witnesses (all of them black) who swore, under oath, that at the time of the murder, McMillian was at the church fish fry, but an almost all-white jury (there was only one African American member) pronounced McMillian guilty and recommended a life sentence after a day and a half sham trial.
Why only that, said Judge Robert E. Lee Key, using the “unique Alabama practice” called “Judge Overrule” to override the jury and impose the death penalty.
After all—and this is where things get extraordinarily Kafkaesque—Walter McMillian had already been sent by the Judge to await trial on death row, even before the defense could present its case!
How do we know all of the above?
Because Bryan Stevenson and his newly-founded Equal Justice Initiative took on the case and started finding all kinds of dirt connected to it after Ralph Myers revealed to the McMillian’s trial counsel that he had given false testimony against Walter.
That was merely the beginning of the investigation. It would take years for Myers to officially recant the testimony, and the EJI to discover proofs of the bribery methods used by the State to convict Walter and the ways in which their racially motivated hatred had messed with the evidence.
After the case gained nationwide attention as part of the CBS program 
, new DA Tom Chapman launched his own investigation which confirmed EJI claims regarding Walter’s innocence.
Because of this, the EJI was in a good position to move for the state to drop all charges against McMillian and, after six years on the death row, Walter McMillian was finally released.
However, by this time, Walter had already changed and, despite the efforts of EJI to help him reenter society, he developed dementia and anxiety probably brought on to him by the trauma of imprisonment.
Walter McMillian died in 2013, on September 11.
The Quality of Mercy: “Above This Sceptred Sway”
At Walter’s funeral, Bryan Stevenson was one of the people asked to give a speech to the congregation. 
“I felt the need to explain to people what Walter had taught me,” informs us Stevenson in 
and goes on to list, so poignantly and so clearly, not all the things he said at Walter’s funeral, but, coincidentally, all the 
behind his book:
Walter had thought Bryan something even more beautiful and enduring: the quality of mercy. 
“Mercy is just when it is rooted in hopefulness and freely given,” writes Stevenson memorably, not only channeling but transcending his inner Portia. “Mercy is most empowering, liberating, and transformative when it is directed at the undeserving. The people who haven’t earned it, who haven’t even sought it, are the most meaningful recipients of our compassion.”
Remember that: just mercy belongs to the undeserving.
And it is the only thing strong enough to “break the cycle of victimization and victimhood, retribution and suffering. It has the power to heal the psychic harm and injuries that lead to aggression and violence, abuse of power, mass incarceration.”
Key Lessons from “Just Mercy”
1.      (Biased) Mass Incarceration Is a Serious (American) Problem
2.      Justice Is the Antonym of Poverty
3.      Each of Us is More Than the Worst Thing We’ve Ever Done
(Biased) Mass Incarceration Is a Serious (American) Problem
At present, there are 2.3 million people imprisoned in the USA, and thrice than that (about six million) on probation or on parole. That makes for a staggering number of more than 8 million criminals living on US soil, which basically means that if you know more than 40 people, you definitely know at least one criminal.
How does that compare to other countries?
Really, really bad!
With 737 prisoners per 100,000 people, the USA tops the prison rates charts, housing almost a million more prisoners than China, even though China’s population is about four times that of the US.
What’s worse and statistically improbable, a lot of these prisoners are African-Americans!
“One in every fifteen people born in the United States in 2001 is expected to go to jail or prison,” informs us Stevenson, “one in every three black male babies born in this century is expected to be incarcerated.”
Justice Is the Antonym of Poverty
And you know why there are so many imprisoned Americans, especially black?
Because most of them are marginalized in at least one other way, being either too poor or too young to find someone to defend them.
Stevenson writes:
Each of us is more than the worst thing we’ve ever done 
If you need to remember one thing from Bryan Stevenson’s excellent book, remember this: “Each of us is more than the worst thing we’ve ever done.”
That’s the vital lesson he learned working closely with death row inmates, most of them marginalized and frozen out from society.
Instead of punishing them twice, Stevenson argues, we need to offer them a second chance.
“Simply punishing the broken—walking away from them or hiding them from sight—only ensures that they remain broken and we do, too,” he concludes. “There is no wholeness outside of our reciprocal humanity.”

Have you ever heard that old adage “Jack of all trades, master of none”?
Well, David Epstein begs to differ. If you want to succeed in this wicked modern world of ours, he says, you need to have something much more than a certain specialty.
You need to have:
Who Should Read “Range”? And Why?
On the face of it, the time of polymaths is long gone: there are very few Da Vincis, Michelangelos, and Galileos around, and even fewer of them command the same respect these people did back in their own days.
However, the author of 
, David Epstein, believes the opposite: the ones who succeed are actually the ones who’ve refused to specialize and are able to see things from a broader perspective.
Regardless of what you think, read Epstein’s 
and face his arguments. Especially if you are young and/or clueless as to what your next career move should be. Perhaps, Epstein would argue, you’ve already made your life far easier—precisely by procrastinating and dabbling around.
Commenting upon this, Amanda Ripley, author of 
,
adds a few further recommendations: 
“I want to give 
to any kid who is being forced to take violin lessons—but really wants to learn the drums; to any programmer who secretly dreams of becoming a psychologist; to everyone who wants humans to thrive in an age of robots.”

“Range PDF Summary”
Even if you don’t know a lot about Malcolm Gladwell, you’ve probably already heard a lot about one concept he made quite popular in his third book, 
: the “10,000-Hour Rule.”
The basic idea behind it is quite simple: if you want to become an expert in something, you need about 10,000 hours of “deliberate practice.”
That’s how the Beatles became the Beatles, how Bill Gates became a computer whizz 
.
It doesn’t matter how old you are: what matters is the number of hours you have put into the discipline you want to excel at! 
Mozart, for example, started playing the piano from a very early age, and that is the main reason why he was considered a prodigy at the age of 6. In reality, however, by that age, he had already played the piano as many hours as most professionals manage well in their 20s, so, 
, he was much older than he actually was.
According to David Epstein, however, this is not the smartest way to go through life nowadays. Though he too believes that getting a head start and specializing in something works from time to time, most of the time, he says, it actually has 
 effects.
And, believe it or not, Malcolm Gladwell (of all people) seems to agree!
“For reasons I cannot explain,” he says, “David Epstein manages to make me thoroughly enjoy the experience of being told that everything I thought about something was wrong.
Yup, it’s time we make you question your old belief system once again, via the highlights from David Epstein’s marvelous 
!
A Story of Two Exceptional Boys
Just like Epstein, we’ll start our text with a couple of stories from the world of sports. It’s quite possible that you know them both—the first one much more than the second one.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention list “kicks a ball” and “stands on tiptoe” as physical developmental milestones for a 2-year-old child.
However, the child from our first story, at that very same age, was already able to use “a club tall enough to reach his shoulder to drive a ball past an admiring Bob Hope” on national TV! That same year, he entered his first tournament and won against children much older than him.
The very next year, this boy was capable of playing out of a “sand trap” and already boasted a score that many people (including the writer of this article) can only dream of: 48, 11 over par, for 9 holes at a course in California.
Only a few years later (at the age of 8), the boy beat his father for the first time, even though his father had been an outstanding athlete himself, playing baseball in college as the only black player in the entire conference.
The father didn’t mind: he was already aware that his son was “the Chosen One.” Not only he did have the talent, but he also had the father to guide him toward greatness.
The second story concerns a very different kind of boy. 
This one’s mother was a coach, but she never coached him. In fact, for all intents and purposes, he had a pretty regular childhood, playing everything from basketball and handball to soccer and table tennis. He also dabbled in skiing, swimming, wrestling, and skateboarding.
One day he discovered that he liked more sports that included a ball, and, nearing his teens, he started gravitating toward one particular kind of sport played with a ball: tennis. He still liked playing soccer, though, and by the time he had given up that sport as well, most of the other kids at his age had long since been working with strength coaches, sports psychologists, and nutritionists.
It didn’t matter in the long run: just like the kid from the first story, he too became the greatest.
In 2006, the boys whose stories we related to you above met for the first time and immediately connected. “I’ve never spoken with anybody who was so familiar with the feeling of being invincible,” boy #2 would later describe this encounter. 
However, he was aware of the differences between the two as well.
“His story is completely different from mine,” he added later on for a biographer. “Even as a kid, his goal was to break the record for winning the most majors. I was just dreaming of just once meeting Boris Becker or being able to play at Wimbledon some time.”
And, indeed—though the success of Boy #2 was all but inevitable considering his upbringing, it seems pretty unusual that Boy #2 was at least as dominant in his sport at the time of this meeting as Boy #1.
How did he do it? Was it against the odds? Or there’s something more to it?
Tiger vs Roger, aka Specialists vs Generalists
By now, you almost certainly know the identities of the two exceptional boys from the section above: Tiger Woods and Roger Federer. 
For David Epstein, they are much more than just household names, much more than dominant sportsmen, much more than the most dominant athletes of the 20
 century. Namely, they are symbols, real-life embodiments of two very different philosophies of life and two very different approaches toward education.
Tiger Woods is, of course, the Archetypal Specialist, the undeniable proof of the veracity of Gladwell’s 10,000-hours rule. He has “come to symbolize the idea that the quantity of deliberate practice determines success—and its corollary, that the practice must start as early as possible.”
Roger Federer, on the other hand, is the Typical Generalist. He chose to focus on tennis only after he was well into his teens. Unlike Tiger, thousands of kids had a head start on Roger, but, for some reason, none of them managed to become the #1 tennis player in the world.
No one would blame you for thinking that Roger’s story is the exception, but, believe it or not, it is Tiger’s! As Epstein writes:
For example, if you are a sports fan, you certainly know the name of Vasyl Lomachenko (the current #1 pound-for-pound boxer in the world), but did you know that he took four years off boxing as a kid to learn traditional Ukrainian dance?
What about Ester Ledecká, the first woman ever to win gold in two different sports (skiing and snowboarding) at the same Winter Olympics? 
What about LeBron James, Tom Brady or Nick Foles—all of them exceptionally successful in at least one other sport?
Finally, what about the entire German national soccer team which won the World Cup in 2014? As a team of scientists demonstrated, it almost exclusively comprised late specializers who didn’t play more organized soccer than amateur-league players until age twenty-two or later!
What’s the catch? And does it apply outside sports as well? 
Klein vs Kahneman, aka Experience vs Performance
To answer these questions, maybe we should turn to the findings of Gary Klein and 
, two pioneers in the study of human decision making.
Both of them had spent years studying the connection between experience and performance, but, strangely enough, they had reached quite different conclusions.
Klein studied firefighting and naval commandeers and realized that between 80 and 95 percent of their decisions are made “instinctively and in seconds,” or, to use the title of another Malcolm Gladwell book, 
. 
His investigations discovered why and how this happens: whether firefighters or naval commanders, these people are experienced enough to recognize repeating patterns and, thus, capable, to choose a common course of action—usually the first one to come to mind.
So, something like chess players. “I see a move, a combination, almost instantly,” said Garry Kasparov, arguably the greatest chess player in history, to the author of this book, betting that most grandmasters “usually make the move that springs to mind in the first few seconds of thought.”
Daniel Kahneman, however, discovered something far more peculiar than this. Working as a young lieutenant in the psychology unit of the Israel Defense Forces, he noticed that neither he nor his colleagues were able to guess correctly assess an officer candidate, no matter how many times they tried.
Even after years of assessing, they were still barely better than an average human blind guessing. The experience didn’t make them any better than beginners; there was a “complete lack of connection between the statistical information and the compelling experience of insight.”
So, who was right: Klein or Kahneman? Does experience inevitably make one better in his field or does it have no effect after a certain point?
Kind vs Wicked Learning Environments
The answer to both of the questions posited above is 
.
And we discovered this because a decade ago, in 2009, Kahneman and Klein decided to collaborate on a paper and find common ground. 
And they did find it, agreeing that: 
And the reason for that?
The learning environment inherent to the field in question! 
In essence, specialists get better with experience only in learning environments where “patterns repeat over and over, and feedback is extremely accurate and usually very rapid.” These (after Robin Hogarth) are called “kind working environments” and are perfect for trial-and-error “deliberate” learners.
Think of golf or chess or playing the guitar or programming. When you make a mistake, in all of these disciplines, you know that you’ve made a mistake, and you try to correct it on your second attempt. Repeat this for years and you’re bound to become an expert.
However, this doesn’t work as well in the so-called “wicked learning environments,” where “the rules of the game are often unclear or incomplete, there may or may not be repetitive patterns and they may not be obvious, and feedback is often delayed, inaccurate, or both.”
Think of the arts now, or of political trends or of doctors. How do you know if a verse is good or not, or whether you’ve made the right prediction? Even better, 
do you realize your mistake? Are there patterns in accordance to which you can correct it easily?
A Brief Manual for Becoming a Generalist
All of the above are, of course, rhetorical questions, and they all form the basis of David Epstein’s main argument. 
Namely, that specialization is all but outdated, because it mostly works in fields where humans will probably be replaced by robots in the near future.  
A much better way to achieve something in the world of tomorrow is by allowing yourself to become a Jack-of-all-trades before you naturally start investing your time and attention into one particular discipline. 
David Epstein’s main bits of advice to help you on this journey are the following ones:
Sample everything from math and physics to dancing and playing the guitar! The disorderly path of experimentation pays off in the long run. 
It’s not a coincidence that Nobel laureates in science are 22 times more likely to have artistic pursuits outside their field than their less-recognized peers!
As Epstein says, “experimentation is not a tidy prescription, but it is common, and it has advantages, and it requires more than the typical motivational-poster lip service to a tolerance for failure. Breakthroughs are high variance.”
So, test and try out new and different things, constantly creating, manufacturing, and generating artifacts. The more work you produce, the higher the chances you’ll churn out a dud, but also the higher the chances of a supernova success!
Two letters make so much difference, don’t they?
Usually people advise other people to not 
 behind, but Epstein says quite the opposite: don’t 
 behind no matter where you are in your life.
Don’t be Julius Caesar who broke down in tears upon seeing a statue of Alexander the Great when he was a young man. “Alexander at my age had conquered so many nations, and I have all this time done nothing that is memorable,” he supposedly said. 
Pretty soon, he ruled an empire even greater than that of Alexander and this concern was a distant memory.
“Compare yourself to yourself yesterday,” suggests Epstein, “not to younger people who aren’t you. Everyone progresses at a different rate, so don’t let anyone else make you feel behind. You probably don’t even know where exactly you’re going, so feeling behind doesn’t help.”
Though head starts are overrated and “mental meandering and personal experimentation” are exceptional sources of power, don’t forget that there is nothing inherently wrong with specialization.
And don’t forget to start specializing in some area, at some point or the other, to one degree or another. 
We all do it, after all.
Key Lessons from “Range”
1.      Tiger the Specialist vs Roger the Generalist
2.      Kind vs Wicked Learning Environments
3.      How and Why to Become a Generalist
Tiger the Specialist vs Roger the Generalist
When it comes to mastering a certain sphere, there are two kinds of people in this world: Tigers and Rogers.
The first ones are very much like Tiger Woods: they are guided from a very early age toward a certain type of success, and through thousands of hours of deliberate practice, they inevitably achieve it.
The latter ones are not unlike Roger Federer: they take up a certain profession late in their lives after spending years dabbling between many different professions. However, they too achieve immense success eventually.
Interestingly, David Epstein argues, the Rogers are much more common than the Tigers—and, no matter what all those books say, in many cases, the head start doesn’t matter. 
Kind vs Wicked Learning Environments
The reason why a head start matters in golf is that the game offers a kind learning environment. In other words, it is repetitive and the feedback is extremely accurate. Hit it this hard and the ball doesn’t reach the hole; consequently, you should hit the ball with less force the next time.
This, however, doesn’t work if you are a surgeon, a psychologist, or a poet. There are no discernible repetitive patterns, and the feedback is slow. Practice and experience help little in these cases. Because these are all wicked learning environments.
How and Why to Become a Generalist
As a rule of thumb, kind learning environments, due to their repetitive nature, are great for computers to excel in: a computer can learn how to play chess better than any human, but it has difficulties learning how to write a beautiful poem.
This is why you should become a generalist: robots can replace humans in kind working environments, but wicked learning environments are for humans only.
So, become a generalist!
To do that, experiment as much as you can, and never 
behind. However, never forget that there is nothing wrong with a little specialization from time to time.

Our Critical Review
Dubbed “groundbreaking” by many authors, 
challenges a notion not many believe can be challenged—namely, that specialization is the only path to excellence.
And Epstein does this in such a compelling manner that even the main advocates of the opposite are sufficiently convinced and have wholeheartedly endorsed this book (we already quoted Malcolm Gladwell above).
“
 is an urgent and important book, an essential read for bosses, parents, coaches, and anyone who cares about improving performance,” writes 
, amidst commending Epstein on his writing and ability to make the complex comprehensive.
“In a world that’s increasingly obsessed with specialization,” adds 
, “star science writer David Epstein is here to convince you that the future may belong to generalists. It’s a captivating read that will leave you questioning the next steps in your career—and the way you raise your children.”

If you are a coach, then, undoubtedly, you already have your own method dealing with clients. 
But do you know the scientific basis of your method? Do you want neuroscientific tips to enhance its success?

Who Should Read “Neuroscience for Coaches”? And Why?
Even though all readers may find some interesting things here—like, for example, which parts of the brain are responsible for which activities, and how you can trigger them when you need them (or turn them off when they are a nuisance)—as suggested by the title, this book is specifically written for coaches. 
In other words, if you are not a coach then you can easily skip this book without any fear that you’ve missed something. If you are a coach, however—regardless of your specific line of work—this book will probably become your very special little encyclopedia.

“Neuroscience for Coaches PDF Summary”
We’ve summarized 
, but, at least to our recollection, none of them defined coach the way Amy Brann does in the first sentence of 
: “an expert in facilitating self-directed neuroplasticity.”
At first, it may sound a bit mouthful, but if you knew that “neuroplasticity” refers to the brain’s ability to change and if you recalled that 
, then you would see why Brann’s definition is right on the spot. 
To translate it into the language of the common men, it states nothing more than a few facts: 1) that our brain can change; 2) that we can direct the course of its changes; and 3) that a coach is someone who helps us direct this course in a more disciplined manner.
That is, after all, what the etymology of the word “coach” encompasses: a 
is an old word for “a wagon” or “a carriage,” and a 
, much like a wagon or a carriage, takes someone from point A to point B.

 coaching has a long history and, as Brann says, “a huge number of different models, strategies and training programs” have developed around coaching.

It merely uses the new findings in neuroscience “to

should help you understand 
 some of the methods you use as a coach work, and why others don’t, in addition to offering you a clearer picture of what goes around a student’s mind during each of the coaching stages.
Exceptionally structured, Amy Brann’s book is nothing short of an encyclopedia on the subject and a long Q&A session on everything related to it. Therefore, it is impossible for a summary to do the book enough justice (it is in itself a summary of a vast body of knowledge), but nothing stops us from bringing you all the highlights from its first part.
In it, Amy Brann introduces us to the structure of the brain and its various areas and explains why coaches should be aware of each of them and how they can use them to facilitate progress and make the most of their training methods. 
So, let’s go!
The Triune Brain 
Before delving deeper into the structure of our brains, in a brief introduction, Brann introduces her readers to the evolutionary model of the triune brain, developed by physician and neuroscientist Paul D. MacLean in the 1960s.
According to this model, “attractive in its simplicity” and “widely espoused,” there are three parts of the brain: the reptilian, the paleomammalian (the limbic), and the neomammalian. 
The first (and the oldest) is responsible for instinctual behaviors, the second for “things like motivation and emotion involved in feeding, reproductive behavior and parental behavior,” and the last one “for our higher cognitive functions such as planning, perceiving and language.”
However, modern science is highly skeptical of MacLean’s model and numerous authors suggest that we should abandon it altogether. Unfortunately, the model is very present in non-scientific circles, and this is the only reason why Brann offers this introductory sketch.
If you use it, she advises, you need to use it with caution and aware that it functions best as a metaphor or an analogy. In truth, the structure of the brain is far more complex, and, consequently, our reactions are much less predictable.
1 Prefrontal cortex
The prefrontal cortex (PFC), as Brann writes, is “affectionately thought of as the CEO or conductor of the brain responsible for higher-level cognitive functions.” 
One of the newest brain areas, it is involved in all our executive functions, our ability to plan, decision making, expressing our personality, aligning our thoughts and actions with internal goals, and moderating social behavior.
Consequently, it should be very important to coaches, who need to never forget two things:
• The PFC doesn’t function well under stress
• The PFC is unable to multitask
So, in coaching, you must aim to reduce stress, encourage focus, and break down long lessons into smaller chunks.
2 Basal ganglia
The basal ganglia is “key to storing routines, repetitive behaviors and thoughts.” In one phrase, it is “the home of habits.” These habits are stored in the form of thousands of mini-programs or maps which follow sets of “if/then” orders.
The main objective of the basal ganglia is simple: to save your brain some energy for more important operations by turning on the autopilot whenever it can.
Coaching is always about change and progress, so it is essential for your client to understand the structure and the function of the basal ganglia as well. This should help him see why his whole body is so resistant to new habits but also set him up for 
.
3 Striatum and nucleus accumbens
The core component of the basal ganglia, the striatum is a sort of a relay station which receives input from the cerebral cortex and gives input to the basal ganglia. The part of the ventrium closest to the face is called ventral striatum, and part of it is the nucleus accumbens.
This part is “involved in pleasure, reward, motivation, reinforcement learning, fear, addiction, impulsivity and the placebo effect.” Consequently, it is pretty important for coaches to understand it. 
For example, the nucleus accumbens proves that, even though it sounds as if something picked straight out of an SF movie, it is a scientific fact that there are things happening inside your brain even when you are just imagining things. 
That’s why, imagining a scene when a certain goal has been achieved—what football great Pelé deemed 
—is helpful. This doesn’t mean that (as many self-help books claim) visualizing a goal magically leads to its fulfillment.
However, it does mean that visualizing something has a positive effect on your brain and makes the internal environment in your body a more favorable one. 
“People are more likely to be motivated and take goal-oriented behaviors with a boost of dopamine in the NA,” concludes Amy Brann, busting one of the greatest myths in the self-help industry, “and so visualization may make a particular outcome more likely.”
4 Insular cortex
There is an insula in each of the brain hemispheres; they are areas of the cortex folded deep down between the temporal, parietal and frontal lobes.
These insulae are very well connected to the amygdala and are involved in a range of things, including emotions, perception, self-awareness, decision making, cognitive functioning, and interpersonal experience. 
In fact, some authors (such as the renowned Antonio Damasio) suggests that it is because of the insular cortex that rational thinking cannot be separated from feelings and emotions. When the insular cortex is thicker, people are more capable of making a distinction between the objective and the subjective and are much more “in tune” with themselves.
It has been demonstrated by numerous studies that mindfulness and meditation—and even yoga and Pilates—improves the cortical structure and makes people more self-aware. No wonder they are included in many coaching programs nowadays: science backs the idea that they should work.
5 Amygdala
The amygdala is an important part of the limbic system which is heavily involved in regulating our emotional life. It is also important in memory, attention (the ability to focus on something while excluding something else) and social processing.
Simplified, the amygdala is the seat of the “fight-or-flight” response in your brain and the part of the brain which reacts most instinctively, so special care should be taken by coaches if they want to maximize their client’s performance.
Amy Brann suggests several things:
• Fear may hold back a client, so you should be alert if his amygdala is overreacting; sometimes, just opening a discussion on the topic is helpful in itself, since it redirects the brain energy from the amygdala to the prefrontal cortex.
• It is quite possible that “just by being around fear-inducing stuff your unconscious will pick up on this” and you’ll start underperforming. Therefore, start reducing negative inputs: turn off the news, don’t read the newspaper, avoid negative people.
• Help your client with his fears by translating them into challenges. This is hugely important since it should free up other areas of your client’s brain and he’ll be more effective and efficient. 
• Help your client to explore unconscious fear triggers.
• Prevent your client from making big decisions when he/she is anxious or fearful.
• Science says that “working under pressure doesn’t create optimal brain environments.” So, experiment with alternatives which include discipline, plans, and long-term objectives.
6 Anterior cingulate cortex
The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) looks like a collar stretched around the frontal part of the corpus callosum (the bundle of neural fibers that connect the left and right hemispheres) and is primarily responsible for conflict or error detection.
According to Francis Crick, 
, the anterior cingulate cortex may be the place where human free will is stored. 
Why?
Because the anterior cingulate cortex is excellent in comparing expectations and reality and is great at revealing to us whether what we get is what we have expected. The ACC is more about “awareness” than it is about 
things, which is why coaches need to stimulate it before doing anything else.
Since the ACC detects errors, motivating clients to assess and reassess situations by making a constant comparison is always very useful.
7 Hypothalamus
The hypothalamus is a small area of the brain responsible for various metabolic processes and synthesizing and secreting neurohormones.
It is important in “regulating hunger, aspects of parenting and attachment behaviors, thirst, fatigue and sleep.”
Consequently, unless you are working with clients on weight-loss goals, there’s not much you can do with them even if you knew everything hypothalamus-related.
8 Hippocampus
Located in the medial temporal lobe of the brain and resembling a seahorse, the hippocampus consolidates information from short- to long-term memory. 
A 
 demonstrated that people’s hippocampi are more active when they are successfully navigating, which is why cab drivers have larger than average hippocampi. On the other hand, PTSD results in reductions in the hippocampal volumes. 
Why?
Possibly because of cortisol (a marker of stress) which has been shown to kill hippocampal cells in animals.
If you want to help your clients and excel as a coach, there are several things that you can do to activate the hippocampus and, thus, stimulate memory.
• Start doing regular aerobic exercise
• Keep cortisol levels low by reducing stress
• Turn off your GPS and start finding your way around town using nothing but your brain.
Key Lessons from “Neuroscience for Coaches”
1.      The Triune Brain Model Is Not Accepted by Neuroscientists
2.      Our Actions Are Influenced by the Structure of Our Brains and Several Brain Chemicals
3.      The Complexities of the Quantum Brain
The Triune Brain Model Is Not Accepted by Neuroscientists
You’ve probably read this in many books: our brain consists of three parts, the oldest of which (the reptilian) is responsible for our instincts, the middle one (the limbic) for things like motivation and emotion, and the newest one (the neomammalian) for cognitive functions (language, planning, anticipation).
Well, we’d hate to burst your bubble but this is not backed by science. This model—called the model of the triune brain—was proposed by Paul D. MacLean in the 1960s and has since been disproven as a simplistic understanding of how our brain works.
In reality, things are much more complex.
Our Actions Are Influenced by the Structure of Our Brains and Several Brain Chemicals
Even though our brain is much more complex than what the proponents of the triune model would like you to believe, it is still highly compartmentalized, with different parts of it responsible for different functions. 
Naturally, we are far from understanding all of them, but we do know, thanks to numerous studies, roughly which parts are responsible for roughly which actions and can predict how a human might act in the absence of some of these brain parts.
The same holds true for the brain chemicals—
—which means that, despite the complexity, a coach can direct someone else’s brain-behavior in the right direction using science.
In fact, that’s Amy Brann’s definition of a coach: “an expert in facilitating self-directed neuroplasticity.”
The Complexities of the Quantum Brain
Amy Brann’s book uses classical biology and classical physics as its basis, but does make a brief intermission in the fifth chapter to talk about something she refers to as “the quantum brain.”
Basically, she says that modern physics has questioned the postulates of classical physics and that this may mean that classical neuroscience will soon make space for a much more modern approach as well.
This approach may reveal that some things such as “feeling,” “knowing” and “effort” are “intrinsically mentalistic and experiential and so cannot be described exclusively in terms of their material make-up,” which is not something most scientists are ready to accept nowadays.

Our Critical Review
As John Leary-Joyce—CEO of the Academy of Executive Coaching—suggests 
is the book which can help you “provide a rational neuroscientific explanation for the interventions” and make the move from “Trust me I’m the coach” to “Here’s the explanation for why this will work.”We agree enthusiastically: this is a book that every coach even remotely interested in the

 “The Executive Guide to Artificial Intelligence PDF Summary”
Whether you are a fan or not, AI is one of the most talked-about technologies in the business world today. 
How can it not be?
It delivers numerous benefits as it is, and it promises to deliver even more as it is being perfected.
The problem, however—as it is often the case when new technologies emerge—is that very few executives and managers understand what AI offers and even fewer are willing to investigate the matter, repelled and confused by the “bewildering bundle of algorithms and jargon,” by the “confusing terminology, inflated expectations and dire warnings of ‘robot overlords.’”
Even though the truth is not at all simple—suggests Andrew Burgess in 
—it 
 be simplified.
Hence, his book, whose mission is not only to demystify AI for everyone interested in it but also to provide a blueprint for executives and managers who want to identify where it can help them and implement its applications in their organizations.
So, allow us to walk you through it!
Defining AI and Its Applications
Even though when most people think of AI think of the “robot overlords” mentioned above, AI is, in fact, everywhere around us. 
Some of its uses today, reminds us Burges, “as planning a route in our satnav or getting a phrase translated in our browser, are so ubiquitous that we forget that there is actually some really clever stuff happening in the background.”
Well, that clever stuff is done by AI, defined by the OED
as “the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence.”
Now, that definition doesn’t tell the whole story, since debates are raging day in day out on whether AI should merely 
the human mind or 
 it altogether. And they are said to be as old as the discipline itself.
According to a famous anecdote, one of the two “founders” of AI, Marvin Minsky, enthusiastic about the opportunities AI offers, told his colleague at MIT Douglas Engelbart that “we’re going to make machines intelligent. We are going to make them conscious!”
Engelbart, 
 back in 1968 (in the “mother of all demos), supposedly replied: “You’re going to do all that for the machines? What are you going to do for the people?”
Well, Engelbart was a bit too pessimistic since AI can already do a number of things for the people who know how to use its potential.
For example, in addition to translating and navigating, It can also:
No wonder the World Economic Forum is 
, and Yuval Noah Harari is warning millennials everywhere that 
.
That is how things stand even today: a robot might take your job any instant now (
), and AI is to blame for that.
But that is not bad at all.
A Brief History of AI
Since we already mentioned Minsky and Engelbart, it is only appropriate that we mention a thing or two about some other historical developments in the field of AI so that we can understand how we got to be on the brink of automation.
In a nutshell, the evolution of AI is the development of controlled if/then workflows through guided learning systems to machine learning.
As mentioned, in the beginning, AI comprised nothing more than the development of “if this than that” programs called “expert systems.” These expert systems were basically knowledge maps, branching out in one or another direction based on the choice made by a user. 
Under the guise of AI, many of these systems are still in use today: most of those chatbots you encounter on your favorite websites use nothing more than rudimentary AI.
Due to little funding and over-inflated expectations, AI passed through two “AI Winters,” during which advances in the technology stagnated. Both of them lasted for six years (the first one between 1974 to 1980, and the second one from 1987 to 1993), but nowadays it is very different due to “four key drivers”:
• 
: AI needs “millions of examples” to be accurate, but today’s continual use of the Internet provides it with even more data than necessary;
• 
: In 1980, 1GB of storage cost, on average, $437,500. Just a decade later, it was a fortieth of that price: $11,200. Nowadays, 1GB of storage costs less than 2 cents!
• 
:
 we’ve already told you a little bit about 
; well, it turns out its predictions were accurate—processors are getting smaller and faster every single year.
• 
: up until 1993, very few people had Internet; now, very few people don’t. That’s a big difference.
Thanks to these key drivers, AI is getting better by the second and is now able to learn in an unsupervised manner. 
In the more common supervised learning, AI systems are trained and guided by other people. For example, if you want AI to learn what is a dog, you can train it by “feeding” it with millions of images and telling it which ones of them are dogs, and which are not.
However, in the more SF unsupervised learning, systems start with a blank slate, and they are fed data which initially means nothing to them. In time, however, they are able to notice patterns and make sense of it.
AI Capabilities Framework
Andrew Burgess has developed a framework that “boils down” all of AI’s complexity into eight capabilities, subsequently divided into two sets:
• Image recognition 
• Speech recognition
• Search
• Clustering
• Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
• Optimization
• Prediction
• Understanding
Now the first four capabilities listed above (image and speech recognition, search, and clustering) focus on figuring out “
 is happening” in a data set. They identify, distinguish and group things, converting unstructured data to structured data.
The second set deals more with 
 the structured data (“
 is it happening”) in one way or another and, unlike the first set (which is training-based) includes some type of machine-based (almost independent) output. 
NLU, for example, includes a degree of understanding and it requires cognition. It is through a similar type of cognition that machines are able to transform data from one form or another (optimization) or even predict whether something will happen or not (prediction).
The last of these eight capabilities—understanding—is still not commercially available, but it is what most people expect AI to become: conscious awareness of a machine of its thoughts and actions.
AI in Action
Though Artificial Intelligence can do a lot of things, it can’t do everything. But in combination with some associated technologies (cloud computing, robotics, IoT, or crowdsourcing), it can change absolutely everything about the world that we know.
In fact, it is already changing things!
We’ve already mentioned chatbots which are so simple that they are not even considered AI anymore. But though they do 
things for which human intelligence is necessary and that is a great thing. Complex chatbots can do so much more: through extensive training, they can become almost indistinguishable from humans—
.
All of the recommendations you get on Amazon or Netflix are due to AI, which is immensely better than humans in suggesting future purchases (optimization & prediction) based on previous acquisitions (search & clustering). 
British retailer Tesco combines AI and robotics to ease restocking. Through image recognition, robots identify product gaps by filming the shelves and comparing them to the shelves’ optimal condition.
Possibly even more interesting and less known, an Israeli tech company named Nexar teaches people to become better drivers by using and structuring information from a dashcam app.
All in all, the options are many, and leaders should identify the spheres where AI can help them and act as soon as possible.
Your AI Journey
Burgess is often asked by executives how can they implement AI in their business. He claims it is the wrong question. The much more appropriate one is: “I have some big business objectives/challenges—how can AI help me deliver or address them?”
Well, this is how.
As is the case with everything else, implementing AI starts with self-
, and Burgess suggests using the “AI Maturity Matrix” before doing anything else. 
Originally developed by Carnegie Mellon University to assess the maturity of IT development functions, maturity matrices generally describe five levels of maturity—from very immature (Level 1, or ‘Initial’) to world-class (Level 5, or ‘Optimizing’).
However, the “AI Maturity Matrix” has six levels rather than five:
: 
. This is the basic level when there is very little evidence of any IT optimization in an organization.
. The organization has implemented task-specific IT applications for particular processes (e.g., an invoice processing application to process invoices), but has not applied automation more broadly.
. Some people in an organization do things automatically (using scripts or macros) with little to no benefit; data is still managed on a nominal basis.
. At level 3, an organization starts tactically applying a single automation tool to meet specific goals.
. At this stage, an organization already has a reputation for implementing new technologies and being innovative, since it has started deploying a range of automation tools, whose benefits are observable and sizeable.
. At this level, an organization has implemented a strategic end-to-end process automation program with a range of automation tools, including AI.
In addition to this “AI Maturity Matrix,” Burgess advises creating an “AI Heat Map” as well so that a company can get “a top-down perspective on areas where AI is desirable, economically viable and/or technically feasible.”
An AI Heat Map looks something like this:
There are many steps between the “AI Maturity Matrix”/”AI Heat Map” and the implementation of AI in your organization—say, developing the AI business case, an AI roadmap, an AI strategy—but let’s say you’re there. What’s next?
Well, first of all, you must align everything with your new vision: a Level-5 AI-based automated company. This includes adding new positions such as CAO (chief automation officer) and CDO (chief data officer).
The last one is especially important if you take into consideration that with AI, data is everything, and “data fidelity” can make or break AI. 
Speaking of which, there’s always hazard that AI can also break your company, since, much like Sheldon from 
,
it doesn’t understand social conventions, and can be hacked, via training, by people with malicious intentions. (Just ask 
 who became a racist after a single day).
Finally, AI can be used as a tool against AI. For example, if you are a bank, and you implement voice recognition as part of your safety system, an AI can be trained to mimic the voices necessary to gain access to a specific account.
The Future of AI
Be that as it may, AI’s future looks brighter than ever!
Image and voice recognition have been improving so well during the past few years that, very soon, it would be difficult to recognize whether you’re talking to a bot or a real person on the phone (not to mention, 
).
Clustering and searching are becoming ever more efficient and accurate, which means that optimization and predicting will also improve. The only problem—and it will be a problem for a while—is the lack of high-quality data sets, but Burgess believes that will find a solution for that as well. Afterward, both NLU and Understanding

AI Is Everywhere Around You
Whether you’re using Google Translate to understand what the tattoo of your favorite pop artist means in your language or you’re navigating through the streets of Cairo, whether you are searching for very specific information in a large bulk of data or simply clicking on images of traffic lights in captchas—you are actually either using or training AI systems.
AI’s Complexity Can Be Boiled Down into a Framework of Eight Capabilities
Even though AI is a complex phenomenon, Andrew Burgess has devised a framework which boils down its complexity into eight capabilities: image recognition, speech recognition, search, clustering, natural language understanding (NLU), optimization, prediction, and understanding.
The first four of these skills help AI understand “
 is happening” in a given data set, and in the other four it is coming up with a solution as to “
 it is happening.”
Almost all AI-based apps can be explained through the use of these eight capabilities.
AI Is Here to Stay—and You Better Implement It in Your Company Fast
Every time you search for something on Google or post something on Facebook, you are feeding AI—which makes it stronger and better. At least for now, there’s no way to stop this, meaning you better join in.
No matter what kind of an organization you lead, AI can help you in numerous ways, so you better assess how mature you are for the transformation (via an “AI maturity matrix”), identify how can AI help you improve (via an “AI heat map”) and start implementing it and automating processes!

The Fearless Organization Summary,https://blog.12min.com/the-fearless-organization-pdf-summary/,https://blog.12min.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image3.png,"12 min read ⌚ 
Do you work for a company whose employees would rather keep silent about an issue than express their opinion in fear they’d face some kind of retribution? Have you ever thought that you may be the boss in such an organization?
Either way, it’s time to change that! Amy C. Edmondson is here to teach you how to turn your company into a psychologically safe workplace, or, as she would say:
.
Who Should Read “The Fearless Organization”? And Why?
If you don’t know Amy Edmondson, then it’s not a bad idea to get to know her via her 
 which discusses psychologically safe workplaces and how to build them.
If you’ve already watched the TED Talk, then you already know this is a great book, which should interest bosses and employees alike, hopefully even inspiring both groups (especially the former) to change their ways.
About Amy Edmondson
 is an American scholar, the Novartis Professor of Leadership and Management at the Harvard Business School.
After working as Chief Engineer for renowned architect/inventor Buckminster Fuller in the 1980s, Edmondson embarked on an exceptional academic career, specializing in concepts such as “teaming” and “psychological safety.”
She has been included in the biannual Thinkers50 list every time since 2011, and even honored with its Talent Award in 2017.
“The Fearless Organization PDF Summary”
“Today’s employees,” writes Edmondson in the “Introduction” to 
,
“at all levels, spend 50% more time collaborating than they did 20 years ago. Hiring talented individuals is not enough,” she deduces. “They have to be able to work well together.”
Unsurprisingly, teamwork is not an under-researched phenomenon. 
On the contrary: whether it is through fables (Lencioni’s 
and 
) or through more rigorous interdisciplinary analogy-based studies (General Stanley McChrystal’s 
), teamwork is one of the most investigated aspects of modern work environments. 
In one of the more thought-provoking and wide-ranging analyses of this subject, Daniel Coyle’s 
, the author singles out “safety” as the most crucial skill in the toolkit of a thriving work environment.
Anne Edmonson agrees and goes a step further: in her two-decade-long research of the topic, she has discovered that a factor she calls “psychological safety” “helps explain differences in performance in workplaces that include hospitals, factories, schools, and government agencies.”
What does she mean by psychological safety?
In her own words:
Of course, as Amy Edmonson makes abundantly clear, psychological safety is not the only factor that needs to be taken into consideration as far as work performance is concerned. However, she has purposefully singled it out because, as she demonstrates, it is certainly one of the most important ones in today’s world—as proven by its popularity in the last few years.
A pioneer in the area, Edmondson explores every aspect of this culture of psychological safety in 
, and provides “a blueprint for bringing it to life.” In fact, a psychologically safe company is what a fearless organization essentially is: “one in which interpersonal fear is minimized so that team and organizational performance can be maximized in a knowledge-intensive world.”
This book is divided into three parts which are in turn divided into a total of eight chapters. Let’s have a look at each of them!
Part I: The Power of Psychological Safety
The first part of 
consists of two chapters “that introduce the concept of psychological safety and offer a brief history of the research on this important workplace phenomenon.”
We’ll look at why psychological safety matters, as well as why it’s not the norm in many organizations.
Through “a disguised true story taking place in a hospital,” Edmonson introduces the readers to the concept of psychological safety, showing “at once the ordinariness of an employee holding back at work—not sharing a concern or a question—as well as the profound implications this human reflex can have for the quality of work in almost any organization.”
Contrary to what many leaders believed in the past, fear is not an effective motivator, and this is doubly true today when most jobs require people to learn, improve, and collaborate almost constantly. Due to fear, consciously or not, people often inhibit themselves from sharing their ideas, questions, and concerns, and when people don’t speak up, the organization’s ability to innovate and grow is threatened.
So that they can stop being silent, a psychologically safe climate must be cultivated. 
However, bear in mind 
…
• …
: conflict would (and should) inevitably arise, no matter how perfect the work environment is; psychological safety is about being honest and about letting people on different sides of a conflict express their opinions;
• 
: work climate affects different people in similar ways; regardless of whether they are introverts or extroverts, most workers would speak their mind up in a psychologically safe environment;
• 
: though similar concepts, the key difference between trust and psychological safety is that the latter is not experienced at personal, but at a group level. In addition, as Edmondson says, “trust is about giving others the benefit of the doubt, and psychological safety relates to whether others will give you the benefit of the doubt when, for instance, you have asked for help or admitted a mistake.”
• 
: psychological safety is not about being “comfortable” at work or about creating “anything goes” environment. As the table below demonstrates, It is about quite the opposite:
In the second chapter of 
, Edmondson
presents “key findings from a systematic review of academic research on psychological safety.”
She doesn’t provide many details on the individual studies listed in the bibliography, but gives “an overview of how research on psychological safety has provided evidence supporting the central argument in this book—that no twenty-first-century organization can afford to have a culture of fear.”
The studies Edmondson overviews show that a fearless organization “is not only a better place for employees, it’s also a place where innovation, growth, and performance take hold.”
Part II: Psychological Safety at Work
The four chapters in the second part of 
“present real-world case studies of workplaces in both private and public-sector organizations to show how psychological safety (or its absence) shapes business results and human safety performance.”
In the third chapter, Edmondson digs into a few cases in which “workplace fear allowed an illusion of business success, postponing inevitable discoveries of underlying problems that had gone unreported and unaddressed for a period of time.”
The chapter covers the rise and demise of a few iconic companies (Volkswagen, Nokia, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs) led and managed by way of fear, possibly best illustrated in the two quotations used as epigraphs to this chapter: 
• “I feel misused by my own company.” — Oliver Schmidt, Volkswagen engineer
• “Until I know what my boss thinks, I don’t want to tell you.” — Regulator, Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY)
The main takeaways from these studies (and this chapter) are the following:
• If you are a leader and you only want to hear good news, you create fear which blocks you from learning the truth—until it is too late;
• Consequently, a lack of psychological safety—aka a work environment in which people can voice their opinions—only creates an illusion of success, which, in the long run, can turn into serious business failure;
• A psychologically safe environment is not that fragile since shortcomings become known early and the size and the impact of the future failure can nearly always be mitigated.
The fourth chapter starts where the third leaves off and “highlights workplaces where employees, customers, or communities suffered avoidable physical or emotional harm because employees, living in a culture of fear, were reluctant to speak up, ask questions, or get help.”
“A culture of silence is a dangerous culture,” warns Edmondson, demonstrating how in many places (say, hospitals or nuclear reactors: remember 
?), not creating a psychologically safe environment is not a luxury one has, because it can lead to a tragic loss of life.
“Excessive confidence in authority is a risk factor in psychological and physical safety,” concludes Edmondson, advising leaders to be more open to criticism and willing to learn from their subordinates.
After showing the dangers of the old-style fear-based management, in the fifth chapter Edmondson finally shows us the other side of the coin, introducing us to the psychologically safe environment of a few organizations she is not afraid to describe as “fearless.”
“Barry Wehmiller, Google X, Eileen Fisher, Bridgewater, and Pixar,” she writes in the conclusion of this chapter, “have little in common on the surface. Yet they have managed to create work environments characterized by unusual levels of candor, engagement, collaboration, and risk-taking, all of which have contributed to the creation of successful businesses—in strikingly varied ways.”
The three crucial takeaways from Chapter 5:
• If the employees are encouraged to be honest, the company is more creative and more innovative;
• If you are a leader, be willing to say “I don’t know” when you don’t have an answer: these three simple words are so powerful in engaging the hearts and minds of employees that, without too much exaggeration, can be described as the basis of a psychologically safe environment.
• all in all, “creating an environment that values employees yields benefits in engagement, problem-solving, and performance.”
Chapter 6 examines a few more psychologically safe companies, “where psychological safety helps to ensure employee and client safety and dignity.”
The cases covered here show that “clear, direct, candid communication is an important aspect of reducing accidents” and that “worker safety starts with encouraging and reinforcing employees’ speaking up about hazards and other concerns.”
That is why a good company is one which motivates its workers to do whatever is necessary to ensure safe-work practices and employee dignity, even at the cost of immediate losses. 
History has repeatedly shown that this pays dividends—in the long run.
Part III: Creating a Fearless Organization
In the third part of 
Edmondson includes two chapters which “focus on the question of what leaders must do to create a fearless organization—an organization where everyone can bring his or her full self to work, contribute, grow, thrive, and team up to produce remarkable results.”
Chapter 7 is one of the most essential chapters in Edmondson’s book since it contains the leader’s tool kit, aka a simple three-step framework of activities which leaders—at the top and throughout an organization—can use to create a more engaged and vital workforce. 
The three interrelated practices which help in creating psychological safety are: setting the stage, inviting participation, and responding productively.
As shown on the table below, each of these practices encompasses sub-steps that “must be repeatedly used, in 
, learning-oriented ways, to create and restore a climate of candor in an ongoing way.”
The final chapter updates a few stories and offers answers to some of the questions the author is most frequently asked by people in companies regarding psychological safety. 
Here are the three that seemed most interesting to us:
The short answer is “no” and the long answer that even if there is such a thing as “too much psychological safety,” the risks of being a fear-based company far exceed those of going beyond the limit of optimal psychological safety.
On the contrary: whistle-blowing is “not a reflection of psychological safety but rather an indication of its absence.”
 
Well, there are exceptions. Steve Jobs is a famous example, just as is Henry Ford who is reported to have once complained, “why is it every time I ask for a pair of hands, they come with a brain attached?” Edmondson suggests that there are rare geniuses who, indeed, have all the answers, but for the majority of companies, this approach is simply wrong and comes with too many risks.
Key Lessons from “The Fearless Organization”
1.      Psychological Safety Is All About Being an Employee Comfortable Expressing Yourself
2.      Psychological Safety Is Not About Lowering Performance Standards
3.      The Leader’s Tool Kit for Building Psychological Safety
Psychological Safety Is All About Being an Employee Comfortable Expressing Yourself
Until just a while ago, companies were led by arrogant top-down dictators and managed by fear. 
However, through two decades of research, Amy Edmondson has discovered that not only has this changed, but it has also changed for a reason: companies do not have the luxury of being psychologically unsafe.
Working for a company where you cannot express yourself, and you are in constant fear that the things you’d say may be met with ridicule and contempt is not only bad for you—it is bad for the company as well.
Numerous studies and case studies prove that, in these kinds of environments, success is only a short-term concept.
Psychological Safety Is Not About Lowering Performance Standards
Many managers and leaders think that allowing their subordinates to express their opinion freely is a recipe for disaster—at least in terms of performance standards.
However, Edmondson says that creating a psychologically safe environment doesn’t mean creating a comfort zone—it means replacing the anxiety zone for a “Learning & High-Performance Zone” where ideas are constantly pitted against each other, and creativity blooms out of conflict.
The Leader’s Tool Kit for Building Psychological Safety
In essence, the leader’s tool kit is a three-step blueprint which aims to structure the actions and activities of someone who is in charge of a company with the final goal of creating a fearless psychologically safe organization.
First, a leader must set the stage by framing the work (setting the expectations and clarifying the need for voice) and emphasizing the purpose (identifying what’s at stake, why it matters and for whom) so that he accomplishes an atmosphere of shared expectations and meaning.
Next, he must invite participation by demonstrating situational humility (admitting gaps), practicing inquiry (asking good questions) and setting up structures and processes (creating forums and providing guidelines for discussion). 
This results in confidence in the employees that every voice is welcome and sets the stage for the final step: responding productively. This encompasses expressing appreciation, destigmatizing failure, and sanctioning clear violations which, in turn, should achieve company-wide orientation toward continuous learning.

Later, he became the minister of the Los Angeles Divine Science Church in 1949, which, under his leadership, became one of the largest New Thought congregations in the United States.
He published his first book in 1945 (at the age of 47), but wrote a lot of books afterward. Published in 1963, 
is still considered a New Thought classic.
“The Miracles of Your Mind PDF Summary”
Published in 1953, 
is perhaps Joseph Murphy’s second best-known book, 
being the other.
We’d hate to disappoint you, but the main ideas of both are pretty the same: there are two parts of your brain, and one of them (the subconscious mind) has the tools to control the other (the conscious mind). By tapping into the power of your subconscious mind, you will be able to perform feats and endeavors science refers to as miracles, and the New Thought movement deems ancient knowledge.
Though in 
a fairly short book (about 100 pages)—Joseph Murphy lists fewer real-life examples than in 
, he does offer more practical and actionable bits of advice, mostly 1-2-3 techniques to overcome a bad habit or achieve a certain goal.
As he says in the second chapter of the book, his purpose is “to remove the mystery of the workings of the mind, in order to know better its 
.” 
As always, it is our purpose to remove the mystery of his book and pack it up in a neat summary.
So, what are we waiting for?
How Your Mind Works
“Man has only one mind, but he has two distinct phases or functions of the one mind”—that’s the introductory sentence of Murphy’s 
.
If it sounds familiar to you, that’s because it is: it is very similar to the opening sentence of the third chapter of William Walker Atkinson’ 
“Man has but one mind, but he has many mental faculties, each faculty being capable of functioning along two different lines of mental effort.”
This should surprise nobody since the philosophy underlying both books is one and the same. Only the terms are somewhere different.
For Atkinson, the two states of the mind were the active and the passive. For Murphy, they are the objective and the subjective mind (though he says that they can also be called the conscious and the subconscious mind—we’ll use this dichotomy the most—the waking and the sleeping mind, the male and the female mind, the voluntary and the involuntary mind, etc. etc.)
The objective mind is the one which deals with 
 things and uses the five physical senses to know the world. The subjective mind, on the other hand, perceives by intuition and is the seat of your emotions.
Consequently, while the objective mind is limited by the physical aspects of your existence, the subjective mind can leave the body, travel to distant lands, bring back intelligence from across space and time, and even read the contents of sealed envelopes and closed safes.
One other thing: the subjective mind is very susceptible to suggestions and, in one way or another, says yes to 
 of them. It is much like the soil: it will accept any seed you plant in it, be it good or bad. That makes your conscious mind the boss of it, even though the subconscious mind is by far the more powerful of the two:
The conscious and the subconscious mind are connected in an inverse proportion: the more one of them is used, the less the other contributes. That’s why the subconscious mind “performs its highest functions when the objective senses are in abeyance… when the conscious mind is suspended or in a sleepy, drowsy state.”
And, boy, what functions are these!
How the Subconscious Mind Can Help You
What we summed up above is the introductory—let’s just say, 
—chapter of 
. It is, by far, the most important chapter of the book since it outlines the underlying philosophy not just behind it, but also behind everything Murphy ever wrote.
The rest of the book consists of (about ten-page) chapters (six, in all) where the knowledge laid down at the beginning is translated into practical techniques which should help you achieve specific things, such as health (this is the longest chapter in the book), wealth and marital peace, as well as offer you guidance on overcoming bad habits and teething troubles such as alcoholism and fear.
Let’s speed-read through these chapters, focusing mainly on the techniques Murphy reveals and describes.
As far as Murphy is concerned, there is one—and only one—
: namely, the subconscious mind. There is also one—and only one—process of healing: faith. The equation between the two is quite simple: sincerely and naively believe that you can heal yourself, and your subconscious mind will believe you and do the rest of the work. 
This knowledge is not new, Murphy says, referring us to Paracelsus, a 16
 century alchemist, and quoting twice a belief of his: “Whether the object of your faith be true or false, you will nevertheless obtain the same effects.” 
In other words, “if you believe in the bones of saints to heal, or if you believe in the healing power of certain waters, you 
 get results, because of the powerful suggestion given to your subconscious mind; it is the latter that does the healing. The witch doctor with his incantations heals by faith also.”
It would be, of course, too easy if you could just say “I have no headache,” and you stopped having headaches for the rest of your life. True, you 
 the boss of your subconscious mind, but tyrants are never liked by their subordinates. Also, your subconscious mind doesn’t accept contradictions that easily; it accepts only what you believe and feel as true or possible.
So, what you want to do is impress your subconscious mind into cooperation; in plainer words, you need to 
 him the idea that you have no headache. As a friend of Murphy realized, though the affirmation “I have no headache” doesn’t work, the declaration “It is passing away” 
.
Especially if uttered before going to sleep or in a drowsy, reverie-like state when the conscious mind gives way to the subjective part of your being, and your subconscious mind takes over.
However, don’t ever weaken your treatment by saying things such as “I hope so,” or “It will be better.” As Murphy says, “the cellular set-up of your body will follow faithfully and honestly whatever blueprint the conscious mind hands over to them via the subconscious mind.” 
Doubt and hope are not your friends. Even worse than they are fear, hate, guilt, and inferiority—the “four basic personality difficulties… at the root of everything that goes wrong in the subconscious mind.”
Show them who is “the boss” by carefully balancing out your pitch to the subconscious mind. “Know that health is yours!” shouts Murphy. “Harmony is yours! Become intelligent by becoming a vehicle for the infinite, healing power of the subconscious mind.”
Regardless of the problem, the usual procedure to contact your subconscious mind and order him to do something consists of three steps:
#1. Take a look at the problem.
#2. Turn to the solution or way out known only to the subconscious mind (talk to it in a reverie-like state, without doubt or fear)
#3. Rest in a sense of deep conviction that it is done.
Murphy advises that you use this technique with “complete simplicity and naiveté,” “As a man imagines and feels, so is he,” says an ancient proverb, and Murphy claims that in these few words all of the knowledge a man needs to lead a happy life lies buried.
If you are an alcoholic—since, 
, “the opposite of addiction isn’t sobriety: it’s connection”—Murphy suggests a subtly updated technique, one inspired by Goethe’s practice of having “imaginary, mental conversations” with his absent friends:
#1. Get still and quite the wheels of your mind. Enter into a sleepy, drowsy state.
#2. Use a trick out of the Nancy School hypnosis-centered toolbox: “take a brief phrase which can readily be graven on the memory, and repeat it over and over again as a lullaby.” Murphy suggests the following phrase: “Sobriety and peace of mind are mine now, and I give thanks.” 
So, that you prevent your mind from wandering, you should repeat this phrase for five minutes, either aloud or “sketch its pronunciation with lips and tongue as you say it mentally.”
#3. Just before going to sleep, use Goethe’s imagine-a-friend technique. 
“Imagine a friend,” Murphy advises, “a loved one in front of you. Your eyes are closed; you are relaxed and at peace. The loved one is subjectively present and is saying to you, ‘Congratulations!’ You see the smile; you hear the voice. You touch the hand and the face; it’s all so real and vivid. The word ‘congratulations’ implies complete freedom. Hear it, over and over again, until you get the reaction which satisfies.”
“Money is essential for your economic health in this country,” states the obvious Murphy; “therefore, you should have all you need and a surplus.”
There are two reasons why you don’t already have that much: either you are constantly thinking to yourself something “foolish” about money (“I despise money.” “It is an evil thing.” “It is the root of all evil.”) or you are ordering your subconscious mind the wrong things (“I need money.” “I want wealth and success.”)
The trick is, once again, to find the most suggestible phrase and to repeat it for a few minutes in a drowsy state. In the case of money, Murphy suggests quite a few:
• “Wealth—Success.” This is the simplest one. Just repeating these two words one after another for about five minutes three or four times a day creates the necessary connections—not just between them, but also between yourself and your subconscious mind, and, finally, your subconscious mind and the world.
• “By day and by night, I am being prospered in all of my interests.” This is even gentler and, as such, it “will not arouse any argument because it does not contradict the subconscious mind’s impression of financial lack.”
• “My sales are improving every day. I am advancing, progressing, and getting wealthier every day.” Hear the happiness inside this sentence? There is no fear, doubt or guilt there. That’s why it should work!
The subconscious mind has tremendous power, but it is absolutely pointless to use it when its use would benefit nobody.
For example, if one ends up being married to a drug addict, it is not at all wise to try and use your subconscious mind to prolong that marriage (though you can); it is much better to pack your bags and leave—because even if your partner wants the opposite, that marriage is doomed to failure.
“If one of the partners has an intense desire to terminate the marriage,” writes Murphy, “and the other has an equally intense desire to remain united in marriage, and they are both sincere… this is a house divided against itself; sooner or later it will dissolve.”
That’s why “the best time to prevent a divorce is before marriage.” The cause of all of your marital trouble is that you didn’t use your subconscious mind to attract the right wife or husband. 
Murphy shares this technique if you want to achieve this:
You know how you woke up that time at 5:45 AM without the alarm, and that was precisely the hour you wanted to wake up?
Well, by now you know what happened: you suggested your subconscious mind to wake you up, and since you did this in a drowsy reverie-like state, the subconscious mind took the reins in its hands and obeyed the order.
It’s the same when you need guidance for something. In this case, however, instead of ordering your subconscious mind to do something, just ask it a question before you go to sleep. Your subconscious mind has superior wisdom, and it will give you the answer—sometimes even in your dreams.
The technique is still the same. In your bed tonight, quiet your mind, still your body and tell all of yourself to relax. Immobilize your attention and focus all of your thoughts on your problem. 
First, try and solve it with your conscious mind. Then, think about how happy you’d be when you’ve finally found the solution. Think about nothing else, though: if your mind wanders, bring it back gently.
Finally, in the sleepiest, drowsiest state before dreams come, say quietly and positively: “The answer is mine now; I know my subconscious mind knows the answer.”
Fall asleep with the mood or feeling of a found solution. Let your mind play around with this mood in a relaxed manner. Even if you drift away before you go through all of these steps, don’t worry: your subconscious mind will be active in the morning as well.
Just don’t transfer the problem to your conscious mind: your solution should come when you’re preoccupied with something else.
Remember: no matter what happens, “you will always receive guidance with respect to the subject in which you think about the most.” 
“Do the thing you fear,” said Emerson once, “and the death of fear is certain.” What he forgot to mention is that you need not do the thing you fear for real: you can imagine it and do it perfectly in your mind beforehand. Afterward, the subconscious mind will walk you on the right track.
Murphy tells the story of a singer who was afraid to sing before an audience, even though she had a beautiful voice. He suggested her the technique below and, lo and behold, she became a star. Unfortunately, Murphy doesn’t share with us her name, and we have to take his words at face value.
As for the technique.
The singer was advised to isolate herself three times a day in a quiet room. Then she was supposed to sit down comfortably in an armchair, relax her body, and close her eyes. “Physical inertia favors mental passivity,” writes Murphy, “and renders the mind more receptive to suggestion.”
So, now, it was time for suggestions. The girl was advised to say to herself something along the lines of “I sing beautifully, I am poised, serene, confident, and calm.” Slowly, quietly, and with a feeling.
Three such “sittings” a day and one immediately before sleep made this woman a star-singer after only a week: she gave a remarkable, wonderful audition and she never felt the fear of being on stage ever again.
“Carry out the above procedure with assurance and conviction,” concludes Murphy, “and the death of fear is certain.”
Key Lessons from “The Miracles of Your Mind”
1.    Your Mind Has Two Distinct Phases: Objective and Subjective
2.    The Subconscious Mind Is Most Powerful When the Conscious Mind Is Switched Off
3.    The True Meaning of the Words “Heart” and “Lord”
Your Mind Has Two Distinct Phases: Objective and Subjective
Even though we have only one mind, it has “two distinct phases or functions.” These two functions have many names, but the ones Murphy prefers are objective (or conscious) and subjective (or subconscious).
The objective (or the conscious) mind, via our five senses, takes cognizance of the objective world; the subjective, on the other hand, is the seat of our emotions. The former gives orders and is limited by our senses; the latter is susceptible to suggestions and is superior in all aspects to the conscious mind. 
The Subconscious Mind Is Most Powerful When the Conscious Mind Is Switched Off
Just as the conscious mind works best when you are fresh and active, the subconscious mind works best when you are not, because that’s when the objective function of your brain is suppressed by your body.
That’s what happens when you’re drowsy or sleepy (this is when you’re most unable to discern reality from fantasy), so this is the best time to start 
 something to your subconscious mind. It is the time when it is most open to listening.
So make your pitch to it just before you fall asleep, in the quiet, relaxed, reverie-like state of lethargy.
The True Meaning of the Words “Heart” and “Lord”
“The heart is called the subconscious mind in ancient allegories,” writes Murphy. “The Egyptians knew that the heart was the subconscious mind, but they did not call it by that name. The Chaldeans and the Babylonians called it by different names.”
In addition, in the penultimate chapter of the book, Murphy adds that “the 
 is an ancient word meaning your subconscious mind.”
In other words, when you’re talking to your heart or the Lord, you’re actually talking to your subconscious mind. 
But that is not a mistake, because this is how your most intimate wishes actually come true. You just need to believe it—naively and with total dedication. It doesn’t matter what it is: faith opens the path to your subconscious mind, and it answers to many different names.

“The Miracles of Your Mind Quotes”
Our Critical Review
More or less, 
can be summed up in two sentences, and we really feel that Joseph Murphy is spinning them out in a book so that he can profit from selling it.
Which doesn’t mean that he doesn’t believe in his own philosophy. But it does mean that 
 don’t: 
seems to us quite unscientific and unempirical—even half-baked (there are so many examples here that we have no way of finding out whether they are invented or not).
Finally, even though it says it’s practical, there’s really nothing of that sort here: blame us for being conservative if you’d like, but it’s not that practical to expect to become rich by merely thinking about it three times a day. You need to work for it!However, if you appreciate the New Thought and the Human Potential Movement and its advocates, then this is a book you 
 to read. It’s a classic, and it will be for many years to come.

Thought Vibration Summary,https://blog.12min.com/thought-vibration-pdf-summary/,https://blog.12min.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image2-1-1.jpg,"11 min read ⌚ 
“Be careful what you wish for,” says an old adage, “because you might just get it.”
But what if this the Law which governs all the known and unknown Universe?
William Walker Atkinson claims this is the case in his 1906 classic:
Who Should Read “Thought Vibration”? And Why?
If you know what the New Thought and the Human Potential movements are about, then you probably know William Walker Atkinson, one of their earliest and foremost advocates.
If you don’t know him, then you have an even bigger reason to read 
: this is one of the books from which 
and 
 stem from.
About William Walker Atkinson
 was an American merchant, attorney, publisher and writer, one of the pioneers of the New Thought movement.
A prolific writer, he authored numerous books (possibly even more than a hundred), some other his own name, while others under his pseudonyms Theron Q. Dumont and Yogi Ramacharaka.
Still respected for their style and influence, some of his books (such as 
) have remained in print continuously for more than a century.
“Thought Vibration PDF Summary”
Dubbed by William James “the religion of healthy-mindedness” in his pioneering study 
,
New Thought was one of the very first spiritual movements developed on this side of the Atlantic, in the newly formed country of the United States.
The movement originated in the first decades of the 19
 century and is thought to have been derived from the unpublished works of Phineas Quimby, a mesmerist and inventor. 
By the beginning of the next century, when William Walker Atkinson became the editor of the popular 
magazine (December 1901), the movement was already a nationwide phenomenon. However, Atkinson became such a prominent member and advocate that today he is widely regarded as one of the creators and pioneers of the movement.
By 1901, Atkinson hadn’t published a single book, but during the next three decades (he died in 1932) he wrote and published at least one hundred.
Though quite short (no longer than 100 pages in any edition), 
is one of the most remarkable ones he ever penned, both in terms of sheer power and creativity. In essence, it says nothing that previous books on the subject hadn’t said (or modern “Law of Attraction” books haven’t copied), but it says it in so many beautiful and forceful sentences that it does look as if this must be the book where it all started.
We even feel kind of bad that we are unable to translate Atkinson’s style into our summary—after all, that may be this book’s best trait.
As for its ideas—let’s cast a cold eye on the main ones, mostly shared in the first few chapters.
William Walker Atkinson’s Working Creed
When Atkinson became the editor of 
, he made himself known to the readers in a memorable article titled “Working Creed.” Its power and status are such that this article is often included as a sort of an epigraph to 
(and many other books of Atkinson). 
It starts thus:
Atkinson goes on in this manner for another page or two, stating his belief in the Brotherhood of Man and being kind, in the Socratic notion that Evil is ignorance and to the Hinduist idea that “to the pure, all things are pure.”
“I believe that there is an Infinite Power in, and of, all things,” he concludes. “I believe that, although today we have but the faintest idea of that power, still we will steadily grow to comprehend it more fully—will get in closer touch with it. Even now we have momentary glimpses of its existence—a momentary consciousness of Oneness with the Absolute.”
“None can read the recurring, ringing ‘I believe’ of this author,” writes Franklin Barry in the 1906 “Preface” to 
,
“without feeling and sponsoring thrill of exaltation and power.” 
And, indeed, he seems about right.
What Are Thought Vibrations?
Most of what 
is about is stated in Atkinson’s working creed. However, he does know his way around with words and is able to spin this belief across many pages, speckling it with some formidable claims that are, at best, insulated from science, and, at worst, decidedly disputable and pseudo-scientific.
Atkinson is adamant that the Universe is governed by one great Law, only some of whose multiform manifestations are familiar to us. This Law is too inscrutable and ineffable to be pinned down into words, but we can get a glimpse of its inner workings through its most fascinating expressions among us. 
The Law of Gravitation is one of these, and the other, the one Atkinson wants to talk about, is the related Law of Attraction in the Thought World.
Atkinson writes: “We are familiar with that wonderful manifestation of Law which draws and holds together the atoms of which matter is composed—we recognize the power of the law that attracts bodies to the earth, that holds the circling worlds in their places—but we close our eyes to the 
”
As far as Atkinson is concerned, Thought is a force, a manifestation of Energy, a vibration sent through time and space—and is as real and as intangible as the “vibrations manifesting light, heat, electricity, magnetism.” The only difference between these vibrations is the rate of vibration—light and heat, for example, are manifested by vibrations of “a far lower intensity of Thought.” 
Before the invention of certain instruments, we couldn’t perceive (see, hear, smell, feel, taste) most of these vibrations, and yet we were able to observe a magnet attracting another magnet. Nowadays, however, we have the experiments, and we can measure the vibrations that interest us, and, moreover, predict and utilize their behaviors.
Well, it’s pretty much the same with thought vibrations. The unfortunate difference here is that the human brain is still the only instrument capable of both producing and registering thought-waves.
Atkinson does point out that he thinks humanity is on the brink of discovering “apparatus sufficiently delicate to catch and register” thought vibrations, but a century has passed since he uttered this claim, and as far as we know, such an instrument has not been discovered yet.
As for manifestations, Atkinsons says, there are many, highlighting practical experiments in telepathy as definite evidence of the existence of thought vibration and the validity of the law of attraction.
How Does the Law of Attraction Work in the Thought World?
Constantly and inevitably, our brain sends and receives thought vibrations. Moreover, unlike a magnet, it only receives the type of thoughts it sends.
In other words, if you send thought vibrations of love, you will attract the love thoughts of others; this will, in turn, stimulate you to start a journey along the path of love fulfillment, and you will start finding yourself in circumstances and surroundings in full accordance with your thought, and among people who love you back.
On the other hand, “thoughts of Anger, Hate, Envy, Malice and Jealousy will draw to us the foul brood of kindred thoughts emanating from the minds of others; circumstances in which we will be called upon to manifest these vile thoughts and will receive them in turn from others; people who will manifest inharmony.”
“Like attracts like in the Thought World,” writes Atkinson, “as ye sow so shall ye reap. Birds of a feather flock together in the Thought World—curses like chickens come home to roost, and bringing their friends with them.”
If you have problems understanding this, Atkinson advises you to start thinking of “the Marconi wireless instruments,” which is to say 
. When 
was published, this was something very new, but nowadays it is so old and outdated we don’t even have to tell you how radio works.
Simply put, a radio transmitter receives only those vibrations (from the thousands passing through the air) which are attuned to the same key. 
Well, the same law applies to how our thoughts work: “We receive only that which corresponds to our mental attunement.” Force yourself to change your attunement, and just like a radio transmitter, you should start receiving other types of vibrations.
This is why negative people see only negative things in the world and why positive people always see the glass half full.
The Secret of the Mind
“Man has but one mind,” writes Atkinson, “but he has many mental faculties, each faculty being capable of functioning along two different lines of mental effort. There are no distinct dividing lines separating the two several functions of a faculty, but they shade into each other as do the colors of the spectrum.”
An active effort of any of these faculties of the mind is the result of “a direct impulse imparted at the time of the effort.” In other words, an active effort is the thought vibrations you send, as governed by your will.
A passive effort, on the other hand, is the result of one of these things:
• a preceding active effort of the same mind;
• an active effort of another mind (along the lines of suggestion);
• a thought vibration from the mind of another; or
• a thought impulse from an ancestor, transmitted by the laws of heredity.
The active effort is always fresh and new: it 
 things; the passive effort, on the other hand, is the result of an active effort, and it does nothing but 
 orders and suggestions. It is only the active function which is capable of sending forth vibrations; the passive only receives them.
And this is the function you need to develop if you want to harness the power of your thoughts and not be the slave of someone else’s. 
The Secret of the Will
“When you feel led to yield to the calling of your lower nature,” Atkinson writes, “find a way to fix your mind on the Higher Self and draw inspiration from it.”
Here’s a technique that may help you.
When you feel vexed and cross and are tempted to burst into anger, assert the “I,” remember what you are and rise above your feeling.  
When you feel fearful, remember that the Real Self fears nothing and assert courage; in much the same manner, when you feel jealousy inciting, think of your higher nature and cast it aside by laughing.
All of these feelings are unworthy of you and must be taught to keep their places. Atkinson writes:
No matter what they teach you, your mind is amenable to your Will, which is “the outward manifestation of the 
 and is capable of attracting the Absolute.
It is here that the real power of man comes from: the awareness that the “I” is the sovereign of the mind and that everything bad is the result of mental misgovernment. Harness the power of your Will, and you will harness the power of your potential.
Here’s a great exercise described by Atkinson: just perform at least 
disagreeable task each day during a single month. 
“Anyone can do a pleasant thing cheerfully,” writes Atkinson, “but it takes Will to do the unpleasant thing cheerfully; and that is how you must do the work. It will prove a most valuable discipline to you. Try it for a month, and you will see where ‘it comes in.’”
If you are unable to do this, then 
is not for you: you do not have nor want Will Power, and are content to stay where you are and remain a weakling.
But you are more than that, aren’t you?
Key Lessons from “Thought Vibration”
1.      Thought Vibrations Are as Real as Heat or Light Vibrations
2.      The Active Part of the Mind Produces, and the Passive Mind Receives
3.      Like Attracts Like in the World of Thought
Thought Vibrations Are as Real as Heat or Light Vibrations
Ever since the dawn of times, a magnet was capable of attracting another magnet—but it took millennia for people to understand how.
Why?
Because they were unable to see the “vibrations” which cause the attraction.
Well, according to Atkinson, the same applies to thought vibrations as well: they 
exist,
and they 
 work, even though the only organ able to both produce and receive them is the mind.
“Like a stone thrown into the water,” Atkinson writes poetically, “thought produces ripples and waves which spread out over the great ocean of thought. There is this difference, however: the waves on the water move only on a level plane in all directions, whereas thought waves move in all directions from a common center, just as do the rays from the sun.”
The Active Part of the Mind Produces, and the Passive Mind Receives Thought Vibrations
Though we have only one mind, it can function at two different levels of mental endeavor: active and passive.
The active part of the mind is the one which produces these thought vibrations, the one powerful enough to throw a stone in the water.
The passive part of the mind, on the other hand, constantly receives other thought vibrations, some of them coming from the active part of the same mind, while others of other people or even ancestors.
Like Attracts Like in the World of Thought
It is important to know that the passive part of the mind works pretty much like a radio receiver: it doesn’t receive all the thought vibrations that are present in the air, but only the one attuned to its frequency.
Yup, you read that right: you can attune your mind to receive only certain kinds of thought vibrations.
And the best way to attune it is by producing thought vibration of the wished-for frequency. 
Put plainly, if you emit love, you’ll receive love; if you emit hate, hate is what you will get in return.

Our Critical Review
If you don’t think that 
is outdated, you should just spend a second of your time thinking about that Marconi radio reference or Atkinson’s belief that we are at the brink of discovering a thought-registering instrument.
However, unlike many other books which deal with the Law of Attraction, 
doesn’t sound that maudlin or naïve, courtesy of Atkinson’s powerful style.
For better or for worse, mainly because of it, his ideas reverberate in many of the books written today, even though scientists have repeatedly questioned them.We are not scientists, so we’ll let you be the judge: 
is a short book, and it will take you not more than two hours of your life. Read it for yourself, and see how much Atkinson was wrong or right. If the latter, you might have discovered a gem of a book.

Before technology made acquiring information super-easy, there were not many ways to do that: the classroom, the laboratory, the workshop, and, sometimes, out in the field. 
Either way, if you wanted to learn something, it required a lot of effort.
Nowadays, you can google absolutely anything you want and find out very specific info about your subject of interest in less than a few seconds—no matter where you are or what you are doing. 
You have not only Wikipedia in your pocket, but the sum of all knowledge available to humans: thought-provoking videos, 
 presentations, in-depth reviews, interesting analyses, captivating book summaries… everything!
And just until three or four decades ago, the only way you could look up for general info was inside an encyclopedia! And it was even more difficult than just opening a book!
First of all, encyclopedias that really mattered were not 300 pages long but spanned for more than twenty or thirty volumes. Consequently, very few people could afford them. So, you needed to go to the library and look for information there. And God forbid it was something recent: you could never find the title of Taylor Swift’s first album in 
!
“It almost feels like the dark ages when you realize how difficult it was to simply acquire knowledge and learn about what you’re interested in,” writes Peter Hollins at the beginning of

) is the educational system: it is still based on the traditional top-down learning model.
The problem?
In a traditional environment, you still learn what somebody else has decided that you should beforehand, be it your family, your private instructor, or, in most cases, a school board.
Not all of the aspects of these systems are negative, but many people have expressed the 
 of the traditional learning model, long before the advent of the Internet. Some of these guys you know quite well: Mark Twain, Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin.
In one way or another, these three were all autodidacts, i.e., people who were fully or partially self-taught in the arts and sciences they eventually mastered. A sort of Will Huntings of their days. 
You’d be surprised how many of your favorite authors (
, Borges, 
, Tagore), musicians (Bowie, Cobain, Hendrix), directors (Tarantino, Kubrick, Welles), and even inventors (Da Vinci, Tesla) were just that: curious people who learned all that they learned by themselves.
That is the essence of being an autodidact or a self-educator, both a teacher and a student at the same time. 
As you can see, self-learning is not a new pursuit. However, what’s new is how possible and attainable it is nowadays. “Courtesy of the Internet, the world is your oyster,” writes Hollins, “and we have the ability to learn anything we want these days.”
So that we can achieve this, first we must take a cue from the autodidacts of the past and understand the different mindset which makes self-learning possible.
The Learning Success Pyramid
To sum up, traditional learning is nothing more but a combination of reading and regurgitation. Self-learning is something more: a process of self-directed growth via profound intellectual curiosity.
Understandably, however, self-learning isn’t a mode operated by a switch that you can just flick on. Before you start educating yourself, you need to “put some mental and emotional groundwork in place to prepare for success.”
Legendary college basketball coach 
 can help you with that. His “pyramid of success” brilliantly structures the 15 stages (or blocks) one needs to pass on the course to success in his/her personal and practical ventures.
Educator Susan Kruger used Wooden’s pyramid as the foundation for something much more relevant in our case: 
. Much like Wooden’s diagram, Kruger’s pyramid identifies “the necessary elements one must bring to ensure accomplishment in learning throughout their life.” Unlike Wooden, Kruger kept the number of blocks to 3:
• Confidence
• Self-management
• Learning
This is how Hollins sums up the descriptions of these three stages:
Related to Kruger’s second block (self-management) is another essential prerequisite of self-learning: self-motivation. Since you are both a teacher and a student, without it, you won’t be able to move forward through your life.
, Hollins reminds us that there are three main aspects of self-motivation: autonomy, mastery, and purpose/impact. “The intangibles,” says Hollins, “tend to be far more powerful than what you would traditionally consider motivating.”
Interaction and Information
Now that you know the basics of self-learning, it’s time that Hollins shares with you a few techniques to help you on your journey to mastery. 
Learn them, and use them as often as you can, and you’ll be able to get the most out of anything you read, hear, or see.
Introduced by American educational philosopher and psychologist Francis P. Robinson in his 1948 book 
¸ the SQ3R method is one of the most powerful tools in a self-learner toolkit.
Developed specifically with comprehension in mind, the SQ3R method makes reading and observing a much more active process, creating dynamic engagements between readers and books which allow for the information acquired to get stuck in a reader’s mind.
The name of the technique is an acronym of its five components: 
. Let’s have a look at all of them
The first step in the SQ3R method aims to help you get a general overview of what you 
 be reading. We italicized the “will” for a reason: as tempting as it is, don’t start reading before you survey your reading material. 
This step shouldn’t take long: 3 to 5 minutes is all it should take you to go through the contents of a single book and take note of the headings and the sub-headings. 
“It’s just like taking a look at the entire map before you set off on a road trip,” writes Hollins smartly. “You may not need all the knowledge at the moment, but understanding everything as a whole and how it fits together will help you with the small details and when you’re in the weeds.”
Even in the second stage of the SQ3R method, “you’re still not diving into the deep end.” As suggested by its name, this stage is reserved for inquiries and questions. 
What kind of questions?
Simple, general. You can just ask yourself, “What this chapter is about?” or convert the titles of the headings into questions: “Who is Peter Hollins?” Once again, this is a short 3-to-5-minutes stage, but it is essential: it is through these questions that you’re waking up your curiosity, an autodidact’s best trait.
Now you can begin reading—and reading actively. You’re not just reading something distant at this point, but you’re treading familiar ground, trying to find answers to the questions you posed in #2. There’s a big difference: you’ve just turned your reading from passive into active.
The only way you’d know if you have actually remembered something of the things you’ve read is if you test yourself. See how much of what you’ve read you can retrieve from memory. Try to answer the questions posited in #2.
It is of vital importance that you formulate and conceptualize the learned material in your very own words. Act as if you’re a teacher standing in front of a group of children, if it helps. 
The final stage of the SQ3R method is reviewing. It is a variant of retrieving: saying back to yourself what the point of a passage, a page, or a chapter was.
Bertrand Russell claims that there is not a big difference between reading without taking notes, and not reading.
So, if you are one of those who don’t want to put any marks on the margin of a page, try to change that about yourself immediately: this may be the reason why you’re never able to remember the things you’ve read.
Fortunately, however, most of us 
 take notes when reading; unfortunately, it seems that very few take them in the right manner.
Devised by Walter Pauk, an education professor at Cornell, the Cornell note-taking system has been scientifically proven to work wonders in terms of efficiency, tidiness, and memorization. And you need nothing more than a reorganization of 
you take the notes.
And it is quite simple: you just divide the list into two unequal columns (the right one about twice the size of the left one) and leave about 2 inches (5 cm) at the bottom of the page.
Now, in the right column, you put the notes, in the left you put the keywords related to the notes, and in the space on the bottom, a summary of what you’ve learned.
In case you have problems visualizing this, here’s a short video to help you better understand what Cornell Notes are:
Read Faster and Retain More
In the third part of his book, Peter Hollins demonstrates some simple—but very effective—speed-reading tactics, which we can sum up in four actionable pieces of advice:
• 
. The obvious and self-explanatory one. Subvocalizing is defocusing and slows you quite a bit. If you are doing it, it’s time you stopped;
• 
. 
, you’ve got to train yourself to read faster. And the best part of your body to start training is your eyes: the less they slide away from the page, the faster you’ll be able to read. 
• 
. Slow readers read linearly, but fast readers read diagonally. Learn to strategically skim the pages where the main topics are merely introduced, or some marginals topics are discussed.
• 
. 
However, Peter Hollins is adamant that speed-reading is not enough (or even the right way to go). If you want to retain more and actually grow as a self-learner, you need to learn how to read properly, regardless of your speed. 
He shares nothing new here—he merely advises his readers to buy that brilliant Mortimer & Adler classic, 
—and reminds us of the four levels of reading:
• 
: how you probably read right now;
• 
: when you start wondering what it is precisely what you’re reading;
• 
: when you start taking Cornell notes;
• 
: when you start comparing the acquired information with other books on the same topic.
The difference between traditional and self-learning is basically the difference between the first and the other three levels of reading; becoming an autodidact is all about becoming a syntopical reader.
After all, at school, nobody teaches you to start asking questions about what you’re reading: if anything, they teach you the opposite. Autodidacts don’t think that way: they actively search for meaning—both in the texts they read, and, more importantly, in the lives they lead.
Key Lessons from “The Science of Self-Learning”
1.      Traditional Learning is an Outdated Model
2.      Self-Learning Is Not a New Concept—But It Is Made for Our Times
3.      Use the SQ3R and Cornell Notes Method to Read and Retain Better
Traditional Learning is an Outdated Model
Now, don’t get us wrong: learning in a classroom comes with a lot of benefits. The problem is this traditional learning model has negatives as well, some of them even quite obvious.
For example, in traditional learning, you’ll always learn what somebody else somewhere (your family, your private tutor, a school board) has decided is best for you to know.
In addition, traditional learning is psychologically restrictive, since instead of arousing, it stifles curiosity in children, who are specifically taught 
to question what they are required to learn.
Self-Learning Is Not a New Concept—But It Is Made for Our Times
Not only due to the reasons pointed out above, self-learning has been advocated by great minds ever since the Renaissance. 
In self-learning, you are your own teacher and student: it is you who makes the syllabus and you who must adhere to it, you who make and grade the tests.
Da Vinci, Tesla, Hesse, Twain—these were all autodidacts or self-learners, meaning, they all managed to excel in the field of their choice without a teacher. And they did it at a time when there was no Wikipedia and no YouTube.
If it ever made sense for people to become self-learners, now is that time. In other words, if you are using all these modern technological benefits to instead of exploring the world around you—then you’re missing out on quite a lot!
Use the SQ3R and Cornell Notes Method to Read and Retain Better
Though quite simple, the SQ3R method and the Cornell note-taking system should help you read better and remember things longer.
SQ3R stands for survey, question, read, retrieve, review—which is how you should approach every single book you’ll ever read. You should also use the Cornell note-taking system to organize your knowledge better while you acquire it.

Tired of dieting and strict exercising routines?
What if we told you that you don’t need them—and that you’d still live a happier, healthier life?
As Rebecca Scritchfield says, what you really need is quite simple:

Who Should Read “Body Kindness”? And Why?
If you want to live a happier, healthier life, but you are tired of ads and magazines that promote unattainable body images, 
is the book for you.
Primarily intended for women, it can be read by men as well, mainly because it repeatedly insists on finding ways to inspire the readers to make their own programs.
Coaches and nutritionists should find something interesting here as well.

“Body Kindness PDF Summary”
Diets, exercising, supplements… They are, undeniably, all good for your looks, physical health, and your overall fitness if you want to 
, but how good are they for your mental health?
Rebecca Scritchfield thinks that, in the case of too many people, when all is taken into account, they do more harm than good, simply because, just like everything else in this world, our bodies crave for 
.
And that word is the key one in the question that opens Scritchfield’s most celebrated book and underlies her whole philosophy: “what would you do if you treated your body with kindness?”
Pause for a moment here and try to answer this question in a thought-out and honest manner.
Done that?
Now, you can proceed.
The Philosophy of Body Kindness
As you might have guessed, Scritchfield frequently poses the question above to her clients, colleagues, friends, family, and anyone else willing to ponder it.
And according to her, in the span of many years, nobody has ever said that “doing punishing workout to alleviate cheesecake guilt is a good example of proper self-care.” 
We guess nobody says that eating a bag of nacho cheese Doritos every night can be classified as body kindness as well.
Which brings us to one very important conclusion: “everyone has a gut instinct for how to be kind to their body.” The reason is quite simple: 
 to notice when things are not going as planned.
You can lie to yourself as much as you want to, but the truth is you know full well when you’re unkind to your body. And the body, we don’t need to remind you, 
forgets.
Unfortunately, what people often forget is that being healthy is not the same as being fit. It can be, but not necessarily. You can have cellulite and thick thighs and be healthy nevertheless.
Also, being 
 healthy is only a part of the equation. If diets make you anxious and angry, then you’re only caring for half of your health. Emotional health is a very important part of the “being well” equation.
Why do we ignore it so much?
Well, this is the essence of the philosophy of body kindness: dieting and exercising are not ways to achieve the perfect body, but tools that should help you feel good about yourself:
The Three Pillars and the Three Objectives of Body Kindness
Many women are slaves to the “joyless myth” that unless they like what they see in the mirror, they can never be happy.
Consequently, the only reason why they work out or diet is precisely that: to obtain a body like those magazine models everyone talks about—
 
 (and this is the scary part) they have quite healthy and happy lives with the bodies they have before.
The 
 of the body kindness movement aim to change this. All of them are verbs meant to serve as guideposts on one’s journey to better health and happiness:
 
“Health grows from love,”
writes
Scritchfield. The very reason why you know you’re not doing a good thing munching ice-cream in bed is because you know, under the surface, that you are built and willing to love yourself. Cherish and develop this love. 
When you notice a friend torturing herself through dieting and exercising, your instinct is to tell her that she needs to stop doing that to herself. Well, start connecting to yourself like you are to your friends, and allow your body to guide your choices.
You express love and connection through caring. Show your body that you care. Act in a way that’s quietly saying: “We’re in this together. I’m your friend, not your enemy.”
Dedicated to shattering the mirror-myth mentioned at the beginning of this section, the Body kindness program (let’s call it that way, even though it’s not that strict) sets before itself 
:
 
 “You are free to make your own choices instead of following meaningless rules,” writes Scritchfield. “You can stop overthinking and use your energy for interests other than preconceived notions of health and appearance.”
. If the organs inside your body start warring between themselves, you wouldn’t be able to function properly, to say the least. Then why are you waging war against them, against your body, against yourself? End it. Start living more authentically.
. People who are insecure follow trends. People who are confident make up their own rules. Being kind to your body will empower you to set yourself profound and meaningful goals, because, after all, you are in charge of your life.
Food Rules Suck: Eating with Body Kindness
Now that we’ve gone over the theory, let’s see how body kindness works in practice. Unsurprisingly, diets are the best place to start: it’s a billion-dollar industry, and it affects just about every woman you know (and don’t know).
But here’s the catch: since it doesn’t take mental and emotional health in the equation, dieting, by definition, is based on a paradox.
And (as you know from 80% of the people who’ve tried it) it rarely works.
It’s true that some nourishments are healthier than others and that some don’t even deserve to be called that way because they are nothing more than junk food.
The problem is that trying to avoid the ones that are unhealthy for you usually results in so much anxiety and repressed emotions that, by trying to fix your physical health, you’re ruining your mental and emotional health.
And it’s not only that the ones who are anxious are unhappy; it’s also that the unhappy cannot keep up long with a routine. 
So, to sum up: by being overly controlling of what you eat and what you don’t you do get better physically in the short run; but you also get anxious and unhappy, which, in the long run, backfires even in the physical department.
Yup, we’re talking about the day when, after two months of avoiding cupcakes, you ate a whole box of them!
There’s a simple way out: balance things out.
Stop following strict rules and allow yourself moderate indulgence once a day. Don’t just give up bread altogether: start eating bread more rarely.
It’s a marathon, not a sprint. You’re in it for the long run.
Fitness for 
Life: Choose What Works for You
There are thousands of exercising regimes you can find online or in any of the thousands of magazines dedicated to fitness and health. The problem is, most of them don’t work. Or, to be more precise, most of them 
.
Now, don’t get us wrong: exercising is very good for you and your health. In fact, it’s one of the best ways to express kindness to your body.
Whether you’re fighting depression or diabetes, or you simply want to reduce the risk of severe diseases such as cancer or heart disease, exercising does wonders.
The problem is very few people actually exercise.
The stats say that the average American moves about for no more than 20 minutes a day and that a third of Americans exercises once a week 
.
The reason why this is so despite the benefits of regular exercise is that it is difficult to find the motivation to work out in a world where every second counts. Especially since the 
 benefits of exercising can only become evident in the long run.
So, Rebecca Scritchfield advises you to do four things.
First of all, you’ll need to throw away all those fitness magazines and stop comparing yourself to Victoria’s Secret models. Chances are you’ll never live up to these images, and unachievable goals demotivate.
Secondly, you need to find the right motivation. Maybe this one will do: exercising a little every day may not chisel you into a Kardashian or a Beyoncé, but it will undoubtedly help you feel better and live longer.
Thirdly, you need to find a friend or a coach. We sometimes need external motivation and friends and coaches are just that (remember: connect). You don’t need a coach to get great (
): you need it to get a routine.
Finally, just like with dieting, you need to find a program that works for you. Don’t do things you can do only for a day. Do things you’re ready to do for life. Because, after all, it is 
Sleep: The Secret Superpower for Spiraling Up
Arianna Huffington practically stopped doing everything she was doing a few years ago to warn the world that it needs a little rest, and to start something she deemed a 
.
She was on track: the majority of people, unfortunately, do not get enough sleep on a daily basis. The effects are frightening—especially in the long run.
Science is still unsure as to why we sleep (let alone dream), but it has the general idea. If nothing more, it is quite sure that it has something to do with memory and learning, because studies have repeatedly shown that people deprived of enough sleep memorize (and know) less than people who get a good eight-hour sleep.
It could be that sleep works as a sort of a “save and declutter” button on our bodies. Just think how much easier it is to live in your apartment when your dishes are done, when your clothes are in the wardroom, and when everything else is in its place. 
Well, in a way, sleep is your body’s 
: it sparks joy.
Now, there are 
, and some (not more than 5% though) can function perfectly even after a 6-hour sleep. Most of us, however, are genetically predisposed to sleep about 8 hours or four 2-hour sleep cycles.
To achieve this, you need to do a few things.
First of all, turn your bedroom into a “sleeping sanctuary.” That means no TV, no laptops, and no smartphones. It may be difficult at first, but you’ll get used to it. Do it long enough, and sometime in the future, you’ll thank Scritchfield for suggesting this.
Secondly, make sure that your bed is clean, comfortable, and always ready to take you in. That means: 
, wash your sheets regularly, and invest in a good mattress.
Finally, make your own sleep routine. Go to bed at a certain hour of the night (about one hour after using an electronic device for the last time), and learn to wake up eight hours after that. Your body wants that and, as proof, after some time, you won’t need an alarm to wake up. 
And you’ll wake up refreshed and ready to conquer the world—on a daily basis.
That’s how our body rewards for being kind to it.
Key Lessons from “Body Kindness”
1.      The Philosophy of Body Kindness
2.      The Three Pillars and the Three Objectives of Body Kindness
3.      The Four Principles of Body Kindness
The Philosophy of Body Kindness
According to Rebecca Scritchfield (masochists aside, we suppose?), each of us has an instinctive urge to be kind to his/her body. That is why we can’t bear dieting or exercise following strict regimes. They may help us physically, but they ruin us mentally and emotionally, and that is even unhealthier.
That is the essence of the “body kindness” philosophy: be kind to your body if you want your body to be kind to you.
The Three Pillars and the Three Objectives of Body Kindness
The philosophy of body kindness is founded on three actionable pillars.
First of all, you need to nurture the innate love you have for your body. Secondly, you need to connect to it as if it is your best friend. Finally, you need to care for it just like you would for your best friend whom you love so much.
Do this long enough, and you’ll achieve the three objectives of the “body kindness” program.
First of all, you’ll be free from the burden of “the image in the mirror.” This will allow you to be peaceful and happier. Finally, it will contribute to you being a much more confident person, and that is the final step toward breaking the “follow this/follow that rule” cycle.
The Four Principles of Body Kindness
The full body kindness program is based on four principles:
• 
: what you eat, how you exercise, how much you sleep;
• 
: befriending your emotions and shushing down the voice in your head;
• 
: what are your goals and your personal values and how do they align; and
• 
: how you can find your tribe, the people around whom you can be your best.
Five Things You Can Do to Spread Body Kindness to the World
This is the final lesson the author shares in the book, so we decided to make it our final lesson as well:
#1. Talk about more profound things than your or someone else’s appearance. When you have the chance, try inspiring your friends and your family to make positive choices.
#2. “Care about yourself enough to not care that much.” In other words—to hell with other people’s judgments. Love, connect and care.
#3. Be brave. Share your “body kindness” story with the ones you love.
#4. Vote with your dollar, i.e., support the communities and business that make room for the majority of people in their definitions of health and beauty.
#5. Build a strong tribe.

Even though your parents couldn’t care less about them, nowadays, exercising and dieting are multi-billion-dollar industries. 
Whether it’s personal trainers or gym memberships, fitness videos or bodybuilding magazines, weightlifting gears or diet supplements—most of the people you know have probably spent at least a hundred dollars during the last month only.
And probably you are not the exception.
There’s one problem with the market, though. In order to go on making money, the people who sell you stuff that makes them rich are intrinsically motivated 
to help you. Because if they do—i.e., if some of their “get fitter” programs actually work—then everybody is just going to stop paying them.
This is what Michael Matthews, the author of

), noticed early on in his bodybuilding career. “Every time you buy one of the big bodybuilding magazines,” he writes now, “you’re paying to be lied to.”
How does he know that?
Because he tried everything and, after nothing worked, he tried reading books written by scientists. And he found out something that not many people in the industry would like to share with you.

After all, even though (as we explain in “Our Critical Review”), the science behind Chopra and Tanzi’s advice seems suspicious (to say the least), the advice itself is pretty commonsensical and can undoubtedly contribute to one’s health.
However, be wary: it is still a medicinal book not really endorsed by most members of the medical community.

. 
Those familiar with either of these two books already know the basics of Tanzi and Chopra’s approach: combining New Age mysticism with the latest advancements in medicine, the pair proposes a holistic theory of human wellbeing, according to which the distinction between organs and emotions, between physical and spiritual aspects of our existence, is not only exaggerated by scientists – if not completely wrong – but also 
 to our health.
In other words, even the most severe mental diseases (such as Alzheimer’s) can be prevented (even 
) via some adjustments in our lifestyles – from diet to relationships – and even the strangest spiritual beliefs can have positive effects on your health.
is divided into two parts, the first of which deals with the more academic aspects of Chopra and Tanzi’s theory (coupled with case studies and anecdotes), while the second is much more actionable and offers a 7-day action plan.
Part One: The Healing Journey
Chopra and Tanzi’s approach described in the intro above is often called in literature the 
but the authors prefer the simpler 
 which, in a single word, sums up its essence: “body and mind are one domain, and every organ, tissue, and cell works toward the same goal: sustaining life.”
According to the authors, this approach is neither mysterious nor unscientific, but, on the contrary, much closer to nature, since nature doesn’t take into consideration human-made categories.
The bodymind approach to health, they say, “looks beyond the artificial medical-school divisions into separate organs and the old skepticism about the mind-body connection:”
“When a happy event occurs, such as falling in love, the whole system responds as messages course through the bloodstream, central nervous system, and immune system,” they write. “When a tragic event occurs like losing a loved one, the response is just as holistic, but the combination of chemicals in the signaling process is very different. What you experience subjectively as love or grief must have a precise configuration in the bodymind. If that didn’t exist, you wouldn’t have the experience.”
Now, modern medicine is skeptical of this bodymind approach. However, it’s not like it has all the answers. In fact, as Chopra and Tanzi point out, it has very few answers and it’s nothing short of a gambling model bound for breakdown at one point or another.
For example, we don’t know why specific causes for certain diseases like a cold virus only make 
 number of people sick – not everyone. And we don’t know why the same therapy works for some people, while not in the case of others.
Medicine almost never predicts what precisely will happen to the individual – it only speaks in percentages and possibilities. “There will always be someone who does everything right but gets sick anyway, while someone else who has paid almost no attention to their health dodges the bullet.”
There are seven reasons why it’s almost inevitable that one day, through no fault of your own, medical care would stop working for you:
• The doctor doesn’t know what caused you to get sick.
• There’s no drug or surgery that will resolve the situation.
• The available treatments are too risky, toxic, expensive, or all three.
• The side effects of the treatment outweigh the benefits.
• Your condition is too far advanced to be reversed.
• You’re too old to treat safely or with much hope of recovery.
• Somewhere along the line, a doctor made a mistake.
When any of these breakdowns occur, whatever happens next is out of your doctor’s control. After “three centuries of scientific medicine making huge strides,” somehow, we’re still suffering from some strange medical situations in the present:
• An estimated 400,000 people die every year due to medical mistakes.
• People are living longer and yet on average suffer about a decade of bad health and one to three years of disability at the end.
• Two-thirds of cancers are preventable – and yet, cancer is still approached “with grim fatalism.”
• For some reason, “the average person feels helpless, confused, and anxious about getting sick and going to the doctor.
It’s obvious “the gambling model for staying healthy needs to be replaced.” But why should the bodymind approach be the replacement?
In July 2017, a “startling medical story” hit the Internet: 24 experts on old-age dementia concluded that one-third of dementia cases 
be prevented.
How, when no known medicine exists? Through some simple lifestyle changes, with a different focus at a different stage of life.
“To reduce the risk,” the study said, “factors that make a difference include getting an education (staying in school until over the age of fifteen); reducing high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes; avoiding or treating hearing loss in mid-life; not smoking; getting physical exercise; and reducing depression and social isolation later in life.”
Of course, one item stands out even if you merely scan the paragraph above: staying in school until over the age of 15. 
How is it possible that 
affects old-age dementia, you ask?
Well, that’s what made this medical story “startling”: it was (in Chopra and Tanzi’s words) “a tip-of-the-iceberg story” since it uncovered something that medical researchers have been dabbling in for quite some time – 
.
It’s, in short, a fancy name for the finding that diseases start and can be prevented long before their symptoms appear. In the case above, staying at school until at least after your 15
 year means building up a “cognitive reserve” in your brain that counters Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia because it allows your brain some extra neural paths to follow if some grow weak or diseased:
So far so good: the earlier you start leading a proper life, the lesser the risk of contracting any kind of disease when you’re older. Nothing mystical about that, right?
However, as you might have deduced from the first section of our summary, Deepak Chopra and Rudolph Tanzi don’t stop there: they think that there’s a DNA-based reason for this connection and that it can be explained away by a simple “leap of imagination.”
Namely, according to them, DNA doesn’t change as slow as modern medicine would have us believe. AS the two argued in 
 DNA is, in fact, something dynamic and ever-changing, something “totally responsive to a person’s lifetime of experience.” 
Because of this, Chopra and Tanzi believe that it is possible to supercharge your immunity, that is, to boost your body’s innate immune response to external and internal attackers via your own conscious effort. It might sound sci-fi, but if you combine the way vaccines work with the bodymind connection, then it might seem a bit less strange.
After all, what vaccines do is somewhat similar to 
: they expose you to external attackers in small amounts, and your body is prepared to deal with them in the future if they happen to come at full force. 
However, until just a few years ago, modern medicine thought of the immune system as something isolated; studies such as the one published in 2017 reveal that we should stop thinking of our immune response in this manner. To make their case, Chopra and Tanzi introduce two new concepts: “total immunity” and “the healing self.”
“Total immunity is the measure of holistic health,” they write, describing it as the full-body response to health risks, mind included. After all, the mind obviously has some effect on health, and the same holds true about the behavior, habits, and the contribution of one’s family.
To make the above clearer, they use the term “the healing self” which, according to them, satisfies “the real meaning of wholeness.” 
 merges the healer and the healed, turning a patient into a doctor long before a disease ever becomes apparent:
These are some of the benefits of the healing self:
• It is noninvasive.
• It involves no reliance on external therapies.
• It maintains natural balance.
• It boosts your immune system through lifestyle choices (which, in turn, can prevent many forms of cancer and hold promise for preventing Alzheimer’s disease and even reversing symptoms of dementia).
• When the healing self is taken into consideration, aging can become a combination of both 
 as well as 
 and not only the latter.
• Drug dependency is staved off because healing occurs before the stage of symptoms begins. (“The vast majority of drugs are prescribed late in the disease process, a stage you don’t have to reach if you act early enough. This is true for almost every lifestyle disorder, including heart disease and cancer, disorders that create the strongest need for drug treatments.”)
“The healing self is the choice maker who steps into the arena of everyday life and steers mind and body toward a lasting healing response,” Chopra and Tanzi write. “A paper cut goes away after a day or two; last winter’s cold is a distant memory. The healing self, on the other hand, is long range. You set out to become whole, which is the only viable strategy for remaining healthy over a lifetime.”
When a person falls in love, to recommend inside their body. For one, some brain neurochemicals (such as dopamine and serotonin) increase, and the same happens with hormones such as FSH (the follicle-stimulating hormone) and cortisol.
Even so, “despite the undoubted experience of falling in love at first sight and abundant evidence that love creates powerful physiological changes, the whole phenomenon remains mysterious,” write Chopra and Tanzi.
What’s not mysterious, however, is that all of these physiological changes are beneficial to your health: you probably need no studies cited (and there are many) to know, from personal experience, that people in love are less depressed and less prone to stress. But let us go a step further: less anxiety also means fewer chronic inflammations. And fewer chronic inflammations decrease the risk of Alzheimer’s, heart disease and diabetes.
You’ve heard that right: love cures the heart much more literally than modern medicine would have you believe. This is how the bodymind works, the idea of the whole-body incarnate. Or as Chopra and Tanzi write:
As strange as the above might sound to you, one simple word might make you think it over: 
.
Not even the most rigid scientists would question 
 it works; on the contrary, ever since first observed, the only question modern medicine is dealing with concerning placebo is 
it works. And, according to Chopra and Tanzi, the reason why we still don’t have the answer is that most scientists are unwilling to admit that some intangibles (they call them the Factor X) affect a health treatment.
Alia Crum, “a Stanford psychologist who led a 2017 study calling for more research into the nonphysical aspect of healing,” is not one of these scientists and states the issues as clearly as possible: “We have long been mystified by the placebo effect,” she is quoted saying by the authors. “But the placebo effect isn’t some mysterious response to a sugar pill. It is the robust and measurable effect of three components: the body’s natural ability to heal, the patient mindset, and the social context. When we start to see the placebo effect for what it really is, we can stop discounting it as medically superfluous and can work to deliberately harness its underlying components to improve health care.”
Chopra and Tanzi believe that the reason why some medicines work only to a certain extent is that some people are their own placebos (i.e., they believe that they can be healed) while others don’t. They write:
The good news is that the process of transforming your beliefs in the direction of healing isn’t mysterious. Tanzi and Chopra offer seven steps that should help break down your negative beliefs step by step. Allow us to quote them in full:
1. When you catch yourself saying anything that’s negative, ask, “Is this really true?” Exposing an automatic reflex to rational questioning is an important step in letting go of it.
2. When you start to examine a negative belief that has come up, ask, “Is this really helping me?”
3. Be detached from the negative beliefs of others—secondhand infection happens frequently.
4. For every negative belief you expose, offer yourself two positive beliefs.
5. Journal about your journey of self-exploration. Write down any changes in your belief system that you see are happening, or simply that you want to happen.
6. Spend more time with supportive, loving, inspiring, and generally positive people. Avoid the opposite kind of people.
7. Value the whole project of self-care and increasing your state of well-being.
Part Two: Healing Is Now
As we mentioned in the introduction, the second part (and the second half, as well) of 
is a 7-day action plan. Here are its highlights. (By the way, bear in mind that you don’t need to do everything listed every day—choosing one and sticking to it on a weekly basis is more than enough.)
Monday is entirely about improving your diet.
So, add some anti-inflammatory foods to it, such as berries, seeds, soy, garlic and ginger, whole grains, tree nuts, etc. Also, add some organic foods and increase the fiber in your diet. Take a probiotic supplement, and switch to olive or saffron oil. Drink coffee 1 to 5 times a day, preferably at the heavier end.
At the same time, cut down sharply on your sugar intake. Cut out junk food and fast food. Throw out stale food, including stale cooking oils and leftovers more than a day old. Reduce overall fat and salt intake. Needless to add, eliminate alcohol altogether.
Tuesday is about reducing stress.
And you know how you can do that: do yoga, meditation, and practice mindful breathing and being centered. 
At the same time, try to walk away from stress as soon as possible, while refraining from ignoring stressful events in your life. On the contrary, make some time to examine a problem you have been putting up with out of frustration. Finally, turn irregular habits into a regular routine—discipline always helps when stress is in question.
Wednesday is about adding years to your life and life to your years.
To do so, join a social support group and strengthen emotional bonds with family and close friends. If you are age sixty-five or older, take a multivitamin and mineral supplement. Maintain a balance of rest and activity. Explore a new interest. Take up a challenging mental activity.
Whatever you do, don’t be sedentary—stand up and move throughout the day. Examine your negative emotions. Heal injured relationships that are meaningful to you. Be mindful of lapses and imbalances in your diet. Address negative stereotypes about aging and ageism. Consider how to heal the fear of death.
If you are working at the computer or at a desk job, stand up and move at least once an hour and walk five minutes for each hour you work. Take the stairs, not the elevator. Park your car far from your home and your office door. Spend more time with a physically active friend or family member. Walk for 20 to 30 minutes in the evening. 
Replace 10 minutes of sofa time in front of the TV with a walk instead. Break the habit of waiting until the weekend to catch up on lost sleep. If you drink alcohol, do it early in the evening—go to bed without alcohol in your bloodstream. Replace the midmorning coffee-and-doughnut break with a walk. Finally, examine your excuses for not being more active.
Write down five core beliefs and evaluate why you believe them. Put a core belief into action. Read a poem, scripture, or spiritual passage for inspiration. Have a family discussion about which core beliefs everyone holds. Take your favorite role model and list what core beliefs they held.
On the other hand, use Friday to also examine your negative beliefs as they relate to fear and mistrust. Open a line of communication with someone who holds radically different values. If you are stuck on a negative belief, be a devil’s advocate and argue against it. End your participation in us-versus-them thinking.
The “do’s” for this day include taking an allowing attitude, approaching a situation without resistance, acting gracefully, and sharing responsibility, while encouraging areas of flow.
The “undo’s” from which you should choose are: letting someone else have their way, helping reduce an area of conflict, stop resisting where you don’t need to, and remove obstacles from someone else’s path. Also, try to ease competition in favor of cooperation.
Finally, Sunday is about evolving.
Do’s: be on the lookout for synchronicity (meaningful coincidences); change your daily narrative for the better; look for a chance to be compassionate; openly express love and appreciation; be generous of spirit.
Undo’s: resist the voice of fear; if you find yourself expecting the worst, step away from that expectation and remain neutral; if you have a negative thought that keeps returning, ask if it is truly serving you or is a relic of the past; if you feel emotionally upset, find a quiet place to become more calm and centered; finally, seek the company of people who inspire and uplift you.
Key Lessons from “The Healing Self”
1.      Chronic Disorders Begin Long Before the First Symptoms
2.      The Healing Self and the Bodymind
3.      The Factor X: Your Background, Love, Belief, Mindfulness
Chronic Disorders Begin Long Before the First Symptoms
Believe it or not, people who stay in school to the age of 15 are 8% less likely to get Alzheimer’s than those who don’t. The lesson: you can cure some diseases long before they become manifest in any observable way.
“Perhaps the major medical breakthrough of our time,” writes Maria Shriver, the founder of The Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement, in a review of 
,
“is the discovery that most, if not all, chronic disorders begin years earlier than the first symptoms. We’ve learned that about Alzheimer’s — that it’s 20 years in the making. 
 reminds us how important it is that we care for our brains and our bodies at the earliest stage possible.”
The Healing Self and the Bodymind
According to Deepak Chopra and Rudolph Tanzi, science has artificially cut the umbilical cord between the mind and the body when things such as one’s health and immunity are in question.
In reality, they say, nature doesn’t care about categorization and is absolutely disinterested in the different sections of a medical handbook. The mind and the body are connected – quite literally, through many neurotransmitters – which means that you can influence your health through your mind in a much more tangible manner than modern medicine believes.
That’s why they use the term bodymind to speak of the wholeness of a human being, in addition to the term the healing self to express our body’s capability to take on both roles of the healing process: the healer and the healed.
The Factor X: Your Background, Love, Belief, Mindfulness
Whenever you’ve been prescribed a certain therapy, your doctor merely bets on a certain outcome based on previous studies and experiences. However, nobody knows why some therapies work in some cases and don’t work in others.
Tanzi and Chopra deem the difference the Factor X and think that it has to have a lot with the ignored bodymind connection and the wholeness of our experiences. In short, if you live a calm life filled with love and friends, if you meditate and eat healthily and if you believe that something will turn out for the best—therapies should not only work but should become obsolete.
Do the opposite, and after a certain point, no therapy will make you healthy ever again.

“The Healing Self Quotes”
Our Critical Review
As we wrote in the “Who Should Read This Book” section above, 
seems sound in terms of the validity of its pieces of advice, but a bit far-fetching in terms of the science explaining them.
In other words, while we’d warmly recommend the second part of the book to anyone who wishes to live a healthier and happier life, we really don’t think that anyone should consider this book as scientific when, by its own admission, it requires “a leap of imagination” to be fully grasped.
Science is precisely the opposite—knowledge that can be backed by experiments and experience—and uses imagination only to hypothesize. And we kind of feel that Tanzi and Chopra take their hypotheses at face value without ever proving them.
Moreover, we believe that the note “We certainly aren’t advising you to ignore or avoid a physician’s care when it is needed” shouldn’t be put merely in parenthesis in the “Introduction,” but should be the first sentence in almost all of the chapters from Part One.But, then again, that’s only our opinion. Our hope, interestingly, is that Tanzi and Chopra are actually right and that there are such things as 
 and 
. If so, life would be much easier, and hospitals won’t be necessary in the future. For now, the opposite is true.

People are either Red, Yellow, Blue or Green. 
And we’re not quoting a newly found CCR song or talking about political parties—these are the four behavior types according to Swedish communication expert Thomas Erikson.
Find out more about each of them in our summary of his runaway bestseller:
Who Should Read “Surrounded by Idiots”? And Why?
is justly marketed as the perfect book for human resource workers and managers: if you are one, Erikson’s bestseller will undoubtedly help you categorize the employees you’re in charge of into easily manageable categories.
However, since it can help anyone do the same, it is also perfect if you want to build a more stable and more lasting relationship with someone, be that person a coworker, a friend or even a partner.
About Thomas Erikson
 is a Swedish lecturer and author.
He has written three books so far. He made his name with 
in 2014, which has been translated into 40 languages so far and is one of Sweden’s best-selling non-fiction books of the past half-decade.
Erikson’s other two books can be described as sequels to his debut: 
 is a book about manipulation, and the recently published 
a book about, well, bad bosses.

“Surrounded by Idiots PDF Summary”
The word “idiot” is defined by the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as “a foolish or stupid person.” 
As far as Thomas Erikson is concerned, however, an “idiot” is merely someone who has a different behavior 
—and, consequently, style of communication—than the one dubbing him one.
Of course, this is not something Erikson believed when he was young when he too “pigeonholed people into two groups—good and sensible people and all the rest, the people who didn’t seem to understand anything at all:”
And how did Erikson’s worldview change? 
Well, when he was 25, he was supposed to interview a 60-year-old CEO by the name of Sture who told him that “he was surrounded by idiots.” The more Thomas thought about this sentence, the less he was able to understand it.
“But who hired all these idiots?” he eventually asked Sture, fully aware that it could have been only him and nobody else.
Of course, at this point, Sture wanted to fetch a shotgun and shoot Thomas (his words), but Thomas wanted to make a pretty important point. 
Namely, even Sture didn’t 
 believe that he was surrounded by idiots: he was just incapable of 
with them properly. And we’ve already shared the reason with you: Sture didn’t know that people have different behavior profiles and that you can’t communicate with everyone in the same manner.
And this is what Erikson’s 
is all about: “the world’s most widely used method to describe the differences in human communication.”
The method is called the DISA or DISC system, acronyms that stand for Dominance, Inducement, Submission, and Analytic/Compliance ability. These four terms are the primary behavior types that describe how people see themselves in relationship to their environment. And each of these behavior types is associated with a color: Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue.
But before we get to the system itself and its applications, it would be a good idea to take a brief history tour.
People Have Always Been Like This
Even though the categorization of people in accordance with some theoretical behavior profile may seem like a modern invention, the truth is that in all cultures, there has always been a need to categorize people. 
And interestingly enough, many of these categorizations can be considered precursors to the DISA system. Erikson compares it to the two most familiar.
Four centuries before Christ, Hippocrates, the father of medicine, devised a theory that every person’s temperament is the product of the (dis)balance between the four humors—i.e., the four bodily fluids—that flow inside him: blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm.
The system, further developed by the Roman physician Galen, is now called the humoral system, and it suggests that there are four fundamental personality types:
As you’ll see in a moment, these four personality types correspond to the ones theorized by the DISA system: sanguine people are yellow, choleric are red, melancholic are blue, and phlegmatic are black.
Many centuries after Hippocrates, on the other side of the Atlantic, the Aztecs developed a similar proto-psychological theory based on something they knew quite well: the four elements:
Once again, this system corresponds to the DISA behavior types: fire people are red, air people are yellow, earth people are green, and water people are blue.
You probably don’t know this, but the guy who laid the foundations for the DISA/DISC model was also the guy who invented the lie detector and—get this—created the character of Wonder Woman! 
At least at the present moment, we can think of nobody as ludicrously versatile as Walter Moulton Marston.
Anyway, Marston noticed that the distinct differences between people can be conveniently described via four different relationships between an individual and his environment, which he explained in this manner:
•  
ominance produces activity in an antagonistic environment. 
•  
nspiration produces activity in a favorable environment. 
•  
ubmission produces passivity in a favorable environment. 
•  
ompliance produces passivity in an antagonistic environment.
Erikson—and most people nowadays—use Stability instead of Submission and Analytic ability instead of Compliance (because these two relationships between an individual and other people/his environment seem to better explain people’s behavior types) and further describe these traits thus:
• 
ominance relates to how a person approaches problems and deals with challenges. It is all about 
.
• 
nspiration is about being able to influence and convince others to do something. Inspiration is about 
.
• 
tability is about an individual’s receptiveness to change, in that a strong need for stability means a person is resistant to change (the “good old days” guy) and a lower need for stability means a more adventurous person. Stability is all about 
.
• 
nalytic ability is about following rules and regulations. Analytical people can’t accept that things may go wrong or happen at random. Analytic ability is all about 
.
Before we go one, here’s one of the many wonderful graphs in 
: it sums up the above much better and it will make even more sense in the next section of our summary.
An Overview of the System
Now, the system Erikson uses in 
is the DISA system. The only difference is that he uses colors instead of the four traits described above—mainly because he has found out, via experience, that people remember the system better this way.
In Erikson’s system:
• Dominant people are Red people
• Inspiring people are Yellow people
• Stable people are Green people
• Analytical people are blue people
Or, to use a graph which mirrors the one above and makes all things very clear:
In the real world, only 5% of people have only one color that dominates their behavior, and over 80% have a combination of two colors along whose spectrum their behaviors can be described. The rest—15%—are dominated by three colors.
Throughout the book, Erikson focuses on the single colors individually “because they are the fundamental components of a person’s behavior.” “It’s like a recipe,” he writes, “we need to understand all the ingredients before we bake the cake.” 
Before we move to the colors, some interesting things to have in mind (and come back to once you finish the other section):
• The most common behavior among people is Green in combination with another color (or even entirely Green behavior). The least common is entirely Red behavior or Red behavior in combination with one other color.
• Blues and Reds, as well as Greens and Yellows, are complementary types: grouping people like that makes invincible teams (as well as long-lasting friendships and marriages)
• Because in the real world, most people are dominated by two colors, here is the best combination in the spectrum: Blue/Green and Red/Yellow.
• In most cases, Reds and Greens fail to work as a team, and, due to mutual disliking, are better off grouped otherwise.
• Finally, Yellow and Blue is the worst combination among all: you don’t want them in the same room, whether as workers, friends or lovers.
Now—onto the colors!

Key Lessons from “Surrounded by Idiots”
1.      Why Are We the Way We Are?
2.      Ever Since Ancient Times, People Categorized People 
3.      There Are Four Behavior Types—and You Are Probably a Combination of Two of Them
Why Are We the Way We Are?
It is difficult to answer this question, but, as we’ve told you before, it’s mostly a combination of heredity and environment (or, to be more precise, 
.)
Erikson goes a few steps further and talks about core values, attitudes, core behavior, moderated behavior, and environment, still making clear that at least one or two of these aspects of our personalities are beyond our choice.
He even shares with his readers a neat equation:
BEHAVIOR = f (P × Sf)
In other words, 
is a function of 
 and 
, where our 
 is that which we can observe, 
 is what we try to figure out, and 
 are things that we have an influence on.
Ever Since Ancient Times, People Categorized People 
Even though psychology didn’t really exist before 
 and 
, people have categorized other people in accordance with some system ever since Ancient Greece.
It was then that Hippocrates developed his humoral pathology, according to which there are four personality types: sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic, and melancholic. The Aztecs developed quite a similar system as well, categorizing people in accordance with their relationship with the four elements: firey, airy, watery and earthy.
In the 20
 century, however, a guy by the name of Walter Moulton Marston developed a modern version of these categorizations called the DISA system, an acronym for the four most important traits according to the author: dominance, inspiration, stability (or submission, originally) and analytic ability (or compliance, originally)
There Are Four Behavior Types—and You Are Probably a Combination of Two of Them
Thomas Erikson—and many modern HR theoreticians—developed Marston’s system further and have now, for mnemonic reasons, color-coded it.
According to Erikson’s explanations in 
, people are either dominantly Red (dominant, direct, active), Yellow (inspiring, impulsive, influential), Green (stable, calm, supportive) or Blue (analytical, slow, cautious).
Only 5%, however, are exclusively dominated by one color, and just 15% can be described in a three-color range. The rest—80%—are dominated by two colors.
See our explanations above and find out which are 
two colors.

Our Critical Review
“A useful guide to communicating with the uncommunicable,” 
is (according to

True, some of the book’s generalizations seem unconvincing and even far-fetched, but, in our opinion, the best aspect of the book
is precisely its simplicity and directness, both in terms of the main idea and in terms of the author’s style. And we do believe (with

“A Monk’s Guide to Happiness PDF Summary”
If there is one thing Gelong Thubten, a Buddhist monk from the UK, can’t understand, it is the extent to which the concept of happiness is misunderstood and misinterpreted by the majority of people. 
“I’ve found that many people seek a kind of happiness which is a fleeting sensation: a ‘high’—an injection-like bolt of energy,” he writes. “Yet this never seems to last, and when they no longer experience that high, they crave it again.”
Unfortunately, Thubten is right.
Most of us don’t think of happiness as a 
we can learn, but as a 
we should obtain. We don’t think of happiness as something asking for our expertise and personal commitment (i.e., something similar to, say, math or sculpting), but as something which is the direct result of external circumstances, something that can only come from the outside.
Yet, this is evidently not true. 
“If it’s the case that two or more people don’t always find that the same things make them happy or unhappy,” reminds us Thubten, “then it means we’re talking about a mental experience within us, not the things around us.”
is a book about turning within, a manual on how one can find the source of happiness inside himself. 
It is a book based on the premise that we can
to be happy, 
.
And it is yet another book we’ll gladly summarize for you!
What Is Happiness?
 (and almost all philosophers after him), happiness is the only thing we desire for its own sake. It is the end-goal of all our endeavors. Whether you want more money or more love in your life, the real reason why you want these things is that you believe they will bring you happiness.
Consequently, it is not at all surprising that all of us are constantly searching for happiness. But what if we’re looking for it at all the wrong places?
Gelong Thubten thinks this the case for a very simple reason: most of us don’t even know what happiness is. That is why we confuse it with being a “hit,” a “buzz,” a sudden bolt of energy. 
In Thubten’s opinion (and, more importantly, experience), happiness is much less temporary and much less linked to external circumstances. It is something we have inside, and something into whose power we can easily tap in if we understood its nature.
So, perhaps, that is a great place to start—with a clear and profoundly thought-out answer to the question: “what is happiness?”
Thubten defines it along the lines of a few “crucial terms”—presence, completeness, and freedom:
What Makes Us Unhappy?
An even better way to understand happiness is to define it against its opposite: being unhappy. And Thubten has a very original and interesting take on what unhappiness is. 
It is, according to him, nothing less than the state of 
 for happiness.
Because when we are 
 for happiness, “there is a sense of hunger, of incompleteness; we are wrapped up in the expectation of getting what we want and the fear of not getting it; we feel trapped by uncertainty.”
And this state of uncertainty is overwhelming: it causes stress and discontent since we feel that our life at the present moment is not enough and that we can only be happy when our goals are completed.
But does that ever happen?
Say that you want to buy a pair of expensive glasses and say that you can’t afford them. Every time you think about them, you feel unhappy—you’re absolutely sure that once you buy those glasses, you’ll finally be happy.
Now, say that, eventually, you manage to find enough money to buy those glasses. How long before you start craving for something else? A week, a month, a few months? Perhaps even a few days. And then you’re back at the beginning.
And there’s no way you can trick this loop because of something scientists call 
. Also, because of something Gelong Thubten warns about at the beginning of his book: you’re thinking of happiness along the wrong lines.
The state of happiness isn’t something ephemeral—isn’t a hit of dopamine in the brain. The state of happiness, he says, is an enduring state of completeness, a state of peace, a state of no more striving and no more fear. 
The good thing is that these are all mental states, and that, consequently, all of them depend on you and you exclusively. No outside “things,” no circumstances you can’t control. 
Is it that easy?
We Are Hard-Wired to Be Happy
Yes, it is, says Thubten!
According to Buddhist philosophy, he reminds us, we are practically programmed to be happy: “The very reason we 
 be happy is that it is our true nature. This is why we feel things are in their rightful state when we’re happy: suffering feels like an intrusion into how things should be.”
And it’s not only the Buddhist who think this: science recently confirmed it as a fact.
“We are hard-wired for bliss,” famously exclaimed late neuroscientist Candace Pert sometime after discovering the opioid receptors, a group of protein-coupled receptors distributed widely in our brains, digestive tract, and spinal cord.
Their job (in case their name isn’t a giveaway) is to work as a sort of “cellular binding site for endorphins,” which, in turn, are hormones produced by the pituitary gland and the central nervous system whose principal task is to “inhibit the communication of pain signals.”
Yup, you read that right!
We may not be as blessed as the naked mole rats (which are practically immune to pain), but our body is designed in such a manner that it can’t help but producing its own morphine-like substances whenever it deems necessary to shelter us from pain.
But the very existence of this mechanism which protects us from negative influences is evidence enough that our body is programmed to know what is right and what is wrong in the first place. Interestingly enough, therein lies the problem.
Ash Ranpura, neuroscientist and frequent collaborator of Gelong Thubten, describes the problem thus: “when things are going well, the brain simply ticks over its default state, but if we are about to trip and fall, for example, it generates ‘error signal’ which kicks into gear.”
In other words, when everything’s fine, you feel 
. When something is wrong—you feel bad. And you can’t help it: your brain will always adjust to the perfect state of things and notice only the bad things.
“Simply put,” writes Thubten, “when we are walking in a park on a glorious sunny day, and we have a toothache, we take the sunshine and beauty for granted, but tend to focus on the painful tooth. We are primed to notice what’s wrong, as it feels like an intrusion into our natural state.”
Meditation is the Key to Happiness
If there is one thing people deem inescapable, it is certainly our biology. 
So, if we are biologically built to predominantly notice the things which blemish our perfect state (be their things or wants, regrets or misfortunes), how are we supposed to achieve those mental states (presence, completeness, freedom) which happiness consists of?
Well, we’re not going to tell you anything new: meditation is the key to achieving happiness.
Most people think of it as something which temporarily reduces stress. This couldn’t be further from the truth: meditation, combined with mindfulness, is a way of living your life, a way of hacking your genetic predetermination to notice the bad things, a way of connecting with your essence.
In fact, one of the Tibetan words for meditation is 
, which literally means “to become familiar with.” 
And what are we becoming familiar with through meditation? 
Well, it’s nothing new: it’s merely our already existing awareness that there is a part of our brain which is constantly free.
You may think this is something you’re not aware of, but, trust us—you are. Whether you want it or not, you can constantly observe your thoughts and emotions. You are not only 
 anger or sadness, but you also 
 that you are angry or sad.
It is this latter part of the brain that meditation targets and attempts to develop: the observing part:
Much of Gelong Tubten’s book includes practical suggestions on how you can implement meditation and mindfulness in your life. Since this is something we’ve already covered in so many other summaries, we decided to focus on the theory behind this.
And we feel that the above pretty much wraps up all the theory you need. Now, it’s time you start practicing meditation and, well, being happy.
Key Lessons from “A Monk’s Guide to Happiness”
1.      Feeling Good in the “Instant Happiness” Culture
2.      Happiness Is Much More Than a Hit: It Is Freedom
3.      You Are Hard-Wired to Be Happy: Use This to Be Happy As Often As Possible
Feeling Good in the “Instant Happiness” Culture
Everybody wants to feel good, so it’s no surprise that, nowadays, everyone attempts to sell this feeling.
Whether it is through a new drink, a new shirt, or a new car—what all those ads you see while scrolling through Facebook or browsing through your favorite magazines are selling to you is nothing more but some mythical feeling of happiness.
Or so they say.
What they are actually selling to you is a lie—a lie that you are not good enough, that you, in your current state, 
something. And, even scarier, that happiness is something which comes from the “outside.”
Happiness Is Much More Than a Hit: It Is Freedom
As Buddhists have known for a couple of millennia, happiness is not just a dopamine rush in your brain: it is an enduring state of completeness and peace of mind.
Much more, it is freedom—freedom from the fear of missing out, freedom from the burden of the past and the future, freedom from your wants and desires.
You Are Hard-Wired to Be Happy: Use This to Be Happy As Often As Possible
No matter how good you feel, you’ll never be happy if you think of happiness in terms of external things and circumstances. 
The reason is called hedonic adaptation, which, in layman’s terms, means that your brain takes the good things that happen to you for granted, and the bad states as aberrations. In other words, it only 
 when something is bad.
However, 
, you need to check all of the items on your list (partner, family, children, friends, career…) to be fully happy and content; even if one remains unchecked (say, you have toothache), you’ll feel unhappy.
It would be a certain recipe for disaster this genetic precondition of ours if you didn’t have the chance to learn to use it to your benefit. 
And you can quite easily: just be mindful of it and meditate, and everything will work out fine in the end.

“Tell Me More PDF Summary”
Trying to name the phrases that make love and connection possible, as the blurb of 
states, seems like a crazy idea.
After all, on the face of it, love and connection are two just too complex phenomena to be framed into language. It is for the reason that, instinctively, we often think of love as something of a shortcut to telepathy. Two people in love (be they spouses, best friends, or a mother and a child) are capable of understanding each other without the use of words, almost exclusively through glances, smiles, kisses, and touches.
“The other problem with language,” adds Kelly Corrigan, “is that arranging words into sentences requires we flip on our thinking machine, which necessarily claims some of our focus, so that as soon as we start deciding how to explain a feeling, we’re not entirely feeling the feeling anymore, and some feelings want to be felt at full capacity.”
Such are the feelings Corrigan conveys through the 12 stories in her book, each of which simultaneously mocks “the reach of language” and, yet, is conveniently captured in the title in the net of just a few simple words: 
“It’s like this.” “Tell me more.” “I don’t know.” “I know.” “No.” “Yes.” “I was wrong.” “Good enough.” “I love you.” “No words at all.” “Onward.” “This is it.”
For our summary today, we share a few of Corrigan’s stories.
It’s Like This
Three months after her beloved dad Greenie had passed away, the life of Kelly Corrigan fell apart.
“There was no real reason for it to fall apart that morning,” she writes. “And, in fact, 
didn’t. I did.”
On the face of it, it was just another regular morning at the Corrigans. However, by the time Kelly had opened her eyes waking from a pleasant dream to the smell of bacon (her husband’s everyday breakfast), the whole world seemed to her as if already out of joint.
It’s not that something especially alarming had happened—it was, more or less, the usual routine. Only this time, it hit Kelly hard—and she was overwhelmed.
Kelly heard her teenage daughters—Georgia (16), a “world-class procrastinator”, and Claire (14), a Lin-Manuel Miranda fan—fighting over who’s wearing whose shirt once again, and, before too long, saw Edward, her husband (a Ben Stiller lookalike and a diehard Warriors fan) leaving for work.
That was always his way of dealing with things. “Let ‘em fight!” he had learned from 
 he had ever read, and so he always did just that. Kelly couldn’t stand that—just as she couldn’t stand the mess that she was in the morning or the mess in the kitchen.
She was about to shout and rage and break every single thing around her into a thousand tiny smithereens when she remembered the favorite phrase of her meditation teacher: “it’s like this.”
Sometimes, life is just like this. Unbearable, untidy, chaotic. As a consequence, we become irritable and ready to be angry at just about anyone. However, that changes nothing. The only thing we can do is accept life in all its messiness, taking a deep breath and saying: “it’s like this.”
Tell Me More
“Why are you trying to fix things! I just need you to listen!” 
Probably every man on this planet has heard these words quite a few times in his life. The problem is they do not really understand them: they rarely listen, and, instead, always offer solutions. 
However, even when these solutions make a lot of sense (such as in 
), they usually end up only making matters worse. Why shouldn’t they? You’re calling a cab for someone who actually just wants to ride with you: the destination is irrelevant.
Kelly’s friend Tracy seems to have understood this better than anyone. Possibly because as difficult as it is in relationships, it is even more difficult to 
 listen when it comes to your children. “It is a bit like watching someone struggle over a puzzle,” Tracy said once to Kelly, “and you have the final piece in your pocket.”
Watching your child suffer over something you can solve is possibly one of the most challenging things a parent will ever be asked to do. And, yet, in a way, it is one of the things you should do most often.
Kelly learned this in practice.
Once, Tracy was with her when her daughter Georgia (then eleven) called her to complain over the fact that nobody likes her at school. Apparently, she was accused by another girl (Piper) that she had been mean to her (even though she wasn’t), but nobody believed her.
Kelly was torn between two things: either ask Georgia what she had done (because she must have done 
, mustn’t she?) or go straight to her school. Instead, advised by Tracy, she just said: “Tell me more.”
And Georgia did tell her everything. By the end of the discussion, she wasn’t crying anymore.
No
We’ve talked about 
 As far as Kelly Corrigan is concerned, it seems that we should be talking about it even more.
“Sexually, professionally, personally,” she writes, “saying ‘No’ takes balls. One friend told me her one big take away from three years, and $11,000 of therapy was ‘Learn to say no and when you do, don’t complain and don’t explain. Every excuse you make is like an invitation to ask you again in a different way.’”
Kelly’s mother knew how to say no. “She had her own mind, and she used it,” Corrigan writes. In other words, she never bothered about what other people might think of her if she declines their invitation to do something or go somewhere. She’d just wave them off with a simple no-excuses no and, instead, spend the evening alone, calm and happy:
“It must be possible to say ‘No’ nicely and still be loved,” Kelly writes, remembering her mother. After all, no matter how many times her mother had said “no,” she was always adored by her (and by all of her family).
Children are exceptional at saying “no;” adults are very bad at this. Kelly was great when she was a child: after her mother had ordered the wrong thing for her birthday, Kelly refused to eat cheese for the next ten years—even though it was her favorite food. 
We guess Kelly isn’t as good at saying “no” anymore, because the story she relates to us to describe the power of “no” and its value as an interhuman connector is one in which the “no” comes from her husband.
You see, Kelly had a plan for her life: she wanted to give birth to four children by the time of her 40
 birthday, and with 2 already under the belt at 36, she was way on course to make her dream a reality.
But then she had to battle with cancer, and the chemotherapy suspended her fertility. She had no option but to move to Plan B, so she asked her husband if he wanted to adopt two children.
You already know what Edward said: “No.”
He was at a good place in his life at the time—happily married with two children—and it was time for him to dedicate more time to himself and his career.
Kelly was, at first, devastated, but she soon realized that, as difficult as this “no” was, it was the only way out of an unpredictable and messy future. If Edward hadn’t been a bit selfish, he might have regretted it later on, and maybe their marriage would have come under threat.
To sum up, no matter what they say to you, and no matter how difficult it is to utter it, “no” is a word of love. Use it wisely.
Good Enough
Do you know why Jewish children are religiously initiated at the age of 13?
Well, Kelly didn’t, and soon after the bat mitzvah of Ruby—daughter of her friend Ariel—finished, she asked the Rabbi named Michael for the reason.
Michael told her that the age of thirteen is pivotal in a human’s life. It is not merely a moment of incredible intellectual growth, but also the point of no return into adulthood.
Though simple, the goal of these imitations is as significant as anything: to tell the children of yesterday that the world of tomorrow is theirs for the taking. To pat them on the back and make sure that they are able to understand their power to be something more than just mere passers-by and to become the change they want to see in the world.
There’s nothing more important than this belief, says Kelly Corrigan. For children of 13, most adults are almost mythical figures, bigger-than-life heroes who can do just about anything.
That’s why it is important that these people show the thirteen-year-olds of the world that they are not that much different.
“That’s how it works,” writes Corrigan. “Someone important believes in us, loudly and with conviction and against all substantiation, and over time, we begin to believe, too—not in our shot at perfection, mind you, but in the good enough version of us that they have reflected.”
Key Lessons from “Tell Me More”

3.      The Most Beautiful Three Words in the English Language
Putting Your Feelings Into Words
Sometimes, it is difficult to put feelings into words. Kelly Corrigan argues that, when it matters the most, it is downright impossible to do that.
Why?
Because to express something, you need to use language, and language is something your brain does. Consequently, you can’t say how you feel without first stopping yourself from feeling that thing for a moment to put it into words.
Maybe there is a way to circumvent this. 
Just use the usual phrases, the clichés if you will, empowered by the feelings and uttered as if for the first time: “It’s like this.” “Tell me more.” “I don’t know.” “I know.” “No.” “Yes.” “I was wrong.” “Good enough.” “I love you.” “No words at all.” “Onward.” “This is it.”
Learn to Live with the Complexity of Things
Being honest with yourself starts with three simple words: “I don’t know.” Socrates turned this into a method for extracting knowledge; you ought to turn in a way of life.
Take Kelly for example.
Raised in a devoutly Catholic Irish-American family, she still doesn’t know what to make of God. Throughout her life, she has “stood in every square on the board: obedient believer, secretly hopeful, open-but-dubious… walked away from the board entirely, only to circle back.”
Nowadays, all she can say is this: “I’m not sure of anything.” But that’s quite enough—life is a mystery, and we should live it that way more often than not.
“I try to be one of the exceptional people who can live with the complexity of things,” Kelly writes, “who are at peace with the unknown and the unknowable, who leave all the cages open. I tell myself: There’s so much that you don’t know, you can’t know, you aren’t ever going to know.”
The Most Beautiful Three Words in the English Language
As powerful as they are, “I don’t know” are nobody’s favorite words in the English language; nor are “it’s like this,” “tell me more,” “I was wrong,” or “This is it”—three phrases Kelly analyzes through her stories.
The most beautiful three words in the English language can’t be any other but “I love you,” can they? 
Kelly sums up their power beautifully in three sentences we just had to quote:
“The first time the words pass between two people: electrifying. Ten thousand times later: cause for marvel. The last time: the dream you revisit over and over and over again.”

Who Should Read “Three Women”? And Why?
It’s the 21
 century, there are nearly naked photos of just about everyone you know on Instagram, and pornography is ubiquitous, so it is more than exaggerated to say that sex is still a taboo topic. 
Yet, as 
demonstrates, it is nothing less than that for about half of the United States. Moreover, the taboo of heterosexual marriage being a sham 9 out of 10 times is a taboo topic for just about everybody, it seems.
Compared to Kristen Roupenian’s viral phenomenon “
,” 
is a book for all the women out there who feel that their desire is crippled and maimed by society. It is also a book for all the men who want to understand their wives, their girlfriends, their mothers, their sisters—and do something to make them happier.

Her short story “
” won the Andrew Lytle Prize for the best story published in 2018 by

Currently working on her first novel, 
is Taddeo’s debut nonfiction work.
 “Three Women PDF Summary”
“It’s the nuances of desire that hold the truth of who we are at our rawest moments,” writes Lisa Taddeo in the “Prologue” to 
.
That’s why—additionally stirred by the fact that her mother, for reasons unknown to Lisa, allowed for years an old man she didn’t know to masturbate to her going to work—Taddeo set out “to register the heat and sting of female want so that men and other women might more easily comprehend before they condemn.”
“Because,” she says, “it’s the quotidian minutes of our lives that will go on forever, that will tell us who we were, who our neighbors and our mothers were, when we were too diligent in thinking they were nothing like us.”
As suggested by the title—perhaps borrowed from Robert Musil’s collection of three novellas—Taddeo’s debut work is the story of three women, whose sexual lives and desires the author followed and painstakingly recorded for almost a decade.
Their names are Maggie (real name), Lina, and Sloane (pseudonyms).
Maggie
When we first meet Maggie, she is a 23-year-old girl from Fargo, North Dakota, going to court to confront the town’s favorite teacher, Aaron Knodel.
By her account, six years before that—when she was just a teenager in the second semester of her freshman year—Aaron Knodel had seduced and used her in the way a “wholesomely carnal” teacher “possessing the strut of a movie star” can seduce and use a 17-year-old dream-eyed child completely and utterly enthralled with him.
Interestingly, during their years-long affair, the two never had sex: Aaron never allowed that. They did everything else, though—even with Aaron’s children in the same house, sleeping—until, one day, Aaron’s wife discovered the texts between the two and Aaron abruptly ended everything with Maggie.
Maggie was devastated. 
With Aaron, it was the first time in her life that she felt something as profound and as beautiful as love. “Like many girls her age,” writes Taddeo, with him “Maggie [was] laid out before the world, unafraid, unpopulated. Men come to insert themselves, they turn a girl into a city. When they leave, their residue remains, the discoloration on the wood where the sun came through every day for many days, until one day it didn’t.”
Maggie said nothing for some time, until one day, she learned that Aaron Knodel was named North Dakota’s Teacher of the Year.
It was then that she decided to step forward.
In this #MeToo era, you would expect the exact opposite to happen, i.e., everybody to believe her and deem Aaron the perpetrator without any evidence.
But this isn’t Los Angeles or New York so what follows is something even worse, located on the other side of the spectrum> nobody believes Maggie. In fact, everybody starts talking about her as a “crazy and broken” girl who wants nothing more than a payback and some money.
The fact that her relationship with Aaron started after she confided to him that she has had a relationship with another older man is used as evidence against her in court. Aaron’s status—popular and well-liked married man and teacher with children—is enough to question almost everything Maggie says.
The final verdict?
Aaron is innocent, and he keeps his job.
Maggie, on the other hand, is scarred for life. Because of her relationship with Aaron, she has dropped out of college and now works as a waitress, hardly the career she hoped for and dreamt of.
“There are two Americas,” concludes Taddeo, absolutely certain that Aaron is guilty and Maggie twice the victim. “There are men, and there are women, and one still rules the other in certain pockets of the country, in moments that are not televised. Even when women fight back, they must do it correctly. They must cry the right amount and look pretty but not hot.”
Lina
We move to suburban Indiana to meet Lina, the second of the three women from the title, a homemaker and a mother of two. 
The thing she wanted the most in her life was to be desired by someone. 
Unfortunately for her, she ended up being married to Ed, someone who, after ten years of marriage, doesn’t like to kiss her anymore, because the sensation of someone else’s tongue in his mouth “offends” him.
Lina loves her children, but almost nothing else about her life:
One day, Lina reconnects online with an old crush of hers: Aidan. Aidan was one of the popular guys at her school, “strong and hot and extremely quiet so that every time he opens his mouth it’s exciting.” 
However, she lost him after one kiss and after she was basically sexually assaulted by three guys during a party that was not really a party (that’s not how the story was told by the guys, though).
Now, years later, Lina has no intention of letting him go. Though married with children of his own, Aidan, still “a loaf of a man,” reciprocates. The passion is real and knee-tingling and heart-drubbing. The passion overcomes Lina. 
The guy she shared her first kiss with is the guy who has now awoken her from her monotonous “sleeping maid marriage” with another. And another. And another.
Entirely physical, the affair goes on and on—mostly on the backs of their cars and in hotel rooms. Even though Lina is very much aware that Aidan isn’t as attached to this as she is, she doesn’t mind: just like 
, Lina finds in this affair something more, something akin to sexual liberation.
And she knows how much that has changed her.
“Not having a partner, for Lina, was like slowly, quietly dying,” writes Taddeo. “Maybe Aidan… would never leave his wife. Maybe none of the ways in which she’d gilded him were accurate. But Aidan made her veins hot. He made her feel like a girl and not a part of the house. She could no longer see the end of her life clearly, she could no longer picture the grayness of the earth she would be buried under and the road the hearse would take to get her there. And that was more living than she’d done in her whole life.”
Sloane
Sloane is the pseudonym Taddeo uses instead of the name of a wealthy restaurateur in her early forties, thin and genuine with a face like a sorority girl and a very long, very beautiful hair the color of chestnuts.
She is married to a man named Richard, “who is not as handsome as she is beautiful.” The two have two daughters, “equine and vibrant like their mother; and a third child, Lila, Richard’s daughter from his first relationship.”
They live in Newport, on Rhode Island’s Narragansett Bay, own a restaurant, and, as a family, are both “bound very neatly” and distant enough so that each member can be his or her own person.
It is this last thing that really changes everything one day, when, out of the blue, Karin, an employee at their restaurant, proposes Richard something indecent: a threesome. “You can propose that to Sloane, if you like,” Richard, always the devoted husband, calmly replied.
A few days later, Karin and Sloane spend a day together with each other, and they spend the night together with Richard. One thing leads to another and, before too long, the three engage in a sexual relationship. At first, Sloane has problems watching her husband inside another woman. 
She overcomes them the same night, but for Richard they become a character trait: soon after, he starts encouraging (even pressuring) his wife into relationships with other men. Sometimes, she describes him these affairs. More often, however, he watches them firsthand.
Problems arise when Jenny, the wife of one of Sloane’s favorite extramarital partners, Wes, finds out about her husband’s sexual affair.
“You’re the woman,” she confronts Sloane. “And you let this happen… Don’t you know you’re supposed to have the power?”
“What she really wanted was for Richard to explain to Jenny that he’d pushed her to do it, which was the truth,” informs us Taddeo. “She wanted him to say, Look, this isn’t Sloane going after Wes; we were confused about your relationship. This is something we both did as a couple. It wasn’t Sloane. She’s not what you think.”
Richard didn’t do that. 
But that didn’t take away too much of Sloane’s love for him.
Strangely enough, as far as Sloane is concerned, “there is nothing more important than the fact that she wants her husband above all others, and he wants her above all else.”
Key Lessons from “Three Women”
1.      The Hypocrisies of the Heterosexual Marriage
2.      Scarred by the Male Gaze
3.      The Persistence of Gender Inequality
The Hypocrisies of the Heterosexual Marriage
“Monogamy today,” wrote 
 in “The Overdue Demise of Monogamy,” “compares with heterosexuality not too many decades ago, or tolerance of slavery 150 years ago. Quite a lot of people depart from it, a much smaller minority actively advocate the acceptance of departure from it, but most people advocate it and disparage the minority view.”
justifies this observation. Among the three women it portrays, the one who has something that is the closest to a happy marriage is Sloane, a middle-aged swinger who has threesomes with people chosen by her husband. 
Paradoxically, it is this subversion of marriage roles that seems to work better than traditional marriage or the notion of everlasting love for the women investigated by Taddeo. Is it at all surprising that this is true for many other couples as well?
Scarred by the Male Gaze
“One inheritance of living under the male gaze for centuries,” writes Lisa Taddeo at one place, “is that heterosexual women often look at other women the way a man would.”
That’s why Maggie, a sufferer of the after-effects of an affectionate relationship with a married teacher of hers, is publicly shamed and insulted by other women as well when she decides to raise the issue and confront her teacher in court.
In the wake of #MeToo, it may seem strange to write a paragraph such as the one above, but, 
, the above is nothing more but an aspect of human nature.
“The way the wind blows in our country can make us question who we are in our own lives,” notes Taddeo along these lines. “Often, the type of waiting women do is to make sure other women approve so that they may also approve of themselves.”
The Persistence of Gender Inequality
Men and women are equal, but only if you are living in the developed parts of the developed world. 
For half of the American women, the first five words of the sentence above have no meaning at all: as Maggie found out, even being the victim changes nothing because when the man who used you is religious, married and respected, the whole community will stand beside him.
That’s how it has been for millennia. That’s how it still is for millions of women in the US.

“Three Women Quotes”
Our Critical Review
Written in the tradition of Katherine Boo’s 
, 
has been justly described as “a work of deep observation, long conversations, and a kind of journalistic alchemy” (
), and “a groundbreaking portrait of erotic longing in today’s America.”
And it is the more interesting America of today one can get to know on these pages, the one—as Taddeo notes—that is “not televised” and is all the more real for that. It is the America of female desire in a still patriarchal structure of relationships, the America of taboos nobody speaks about but everyone breaks, the America of sex and tears and marital infidelity.
Lauded as “the most in-depth look at the female sex drive that’s been published in decades” by

is “breathtaking” and “staggeringly intimate” (

And it is definitely one of the books of 2019."

Having problems with women and work?
Possibly this is because you’re going the wrong way.
There is only one right way, says David Deida:
Who Should Read “The Way of the Superior Man”? And Why?
Even though much more moderate, 
is polarizing enough that some people deem it an accidental part of the Manosphere canon. In other words, it is a book that perhaps fans of Neil Strauss’ 
Robert Green’s 
—and even Robert Glover’s 
 or Rollo Tomassi’s 
should enjoy.
However, to use the words of the author from the “Introduction” to the 20
 anniversary edition, 
 is also a book “written explicitly for people who have already achieved respect for other genders and sexual preferences, and who consider men and women to be social, economic, and political equals.”
So, be warned: if you don’t believe the above, then it may be a bit dangerous to read 
because you might get the wrong idea about what men and women are, and instead of a better man, become a worse man after putting its suggestions into practice.

“The Way of the Superior Man PDF Summary”
“This book,” writes Deida at the beginning of 
,
is a guide for a specific kind of newly evolving man. This man is unabashedly masculine—he is purposeful, confident, and directed, living his chosen way of life with deep integrity and humor—and he is sensitive, spontaneous, and spiritually alive, with a heart-commitment to discovering and living his deepest truth.”
If you want to become this man—who is neither a King Kong nor a wimp, neither an old-style macho nor an androgynous Mr. Nice Guy—then read on. As Deida says:
Part One: A Man’s Way
As suggested by the very title, there is such a thing as a man’s way—and it is a way very different from the way of the woman.
In order to tread upon it you need to:
“As long as life continues, the creative challenge is to tussle, play, and make love with the present moment while giving your unique gift,” writes Deida. Things never end, so don’t act like they will. Embrace the fight and march ahead.
Boys don’t cry—according to the old macho ideal. According to the Way of the Superior Man, they do when they need to, because it is much better to live with a hurting, than a closed heart. Don’t act: stay and act from inside the wound of pain.
Both literally and metaphorically. A man must love his father, but he must never allow to live in his shadow. That’s why, in strictly Freudian manner, it is essential to kill your father. 
• 
Each man has a capacity for growth, i.e. a limit. Don’t forget this. Because “where a man’s edge is located is less important than whether he is actually living his edge in truth, rather than being lazy or deluded.”
• 
 and hold onto it. Do anything necessary to discover your purpose and then organize your life around it.
• 
Holding onto your why means not being a wimp: never betray your purpose for a woman.
• 
“Every man knows that his highest purpose in life cannot be reduced to any particular relationship,” writes Deida. “If a man prioritizes his relationship over his highest purpose, he weakens himself, disserves the universe, and cheats his woman of an authentic man who can offer her full, undivided presence.”
• 
Don’t stay in your comfort zone. Freedom is all about pushing your limits. Lean just beyond your edge and do this constantly. In everything you do.
•
“The way a man penetrates the world should be the same way he penetrates his woman,” says Deida in an oft-quoted sentence of this chapter, “not merely for personal gain or pleasure, but to magnify love, openness, and depth.”
• 
Women are hurt by criticism: this is, after all, their nature. Men, however, should never be. They should always be open to receiving direct criticism from other men and make use of it. This is the sign of the Superior Man.
• 
Back to your purpose. What are you doing without it, man? Men without a purpose are not only lost and drifting, they are also sexually impotent and incapable of putting things into motion.
• 
If your purpose doesn’t align with your form of living, you must be prepared to alter absolutely everything about yourself to make amends and start living the life you were destined to.
• 
“A man should, of course, be a full participant in caring for children and the household,” writes Deida in a controversial sentence, “but if he gives up his deepest purpose to do so, ultimately, everyone suffers.” 
• 
There is nothing more important than your purpose. Everything else is just a bunch of minutiae. Don’t let yourself get lost in these everyday tasks and duties. Focus on what’s important.
•
In a way, a woman is created to test her man—in the form of “complaining, challenging him, changing her mind, doubting him, distracting him, or even undermining his purpose in a subtle or not so subtle way.” Appreciate and embrace this. Because, as Deida writes:
Part Two: Dealing with Women
On the subject of women—in part two, Deida explains how a man should deal with them in the proper manner. And he shares seven insights and practical bits of advice:
The word “lying” is a masculine word, in the sense that only men are consistent and can lie or tell the truth. Women, being emotional, say how they feel at the present moment. “A man’s word is his honor,” says Deida. “A woman’s word is her true expression in the moment.”
• 
Men grow by challenge, while women by praise. So, praise your woman freely and unabashedly.
• 
In yet another somewhat paradoxical piece of advice, Deida claims that while a man should love a woman and serve her with every ounce of his being, he “shouldn’t tolerate bitchy and complaining moodiness.” Tolerating leads to resenting, and resenting to breaking up or divorcing.
• 
As we said above, women are not consistent. And because they change constantly, no analysis will ever pin them down. Accept your woman the same way you accept the weather: even the storms are part of a pattern that promises a sunny day just around the corner.
• 
A big no-no: the feminine is “pure energy in motion” and 
 or 
 are negation of this. And if the suggestion for something like that comes from you—that’s even worse!
•
Apparently, when a woman gets emotionally intense, the superior man is capable of penetrating her mood “with imperturbable love and unwavering consciousness.” Try doing that and stop being the mediocre man who wants to discuss things over. 
• 
One of the foundational masculine traits is taking responsibility. And making decisions comes with this. Forcing your woman to make decisions—or even allowing her this—may backfire, because, unlike men, women don’t feel comfortable taking responsibility.
Part Three: Working with Polarity and Energy
As the old wisdom says: opposites attract. Here’s Deida take on this:
About 80% of all men have a more masculine sexual essence, says Deida, and all of these men are attracted to all things feminine (radiant women, music, nature, beer, etc.) It is simply inevitable. Don’t hide this attraction: allow it flourish.
•
Love is a simple equation according to Deida: “If a man is very masculine by nature, then he will be attracted to a very feminine woman, who will complement his energy. The more neutral or balanced he is, the more balanced he will prefer his woman. And, if a man is more feminine by nature, his energy will be complemented by the strong direction and purposiveness of a more masculine woman.”
• 
As can be deduced from the quote above, the more masculine a man is, the better it is not only for him, but for his woman as well. Because the more masculine is, the more he will crave for his woman’s feminine energy, giving her a chance to develop in the right direction.
• 
There is no way to avoid this. However, there is a way to not act upon it. And you shouldn’t—because it eventually ends up complicating your life much more than anything else.
• 
Even old men like younger women, and young men rarely like older women. Why? Because “youth in a woman bespeaks radiant, unobstructed, and refreshing feminine energy.”
• 
Time for another generalization: there are “hot” and “cool” women. If you need a stereotype, dark-skinned, brunette, red-headed, Korean, and Polynesian women are hot, and blonde, light-skinned, Japanese, and Chinese women are cool. It is irritating to have a hot woman when you need someone to cool you, and vice versa. Understand the temperature of feminine energy and choose wisely.
Part Four: What Women Really Want
Just like Mel Gibson in the similarly-titled movie, Deida knows precisely what women want. And he shares his findings in the fourth part of 
.
• 
Evolutionary biologists mostly share this opinion: it’s the ladies who choose. Deida phrases this thus: “If a man wants a woman who doesn’t want him, he cannot win.” So, choose a woman who choose you to be her partner.
•
Men and women speak different languages, so don’t try to hard to understand your woman. Instead, think of her outbursts and illogical beliefs as tests, and pass them by magnifying love, consciousness, and success in your woman’s life, 
 of her requests.
• 
Don’t believe the literal content of a woman’s complaint. Just like babies’ cries, a woman’s complaints are warning bells and indications of a mood. Act accordingly, and never steer away from your purpose.
• 
“Although she would never admit it,” writes Deida, a woman “wants to feel that her man would be willing to sacrifice their relationship for the sake of his highest purpose.” So, don’t treat her as if she is more important than that, once again, 
of her requests.
• 
Even if you are perfect for ten years, thirty minutes of idiotism will cause your woman to forget your excellent track record. Men base their opinion of women on their past behavior, but for women this is irrelevant.
• 
Take charge: financially, sexually, emotionally, and spiritually. A woman can relax only if you take the wheel and steer the course independently from her.
Part Five: Your Dark Side
Don’t allow, for a second, to lose track of your dark side. A woman wants a man’s dark side. In fact, that is precisely what she wants in a man: the monster, the killer, in him. (Think 
, for example).
“The masculine is always seeking release from constraint into freedom,” writes Deida. “The feminine often doesn’t understand these masculine ways and needs.” Regardless of the latter: try to find your freedom.
It is dark the masculine force; if you disown it, you are kinking its hose and. thus, you weaken your masculine capacity to face the unknown while still being able to love your woman.
Fearlessness is “a quintessential form of the ultimate masculine gift.” A woman is turned off by men who are afraid: she wants someone capable of killing a mouse without blinking, someone ready to face everything that comes along the way, no matter how scary.
“The feminine destructress must be met by the masculine destroyer. The goddess of devotion must be met by the god of all-pervading love.” Equal the energy of your woman with appropriate consciousness: all other ways lead to destruction.
Part Six: Feminine Attractiveness
What makes the feminine in a woman attractive? Here’s what:
In women, there is never a shortage of feminine energy. There is, however, “resistance to receiving, trusting, and embracing it.” Open your heart and stop resisting: Life itself is the feminine.
Men shouldn’t compare older women to younger women: they should allow the former to be wise and powerful, intuitive and healing.
Don’t deny your sexual attraction to a woman, but don’t disperse it in mental fantasies as well. Let it circulate through your body and fill your heart.
A man must cultivate a polarized relationship to his woman and his world: this is the only way for him to remain in relationship with either. If you deny your desire for the feminine, you depolarize yourself, and that leads to impotence and purposelessness.
“A man’s attraction to women must be converted from attraction 
 women into attraction 
 women,” writes Deida. “He must feel through her beauty, into the very delight of which her beauty is but a ripple and reminder. His whole relation to appearance is epitomized in his relation to women, either as obsession, distraction, or revelation.”
Part Seven: Body Practices
You know you want to hear Deida’s opinion on sex. So let’s talk about the physical aspect of relationship a bit!
If you don’t have control over your ejaculation, then you cannot meet your woman’s needs. You must learn to convert the ejaculation “into non-ejaculatory whole body, brain, and heart orgasms.” Whatever that is.
“The principal bodily key to mastering the world and women is maintaining a full and open front of the body at all times,” suggest Deida. “The best method is through full and relaxed breathing, drawing energy down the front, and freeing attention from neurotic self-concern.”
Through the use of breath, feeling, and intention, you can contract the pelvic floor near the genitals and draw some energy up the spine. The result is a rejuvenating orgasm, which Deida poetically describes as an explosion of energy into the brain, from where it rains down through the body “like an ambrosial bliss.”
Part Eight: Men’s and Women’s Yoga of Intimacy
The final part of 
is dedicated on something Deida calls the “yoga of intimacy.” Here are his final instructions which should help you become a more evolved form of a man.
•
The only way for a relationship to work between a man and a woman is for them to respect each other’s priorities. The more masculine a man is, the more important his mission is to him; the more feminine a woman is, the more important an intimate relationship is to her. How one can solve this “primary asymmetry” through something more than just “taking it into account,” we don’t know. But one must—for a relationship to work.
• 
A woman is responsible for her man’s bodily energy (i.e., erections), and a man is responsible for the woman’s openness of mood and depth of love. In other words, the “direction of growth of a relationship is primarily the man’s responsibility”
• 
A macho man’s way of dealing with his woman is “My way or the high way.” Mr. Nice Guy’s way is the way of compromise or even self-negation: “OK, your way.” But a Superior Man’s way is the way of inspiring his woman to tread the path that most serves her growth in love and happiness.
• 
A woman strengthens her feminine radiance best “in the company of other women in mutual celebration and play.” A man, on the other hand, restores his purpose mainly in solitude, when faced with challenges, or in the company of other men like him. Arrange for all of these forms of restoration.
• 
“Like dissolving in the intensity of an orgasm, a man’s greatest desire is to be utterly released,” writes Deida in his final lesson, once again in a poetic manner. “Die in the giving of your gift, so you don’t even notice you have stopped holding onto yourself. Fear is your final excuse. Don’t fight it. Love through it.”
Key Lessons from “The Way of the Superior Man”
1.      Your Purpose Comes First, Your Women Come Second
2.      Embrace Both Your Masculinity and Your Woman’s Femininity
3.      Own Your Darkest Desires
Your Purpose Comes First, Your Women Come Second
“Your mission is your priority,” writes Deida in the first part of 
“Unless you know your mission and have aligned your life to it, your core will feel empty. Your presence in the world will be weakened, as will your presence with your intimate partner.”
So, the next time you notice yourself “giving in” to your woman and denying your true purpose to spend time with her, Deida advises that you should stop. 
“Tell your woman that you love her,” he says, “but you cannot deny your heart’s purpose. Tell her that you will spend thirty minutes (or some specific time) with her in absolute attention and total presence, but then you must return to carry on your mission.”
Supposedly, this should work. (Our note: it rarely will).
Embrace Both Your Masculinity and Your Woman’s Femininity
Deida believes that men are women are profoundly different and that the more attuned each of the sexes is to their ancestral and essentially unchangeable yin/yang energy, the more intense and stronger their sexual and spiritual union will be.
A man who is not embracing his masculine energy (i.e., who spends a lot of time combing his hair and/or buying clothes) opens a vacuum for this kind of energy that must be filled by the woman who, in turn, is thus stimulated to act more manly.
The bottom line: the more masculine a man is, the more space he allows his woman to embrace her femininity, and vice versa.
Own Your Darkest Desires
“The masculine is always seeking release from constraint into freedom,” says Deida, which is why a man must always be ready to own his darkest desires. Without doing this, he is purposefully limiting his freedom, which, as we said above is possibly the basic masculine trait.
If you are not free, you’ll never be able to find your life purpose, face your fears and lead a relationship. And without this, you’ll never be the man you 
 be and you’ll never give your woman the chance to see the best version of you.

“The Way of the Superior Man Quotes”
Our Critical Review
In essence, 
claims that a man should be more masculine and a woman more feminine if their goal is a spiritually and sexually stimulating union. 
And even though, in its latest edition, Deida tries to be a bit more politically correct, he generalizes just too many things related to sex and gender to achieve something more than a repackaged and diluted version of some of manosphere’s main tenets.As poetic as it is unscientific, we can see how 
can be enjoyed by many people and helpful to at least half of them (the men), but, for lack of a better phrase, it is simply not our cup of tea.

Who Should Read “The Art of Mental Training”? And Why?
Dedicated “to the Warrior/Champion within you,” 
is
for everyone who wants to become a little more than he is. 
It is a book that reveals the fundamentals of sports mental training—colloquially referred to as “the science of success”—an often-overlooked aspect of great accomplishments. 
Even though athletes should be able to take away much more from the book than people from other walks of life, don’t ignore 
even if you are an artist, a lawyer, or a doctor: everybody needs a little mental training to be better.
About DC Gonzalez
 is a peak performance coach and a bestselling author.
A former Federal Agent, he has also worked as a military cyber-security specialist and an aviator in the Navy.
A student of renowned NLP Master Practitioner, P.C. Siegel, Gonzales has trained numerous top athletes, pro-fighters, soldiers, executives, actors, doctors, musicians, lawyers, psychologists to achieve new levels of performance and greatness.
is his only book so far.
“The Art of Mental Training PDF Summary”
“Whatever is going on inside your head,” writes DC Gonzalez in the introductory “Note” to 
, “has everything to do with how well you end up performing.” 
In a nutshell, that’s what this book is all about: to use Timothy Gallwey’s phrase, it is about “
.”
A student of the world-renowned sports and peak performance authority, P.C. Siegel, Daniel Gonzalez is a former Federal Agent, Aviator in the Navy, and Military Cyber-Security Specialist—in addition to being a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Black Belt and a Peak Performance Coach.
So, in other words, he has not only the theoretical knowledge but all the experience necessary to turn you into the Warrior/Champion you can become.
However, in 
he chooses to relay his lessons in a much more communicable way: not via studies and references, but by way of twenty-five story-filled chapters, framed within a single fable—that of DC Gonzalez becoming the Mental Warrior that he is today with the help of his teacher, Leo-tai (correct us if we’re wrong, but we think that P.C. Siegel is hidden behind this name).
It’s a Karate Kid type-of-story (the “D” in DC Gonzalez’s stands for Daniel, and Leo-tai 
 calls him Daniel-san throughout the book), aimed to teach you that after a certain point, you don’t need to develop your skills anymore, but your mental competence to use them.
So, sweeping up the porch and hunting flies with chopsticks is not only useful but also necessary, if you want to become a true Warrior/Champion in your life.
Find out why!
The Three-Minute Lesson
As the mental-edge trainer for university athletics, it was easy for DC Gonzalez to notice which athletes wanted the mental training and which athletes didn’t care. 
He starts his book with one of the latter, let’s call him Jeremy, a freshman interested in only the physical aspects of the sport he practiced: wrestling.
But then, after being drawn to the top-seeded wrestler in the tournament (“a seasoned senior accustomed to annihilating opponents with comparative ease”), he rushed over to DC and started begging for a quick session of mental training. The pressure had gotten the best of him: he had practically lost the match even before it had begun.
DC had no more than three minutes to teach him the basics. And that made all the difference! True, in the end, Jeremy didn’t win, but he lost only by a point, taking the top-seeded wrestler to the distance!
“What he did is not difficult,” says DC Gonzalez, “no magic, no hypnosis, no smoke or mirrors.  I simply guided him through a process with three simple instructions.  I gave him one minute to deal with each instruction, before giving him the next one.  In that short time, he was able to change his state completely.”
The lesson?
It’s all in the head. After all, Jeremy didn’t learn anything wrestling-related per se; and, yet, he evolved from being an already beaten fighter to one capable of challenging the best one in just three minutes!
DC writes:
Gaining the Mental Edge
If you watch soccer, you have probably already heard the name Pelé. 
Widely regarded as one of the best footballers in history, Pelé averaged almost a goal per game throughout his career and lead his national team, Brazil, to three World Cup titles.
Of course, he had exceptional talent, but so did many of the players he played against: Beckenbauer, Puskas, Bobby Moore. And yet, all of them deemed him nothing short of a God.
So, what made him different than the rest? – that’s what DC Gonzalez wondered about for years after watching him play one warm summer night at Tampa Stadium.
And then, he came across a story about him in the writings of the late and great 
, a noted sports mental trainer. In the interview, Pelé shared with Mack what he considered to be the two keys to winning – Enthusiasm and a Mental Edge.
What does that mean in practice?
In three words: mental highlight tapes.
First of all, Pelé, to quote a teammate of his, was “always smiling and upbeat. You never see him bad-tempered.” He had a real enthusiasm for football. He seemed like a guy who’d get up, grab the ball and play a bit even if woken from a deep sleep.
But there was more to it.
You see, Pelé had a routine. Before every game he played, he would go into the locker room about an hour early, reserve a private corner there and lie down using a towel and cover his eyes.
And then, he would start playing 
film in his mind’s eye. It was a film about his beginnings, on the sandy beaches of Brazil, the feelings of sheer joy in his heart every time he’d touch the ball. It was also a film about his greatest moment: the dribbles, the assists, the goals. Finally, it was a film about what was going to happen during the game that followed.
“He imagined everything before it ever happened,” writes Gonzalez, “the crowd, the atmosphere, the field, his own team, his opponents, he saw himself playing irresistibly like a champion—as a force that could not be stopped.  But most important, he told Gary, was to remember that it was not just about vision and imagery, but also about feeling the emotions associated with success.  He pointed out that he vividly imagined how good it all felt.”
Enthusiasm and Mental Edge. These two had already prepared Pelé for greatness long before the physical stretching. You may call it arrogance, but it is not—it is confidence. And there is a big difference.  Confidence is one of the keys to performing well; arrogance—the opposite.
“One must consistently practice mental skills and pre-game routines in order to tap one’s full potential,” concludes DC Gonzalez.
The Critical Three
What Pelé discovered intuitively is something mental trainers no for a fact: 
 makes your mind and your body prepared for precisely that kind of a future. From thereon, the equation is pretty straightforward: negative visualizations bring about negative results; positive visualizations result in glory.
DC Gonzalez writes:
But that is only one of “The Critical Three,” the fundamental tools for the Warrior/Champion according to both Leo-tai and, now, DC Gonzalez!
The first of these Critical Three is something you constantly do, but also something you must do properly if you want to prepare for greatness: breathing.
Of course, we’re not talking about just any kind of breathing: we’re talking about focused breathing, aka the technique most often associated with meditation.
It starts with drawing the air in deeply and slowly to the bottom of your lungs through your nose while expanding the diaphragm.  Then, after holding it momentarily, you need to slowly push the air out of your lungs by drawing the diaphragm in.  
It is important to let the air out through “a relaxed and slightly opened mouth while keeping the tip of the tongue pressed lightly against the ridge behind the front teeth, with the tongue touching the roof of the mouth.”
It is just as important to 
think about anything during the process. Just observe your breathing and pay no attention to anything else. That’s the only way to relax.
Which brings us to the second tool of the Critical Three set.
We’re talking about both mental and physical relaxation. And we’re also talking about deep relaxation.
It is only in the state of deep relaxation that the conscious mind stops controlling everything and makes way for your subconscious mind to take matters in its own hands. And you need this for the final step of the journey: the mental highlights reel.
What does deep relaxation entail?
Well, more or less, what Pelé was doing.
First, it means moving to a quiet place where you can’t be disturbed. So, phones off. Then, lie on your back with your feet slightly apart and your arms slightly extended from your band. Make sure you’re at ease: the place shouldn’t be too cold or too hot, your clothes shouldn’t be tight or uncomfortable.
Now, fix your eyes on a point above you on the ceiling, and take three long, deep breaths through your nose. Feel the wave of relaxation overwhelming you as you exhale them.
Once you exhale the third one, start imagining your eyelids getting heavier. Do so for the length of the next ten breaths, while you’re repeating mentally the word “deeper.” 
Now, it’s time you started relaxing your muscles, starting with your toes and moving upward. Focus on relaxing each of them. Visualize each muscle loosening, and feel the wave of relaxation moving through your body. Allow yourself to be relaxed.
Don’t rush it, don’t think about it, and don’t force anything. And don’t worry if you fall asleep. In case that happens, imagine a staircase with five steps going up and you slowly climbing up the steps. Tell yourself that you’ll feel “more refreshed, more alert, and more aware” with each step you take. When you reach the last one, you’ll wake—rejuvenated and ready to take on the day.
However, once again, don’t rush things: allow yourself to be relaxed for about twenty minutes—even a little more than that.
Now, in the state of deep relaxation, you’ve opened “a direct channel to your subconscious mind,” and you’re ready to “feed it images and feelings of success.”
In other words, you’re ready to write, star in, direct and edit your “movie,” the one that describes how you’ve accomplished what you have so far and shows how you’ll accomplish even greater things very soon.
Just 20 minutes of deep relaxation is enough to prepare you for the final step of your journey to mental preparedness. Imagineering has to come from within you because only then it actually affects motivation and volition.
Show your goals and objectives to the conscious mind, and it will find thousands of reasons not to believe them. Show them to your subconscious mind, and it accepts the input as being true. Afterward, it sets out to help you make it come true.
Yup, that’s what DC Gonzalez is saying: “Fake it until you make it.” But that actually works. After all, it is what one of the greatest authorities on our subconscious mind, Timothy Wilson, has demonstrated in

Key Lessons from “The Art of Mental Training”

2.      The Fundamentals of Mental Training: The Critical Three

Enthusiasm and Mental Edge Are Keys to Winning (Says Pelé)
This is how Guardiola, one of the greatest football coaches in history, motivates young players when necessary: “Each night when you are going to sleep,” 
, “ask yourselves if, right then, you’d get up, grab the ball and play for a bit. If ever the answer is ‘no’ then that is the day to start looking for something else to do.”
Because the key to winning is not merely talent or hard work—it’s also enthusiasm. If you want to do something, you will do it better.
And if you want to excel at it, use the routine practiced by Pelé before each of his games: imagine yourself excelling. Play out the game in your head before you even run out to the field. Because that’s how you get a mental edge.
The Fundamentals of Mental Training: The Critical Three
“The Mental Warrior learns about focused breathing, relaxation, and imagery,” said once his teacher to DC Gonzalez, “and then he sets off to actually use them.”
Because these are the critical three tools to achieving greatness. Set aside between half an hour and an hour before each game for a routine which includes these three aspects of mental training.
That way, you’ll convince yourself that you’re ready for whatever comes next. And your subconscious mind will do everything to help you when the moment of truth comes.
The Three-Minute Lesson, Revisited
Remember Jeremy, the wrestler DC Gonzalez transformed with a three-minute talk before his first match?
Well, Gonzalez comes back to the story later in the book and reveals what he had actually told him. Unsurprisingly, it has a lot to do with the three critical elements explained above, this time, compressed and put into impromptu use.
“
,” DC Gonzalez said to Jeremy. “Whatever state that may be, your own thoughts put you there. “
“So, whenever you find yourself in a disempowered state remember this,” he goes on, “you can alter your thoughts and your state by focusing on three different critical elements:”
• 
: Ask yourself, “What would the self-talk of a champion sound like as he prepared for competition?” If you need some inspiration, here’s what Gonzalez told Jeremy to use as the basis for his pep-talk: “I’m strong, I’m fast, and I dominate.  I control the match, I never give in, and I never give up.  I’m powerful, I’m a force of fury, I’m a force of dominance, and I am a champion.”
• 
: Ask yourself, “How would a champion’s body be moving as he prepared for battle?” Even if 
, it certainly shapes how your opponent sees you, right?
• 
: Ask yourself, “And how would that champion be breathing as he prepared to enter the competition and face his opponent?” You have the answer above.

We know that, legacy-wise, you know almost everything about Steve Jobs. 
But we bet that you know almost nothing about him as a father.
If you want to learn – be our guest: we sum up for you a book by one of his children, Lisa Brennan-Jobs.
It is a memoir of her upbringing—and it is fascinating:

Who Should Read “Small Fry”? And Why?
Steve Jobs is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable icons of the computer revolution and the 20
 century as a whole. Yet, as it often happens in the case of great men who create history, not much is known about him when it comes to more common, more everyday, and let’s just say, more banal things.
Lisa Brennan-Jobs, one of Steve’s three daughters (and four children in all), tells her story in 
, a book that has surely already piqued the fancy of all those Mac fans out there, and a book that will certainly interest anyone who wants to learn something more about how Steve Jobs was as a father.
Be prepared, however: if you love Jobs, this book may plant a seed of doubt in your heart; and if you hate him—then here you’ll find quite a lot to criticize him about.

“Small Fry PDF Summary”
You know him as the man who brought you Macintosh, Pixar, and the iPod, you know him as the creative genius who started the microchip revolution of the 1970s. But do you know him as a father of four children?
One of them—the first, in fact—Lisa Brennan-Jobs decided to recount to the world her side of the story of Jobs in the tellingly titled memoir, 
.
The title is taken from Shakespeare’s 
 and refers to the hierarchy of fish: just as is among the people, says one fisherman to another in the plays, “the great ones eat up the little ones” in the sea as well. The former are whales, the latter small fry.
You can guess which one of the two was Steve, and which one Lisa Brennan-Jobs.
Here’s the full explanation why!
Lisa Brennan-Jobs, the Accidental Daughter That Shouldn’t Have Been
In the spring of 1972, in his senior year at Homestead High School in Cupertino, California, Steve Jobs met Chrisann Brennan, a junior. Very soon he won her love, courtesy of Bob Dylan’s “Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands,” and a little assisting on a Claymation she and her friends were working on at the time.
Soon after, Job left for Reed College in Oregon, and by 1973, their relationship was, to use a popular adjective, complicated. “I couldn’t break the connection, and I couldn’t commit,” says Chrisann about that time. “Steve couldn’t either.”
Little by little, the two separated, but they couldn’t break up completely for the next few years. “I had suggested to Steve that we separate,” said Chrisann many years later, “but he told me that he just couldn’t bring himself to say good-bye.” 
Their on-again-off-again relationship would eventually result in something neither of them expected: just when they were about to break up, Chrisann found out that she was pregnant.
After finding out the news, Steve’s face turned ugly, and he left the room furious and fuming. It was soon after that he started declining paternity. He wasn’t even present at the birth of Lisa on a friend’s farm in Organ.
When he eventually came a few days later, Steve started telling everyone at the farm that the kid is not his, even though she sure looked like him according to everyone present.
Denying Paternity and Paying $0 for Child Support—Until Apple Goes IPO
Steve continued to deny paternity of Lisa for years, and Chrisann had no choice but to break up with him and raise their daughter alone. 
She wanted to become a painter, but there was no time for that: she went on welfare and started earning additional money with waitressing and house cleaning jobs. Steve barely even visited her. Needless to add, he didn’t even bother helping her financially.
Consequently, in 1980, Chrisann sued Steve for not paying child support, and as a result, a DNA paternity test was arranged. The results were conclusive: he was Lisa’s father with 94.4% certainty.
The court of San Mateo—case filed under number 239948—ordered Jobs to cover all welfare back payments (about $6,000) and to pay a monthly allowance of $385 for Lisa, in addition to medical insurance until her 18
 birthday.
The case dragged on for months, and then, suddenly, Steve, via his lawyers, offered to start paying $500 per month for Lisa and cover her health insurance until 18, effectively bringing the case to a close in just a few days. 
Chrisann didn’t know why he had rushed the case to a conclusion, but she didn’t have to wait long to find out: only four days after it was finalized, on December 12, 1980, Apple went public and overnight my Steve was worth more than two hundred million dollars.
Being the Girl with all the A’s and No Marketable Skills
Chrisann loved Lisa, but, as time passed, she was growing ever more frustrated with her life: while she was struggling to make ends meet, almost friendless and alone, Steve Jobs became 
 “Person of the Year,” and the whole world found out that Chrisann was someone who slept around, so their child could always be someone else’s despite the results of the DNA test.
Of course, this reflected on Lisa and, one day, when she was 13 years old, her school had no choice but to call Lisa’s completely disinterested father, Steve, to take her in; otherwise, they said, they would have no option but to call Social Services.
Lisa had always hoped that one day she would be able to live with her famous father and, now, that actually came true.
There was one condition, though: she wasn’t allowed to contact her mother during the following six months.
Lisa agreed to this, as she did to the offer of changing her surname. She didn’t want to hurt her mother, though, so she took both of her parents’ surnames, and became Lisa Brennan-Jobs.
Living with Steve and his new family—his new wife Lauren and their son, Reed—was never the picnic Lisa had hoped her. For example, no matter how much she tried impressing her father—by excelling at school and taking countless extracurricular activities—Steve was never particularly impressed with her.
On the contrary, in fact: he regularly told her that she will probably never amount to anything in her life, even after Lisa eventually got into Harvard. 
“The thing is, Lis,” he said to her once, in a slow voice which always meant that he was about to say something incisive and devastating, “you have no marketable skills. Not one.”
Drifting Apart for the Second Time
Though begrudgingly, Steve Jobs agreed to pay for Lisa’s Harvard tuition after she got in. But he hadn’t changed his mind over her future. In fact, he kept making quite cruel jokes about it.
For example, several times, while driving by it with Lauren next to him and Lisa and Reed in the back, he would point in the direction of a squat building with “Ruby’s” marquee on it, and say something along the lines of “That’s where Lis is going to work.”
Years later, Lisa found out that “Ruby’s” was a strip club. She writes in 
:
In other words, Steve Jobs wanted to start a tech revolution and didn’t want to raise a child. When Lisa happened, he decided to ignore the event. And even after he succeeded and was worth millions, Lisa was still a blot on what he believed was an exceptional life. 
Possibly to erase the guilt he was secretly feeling, Steve kept saying to Lisa things like “You’re not being part of this family.” Once he said this after Lisa refused to go with the family to a Cirque du Soleil show. What followed was something even stranger: “And if you don’t want to be, then you need to move.”
And just like that, Lisa had no choice but to move.
(The Light at) The End of the Road
Believe it or not, after that Cirque du Soleil event, Steve severed ties with Lisa altogether! He even stopped paying her Harvard tuition. 
Fortunately, Steve’s neighbors, the exemplary Kevin and Dorothy, took Lisa under their wings. They not only offered her a place to stay, but Kevin also paid for her final year’s tuition so that she can graduate from Harvard!
Steve Jobs just disappeared: no messages, no phone calls, no responses to any of Lisa’s emails. It went on like that for a while, but then the contact was renewed. After Lisa graduated, Steve paid Kevin for everything he had financed for Lisa.
Years later, Steve Jobs was sick with cancer, and Lisa realized that she was about to lose her father. She visited him often, and he used one of these opportunities to apologize to her for the way he had treated her.
Fortunately, by that time, Lisa could be much surer that he wasn’t lying. In 2005, six years before Jobs succumbed to cancer, they went to visit Bono at his villa.
Bono was interested in finding more about the beginning of Apple. And, then suddenly, he posed a question Lisa had rarely dared to: “So was the Lisa computer named after her?”
“There was a pause,” she writes. “I braced myself—prepared for his answer.” Chrisann had always insisted that the computer was named after her, but both Steve and Lauren denied this. 
At Bono’s villa, Steve hesitated for a few moments, looked down at his plate, and then looked back at Bono. “Yeah, it was,” he said.
“I studied my father’s face,” Lisa goes on. “What had changed? Why had he admitted it now, after all these years?”
“That’s the first time he’s said yes,” Lisa told Bono. “Thank you for asking.” 
Key Lessons from “Small Fry”
1.      Steve Jobs Never Wanted to Admit Paternity of Lisa… Even After a DNA Test
2.      Steve Jobs Started Paying Alimony for Lisa Only Because of Apple
3.      Apple Lisa Was Named After Lisa Brennan-Jobs
Steve Jobs Never Wanted to Admit Paternity of Lisa… Even After a DNA Test
Steve Jobs didn’t want to have a daughter with Chrisann Brennan, a painter. However, that happened: due to the body of Chrisann rejecting a contraceptive, she got pregnant in 1977 and gave birth to Lisa Brennan-Jobs next year, at 23.
This was not part of Steve Jobs’ plans at the time, which is why he started publicly denying paternity. Because of this, Chrisann ended the relationship with him and started working as a cleaning lady to earn enough money for her and Lisa. Steve Jobs contributed with nothing.
Finally, a DNA paternity test established that he is the father with 94.4% certainty. It didn’t matter: he refused to acknowledge the test, claiming, in a subsequent interview for 
magazine that “28% of the male population of the United States could be the father.”
Steve Jobs Started Paying Alimony for Lisa Only Because of Apple
Since Jobs was so sure that he wasn’t the father of Lisa, he refused to pay alimony for her. Even more: he claimed that her mother didn’t even want the money but him, as if that is some kind of a monstrous thing.
And then, suddenly, even though Chrisann had asked for $385 a month, Steve Jobs agreed to pay to her $500 a month. Not because of some newfound fatherly feelings. Apple was supposed to go public in four days: little did anyone know that Jobs was about to become a multimillionaire.
Apple Lisa Was Named After Lisa Brennan-Jobs
Despite his public rejection of Lisa, privately, Steve had feelings for her. People said that he carried a picture of her in his wallet. Even more, he named one of the earliest GUI-based computers after her: Apple Lisa.
Of course, he claimed for most of his life that it is merely an acronym for “Locally Integrated Software Architecture,” but, during a discussion with U2’s Bono (at which Lisa was also present), Jobs confirmed that Apple Lisa was named after his daughter.
He confirmed that story publicly near the end of his life for Walter Isaacson’s majestic biography, 
: “obviously, it was named for my daughter,” he admitted.

“Super Brain PDF Summary”
You’ve probably heard 
 that we use only 10% of our brain, and seen quite a few movies based on this premise (such as, say, 
with Bradley Cooper, and 
with Scarlett Johansson).
Though disproven by thousands of studies in terms of the number, there is some truth to this myth: most of us don’t 
 use the full capacity of our brains.
Because, simply put, we don’t challenge ourselves to do that. If 
 and 
, it’s not impossible to achieve, in time, well, the impossible.
In 
, Deepak Chopra and Rudolph Tanzi reveal several ways through which you can tap into this amazing power and put this wasted potential to use.
And here are our highlights!
Adding a Neuron or Two to Your Brain Is Not That Difficult
Remember that time when you came home drunk, and your father told you the next morning that you’ve lost overnight thousands of neurons in your brain?
Well, he was right. But the truth—the whole truth—is that he was also very wrong.
We lose about 85,000 neurons a day, regardless of our drinking habits! That may sound like a large number, but, in reality, it’s nothing: there are around 100 billion neurons in your brain!
In other words, at this loss rate, you’ll be able to live the life of a brilliant mathematician even if 
! In simpler terms, there are just enough neurons in your brain to get you through life even if they don’t regenerate!
Did we just say “even if”?
Yes, we did!
The notion that the brain cells are the only cells in our body that don’t regenerate is, according to Chopra and Tanzi, just another myth. In reality, the human brain creates new cells all the time.
And studies have conclusively demonstrated this!
For example, neurologist Paul Coleman of the University of Rochester discovered that, despite the loss rate of 85,000 neurons per day, the brains of a twenty-year-old and a seventy-year-old person have pretty much the same number of functioning neurons!
But, then again, some old people have more functioning neurons than others.
Why is that?
Because they have trained them better!
Just like your body needs physical exercise if you want to get a six-pack, your brain needs some mental exercise to develop extra neurons. This happens at a faster rate when you’re faced with a new assignment, such as a math problem or a new language.
And humans are not the only species where this has been observed!
For example, an average male zebra finch, the most common Australian bird of its kind, has more brain neurons during the mating season because it must learn new songs to attract the females.
The Two Es: Exercising and Experiencing
True, mental exercise does wonders to the structure of your brain, but, 
, physical exercise boosts brain power as well. 
It may seem counter-intuitive, but it is an undeniable fact that people who are more active are far less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease in their old age.
But it’s more than that:
There is yet another way to help your cells become part of the world: by allowing them to experience new things and opinions.
Most people do the exact opposite: they follow a certain routine and don’t want to go outside the filter bubble they are trapped in. After all, it 
 safer that way: evolution has taught us that it is always better to stick with the known than explore the unknown: the former means safety, the latter may mean danger.
However, it is the 21
 century, and things have certainly changed! There are no more mammoths or saber-toothed tigers roaming around, nor it is dangerous to talk to someone you don’t agree with. In fact, 
.
So, do that! 
Go out, travel, read, talk to people who hold opinions opposite of yours! 
Your brain will love that!
The Benefits of a Super Brain
Turning your brain into a super brain won’t get you superpowers of the kind depicted in 
and 
. But it may help you take control of some of your habits and become a happier, more fulfilled person. 
And what could be more important than that? 
After all, what is life itself, but a series of habits?
Here are three benefits of developing a super brain!
We look the way we do, and our brain works the way it does because of evolution. However, evolving was such a long process which had to take care of so many things that it isn’t at all surprising that sometimes our bodies can work against us.
The case of staying closed to new experiences because we’ve evolved to prefer safety over vulnerability isn’t the only one. As we’ve only recently discovered, your inability to stick to a diet may be another case when your body works against you.
Why?
Because of a hormone called “ghrelin.”
Australian scientists found out that this hormone—referred colloquially as “the hunger hormone”—starts producing when you lose weight and makes you feel desperately hungry. That’s the feeling you get after being on a diet for a few months.
You see the vicious circle: once you lose some weight, ghrelin starts producing and says to you that you’re hungry, and, before you know it, you gain the lost weight once again!
However, you can control this feedback loop by merely controlling the thought process. Ghrelin says that you’re hungry? Start replying: “I’m not.” In time, it will stop producing—after all, almost all commands come from the same place, your brain.
“The first rule of super brain is that your brain is always eavesdropping on your thoughts,” write Chopra and Tanzi. “As it listens, it learns. If you teach it about limitation, your brain will become limited. But what if you do the opposite? What if you teach your brain to be unlimited?”
Speaking of limitations, one of the obvious ones is not being able to predict the result of some of our actions. We know what will happen if we drop a glass to the floor, but we have no idea what will happen if we vote for a certain person at next year’s elections.
Well, not exactly!
There is something inside us that is able to predict the future. We call it intuition, and though we don’t know how it works, it seems to be working quite well. As Tim Wilson demonstrated 
(something Malcolm Gladwell popularized in 
), sometimes we think better when we don’t think at all.
Chopra and Tanzi tell of an experiment during which participants were asked to look at some photographs, only a few of which depicted a violent scene. Naturally, the mere look at one of these violent images incited stressful responses in the participants, and the extent of these responses was properly registered by relevant devices.
After some time, something strange happened: people started feeling these things microseconds before the violent images appeared on the screen. And only then!
How did they know?
Is it possible that we can know about the future more than we think we can? Is our brain capable of seeing into it—but we still don’t know how to exploit this power?
Train your brain through mental and physical exercises, tap into its power through healthy eating habits and being open to new experiences, and yet, you might end up being just a smart, lonely individual or, to be brutally honest, an unhappy intellectual with a wife and two children.
Why would you need to train your brain for that?
Aristotle was the first one to suggest that 
 and that everything else is merely a way to achieve it. And very few have disagreed with him throughout the past twenty-five centuries. 
Well, Chopra and Tanzi start from there and explain how the reason why so many people are unhappy today (despite a million-dollar industry related to happiness and thousands of books which explore it) is actually quite straightforward: the definition of happiness our brains are infested with is fundamentally wrong.
Most people, you see, equate happiness with external factors: finding the perfect partner, having children, earning a million dollars, becoming a famous person. The truth is that none of these things will bring you happiness even if you obtain them, because happiness lives inside your brain.
In other words, happiness is the result of aligning your goals to your personal values—and nothing more! This may mean for someone raising horses, and for another person reading poetry. There is no universally applicable equation!
Take Brendon Grimshaw, for example. He was quite a successful journalist, but he decided to quit his job because it wasn’t as fulfilling as he had hoped for. Then he bought an abandoned tropical island (the Moyenne Island in the Indian Ocean) and became its personal caretaker.
During the next few decades, Grimshaw turned this island into a wildlife refuge for many animals (such as the giant tortoise) by constantly planting mahogany trees there.
Some would say that living such a solitary life (he was the island’s only inhabitant) is anything but happiness, but not Grimshaw: the moment he left, he never looked back. He stayed there until 2012, when he died a happy man.
The lesson?
Find your island of happiness, and move there!
Key Lessons from “Super Brain”
1.      The Brain Constantly Loses and Creates Neurons
2.      Fight Alzheimer By Exercising Regularly
3.      Develop a Super Brain by Learning New Languages and Experiencing More
The Brain Constantly Loses and Creates Neurons
On average, your brain loses about 85,000 neurons a day!
The good thing is that it has about 100 billion of them, so it’s not such a big loss.
An even better thing is that the brain of a 20-year-old and that of a 70-year-old person have pretty much the same number of neurons.
How’s that possible?
You’ve guessed it alright: just as it loses, the brain also regenerates and recreates neurons on a daily basis.
Fight Alzheimer By Exercising Regularly
It is not at all surprising that mental exercises (solving math problems or playing chess, for example) creates neurons.
But studies have shown that the same holds true for physical exercising as well.
In fact, it is one of the few proven ways to fight Alzheimer: the more regularly you exercise while you are young, the less likely to develop Alzheimer in your old age.
Develop a Super Brain by Learning New Languages and Experiencing More
Scientists have observed that the brains of zebra finches (an Australian bird) grow larger during the mating season because it has to learn new songs to attract mates.
The same thing applies to humans: the more you use your brain, the better it works.
So, learn new songs and languages, read, write, and experience new things as often as you can! Staying in your comfort zone does your brain disservice; life is what happens outside of it.

“Super Brain Quotes”
Our Critical Review
Described as “a mixture of recent research in the neurosciences and spiritual wisdom passed down through generations,” by Kirkus Reviews, 
is a strange book. 
At times it seems to be in sync with the most recent findings in science, but, at other times, it seems nothing more but a collection of “platitudes and value judgments,” neither of which are verifiable and most of which seem just too speculative.
Great for Chopra fans, but subpar for a scientist of Rudolph Tanzi’s stature. "

“The Voice of Knowledge PDF Summary”
They say that knowledge is power.
Don Miguel Ruiz thinks that this is one of the many lies you’re fed with on a daily basis.
“What is truth is real,” he writes in the epigraph to 
. “What is not truth is not real. It’s an illusion, but it looks real. Love is real. It’s the supreme expression of life.”
And love is precisely what is at stake: due to the many lies we’ve grown to believe to be true in our lives, we have forgotten how to love and, with that, how to live as well.
The voice of knowledge from the title of Don Miguel Ruiz’s 2004 book is not, as you might expect, a voice of God; it is, actually, the voice of the prince of darkness separating you from your very own self.
Consequently, it is one you should almost never listen to.
And here’s why in detail.
The Symbolic Meaning of the Story of Adam and Eve
Since everybody knows the story, we can sum it up in just a few sentences:
So, Adam and Eve were created by God, placed in the Garden of Eden, and told that the only thing they are not allowed to do is eat from the Tree of Death, aka the Tree of Knowledge. Of course, they did just that, and, before you can say “why, God, why?“ they fell from grace and became ordinary suffering humans.
Expectedly, Don Miguel Ruiz is interested in the story from a different perspective. “It explains with symbolism what I will try to explain with words,” he says in the first chapter of 
“The story of Adam and Eve,” he goes on, “is based on absolute truth, though I never understood it as a child. It is one of the greatest teachings ever, but I believe that most people misunderstand it.”
The story is, in fact, he says, about 
: Adam and Eve were every single human being that existed at the time of Creation, so the story is not about them exclusively, but about humanity in general.
And it says this:
We are born innocent and in Paradise; everything is about joy, freedom, and eternal love when we are children; we live in perfect harmony with all of creation.
But then, the Prince of Lies sneaks in from somewhere and, bringing a message of fear, convinces us to try the tempting fruits from the Tree of Knowledge. The fruits of knowledge are poisonous because they bring with them thousands of lies. The minute we start eating these fruits, the lies start living 
 us.
“The mind is fertile ground for concepts, ideas, and opinions,” writes Ruiz. “If someone tells us a lie and we believe it, that lie takes root in our mind and can grow big and strong, like a tree. One little lie can be very contagious, spreading its seeds from person to person when we share it with others.”
The Simple Truth of Existence (and Miguel’s Visit to His Grandfather)
When Miguel was a teenager, he once went to visit his grandfather in an attempt to share with him what he had learned at school. 
His grandfather, a shaman nearly 90 years of age at the time, listened very carefully to Miguel’s stories “about all of the injustice in the world, about the poverty, about the violence, about the conflict between good and what [he] then called evil.”
“Well, Miguel, those are very good theories that you’ve learned,” his grandfather replied. “But they are only theories. Everything you have told me is just a story. It doesn’t mean that it’s true.”
Now it was Ruiz’s turn to listen. And his grandfather started explaining to him:
Miguel was startled and surprised. But that’s not where his grandfather ended his story.
Instead, he proceeded to explain how humans overcomplicate things, and how this is also the result of lies, the biggest one among them that we are not created perfect.
It’s the other way around: we are created perfect, but we fall from grace because, through our knowledge, we let lies infest our being. And they gradually separate us from ourselves, because we start believing in them and stop believing in us.
The only way for us to know the truth is by experiencing it. Everything else is just a product of our mind, which can never be free of lies. 
“We can perceive truth with our feelings, but as soon as we try to describe it with words, we distort it, and it’s no longer the truth,” said Miguel’s grandfather to the teenage Ruiz. 
And at that moment, he knew that he had experienced something that would eventually evolve into this book.
The Lie of Our Imperfection
This, the lie of our imperfection, is the big lie, the one undermining everyone’s existence, the one causing the chaos in the world.
When we are children, writes Ruiz, we are completely in tune with our selves. We are authentic and never try to pretend that we are something we are not. We are, simply put, incapable of it.
“When the child was a child,” to quote the exquisitely beautiful movie, 
, “it didn’t know that it was a child: to it, everything had a soul, and all souls were one. When the child was a child, it had no opinion about anything, had no habits… and made no faces when photographed.”
Well, this all changes when we become mature enough to be capable of learning abstract things and ideas. Because with them comes the emptiness as well: suddenly, we get the feeling that some people know more about the world than us and that we lack something (i.e., knowledge).
And we start inventing stories about what is good and what is bad, about what is love and what is hate, about who we are and what we are not. Of course, all of them are nothing more than stories: just like one who has never experienced love can never understand it if merely described, we can never understand anything (even ourselves) if we don’t experience it in entirety.
Think of it this way: 
If, theoretically, a single individual is drawn by Leonardo da Vinci, Picasso, and Dali, few would be able to guess that their portraits depict the same person.
Why?
Because they all see that person in a different way, noticing very different things in him/her.
And that’s how much our stories differ. Some are more appealing to the majority, while others can only be appreciated by a selected minority. This doesn’t make them true. In fact, nothing does. They will always be nothing more than stories.
“Humans are born in truth,” notes Don Miguel Ruiz, “but we grow up believing in lies. One of the biggest lies in the story of humanity is the lie of our imperfection. It’s just a story, but we believe it, and we use the story to judge ourselves, to punish ourselves, and to justify our mistakes.”
Be the Storyteller of Your Life
To sum up the argument so far:
Just like Adam and Eve, we are created perfect. This must be true, because we are created by God in His image, and God is necessarily perfect. And we know this for a fact 
 as children.
However, we start forgetting this as soon as we start listening to the voice of knowledge, which Ruiz describes as a wild horse taking us wherever 
 wants to go.
The voice of knowledge exposes us to the illusion of what the world is: we start believing things that we have never experienced, and the real knowledge can only come through experience. So, in other words, with the voice of knowledge come the lies.
The greatest one among them: that we are imperfect by birth and need to spend a lot of time and energy to perfect ourselves.
“What you call 
,” writes Ruiz, “is the voice of knowledge making up stories, telling you what you know, and trying to make sense out of everything you don’t know. The problem is that the voice makes you do many things that go against yourself.”
You can change that!
Merely knowing that “you are the author of an ongoing story you tell yourself” is a great start. Because the good thing about stories is that they can be 
.
The main character of 
story is, of course, none other than you. Everyone else is a secondary character whose story, in relation to you, depends upon the story you believe you are in.
“The only way to change your story is to change what you believe about yourself,” writes Ruiz. “If you clean up the lies you believe about yourself, the lies you believe about everybody else will change. Every time you change the main character of your story, the whole story changes to adapt to the new main character.”
Knowing that you are a character in a story helps in fashioning a better relationship to the people around you.
In their stories, you are a secondary character, just as they are in yours. If you try to write their story for them, you don’t respect them. If they try to write your story for you—they don’t respect you.
We are born to write only 
 perfect story: that of ourselves. So, don’t waste your time taking anything personally: when other people are interacting with you, they are really interacting with the secondary characters in their story.
And even Shakespeare wasn’t that great in creating three-dimensional secondary characters. 
Key Lessons from “The Voice of Knowledge”
1.      We Are Born Perfect
2.      The Voice of Knowledge Interferes with Our Experience of Ourselves
3.      You Can Write Your Own Story
We Are Born Perfect
Since God is perfect, perfect is the only form in which he could have fashioned us. 
Consequently, the greatest lie ever told is the one of our imperfection: we cannot be someone else even if we tried.
“We are born perfect, we grow up perfect, and we will die perfect, because only perfection exists,” writes Ruiz trying to recapture the words of his grandfather, a shaman. 
“But the big lie is that you are not perfect, that nobody is perfect. So you start to search for an 
 of perfection that you can never become. You will never reach perfection in that way because that image is false. It’s a lie, but you invest your faith in that lie, and then you build a whole structure of lies to support it.”
The Voice of Knowledge Interferes with Our Experience of Ourselves
Truth can only be experienced. When put into words, it is not truth anymore: it is merely a distorted version of the experience.
When we are children, we know this very well: we live in the present, and we live authentically. We are what we are: beings full of love and innocence.
However, once we grow mature enough to understand abstract things, we start 
too much. And we start believing that there are all kinds of things in the world which affect us: what is just and what is unjust, what is good and what is bad, what is beautiful and what is ugly.
These things, however, don’t exist in the world: they are not real for the flowers or the stars or the lions. In other words, they are a product of our minds.
Instead of working for us, as soon as we separate them from our experiences, our minds start working against us, concocting stories which are false and which infest our happiness.
You Can Write Your Own Story
The good thing is that we can always rewrite our story—using our point of view as the be-all and end-all.
“All humans create their story with their own unique point of view,” writes Ruiz. “Why try to impose your story on other people when for them your story is not true? When you understand that, you no longer have the need to defend what you believe. It’s not important to be right or to make others wrong.”
“Instead, you see everybody as an artist, a storyteller. You know that whatever they believe is just their point of view. It has nothing to do with you.”

Published one year before

Trump in the White House
More than four decades ago, Bob Woodward, perhaps America’s greatest investigative journalist, almost singlehandedly 
.
Now, he seems to be back for another. 
 as we take a look with him at the inner workings of the fairly dysfunctional Trump administration.
As you’ll find out, it operates on the most primal human instinct:
.
Who Should Read “Fear”? And Why?
Donald Trump doesn’t have a very good opinion for most of USA’s respected journalists, but even he has said some nice words about Bob Woodward in the past. And when we say “in the past,” we do mean “in the past”: he seems to have changed his mind ever since 
was published.
Some say it is because the book portrayed him too authentically, others because parts of it are fabricated. If you want to find out, you’ll have to read the book yourself.
Also, do read it if you care about America or want to understand what’s happening in the White House. Even the highest echelons in the government are having a hard time disproving some of Woodward’s allegations, and even if half of them are true—it’s a jungle in there, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C.
And not the fun kind.
About Bob Woodward
 is an American investigative journalist.
He has worked for 
ever since 1971 and is currently an associate editor at the newspaper. He started his stellar career with possibly the most famous scoop in the history of American journalism: the Watergate scandal.
Dubbed “maybe the single greatest reporting effort of all time,” Woodward’s original news reporting on this scandal (with Cal Bernstein) made him an idol of generations of journalists. It later became the material for two of his bestselling books,

In addition to these, he has written 17 more books on American politics, such as

“Fear PDF Summary”
On March 31, 2016, at the Old Post Office Pavilion, Trump International Hotel, Washington, D.C., in an interview with Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, then-presidential candidate Donald J. Trump uttered a chilling sentence:
Hence the title of Bob Woodward’s book, published two and a half years later (on September 11, 2018) to widespread acclaim in the liberal media (and general disdain on the other side).
The book
sold over one million copies in the first week of its publication (making it the fastest-selling opener in the history of Simon & Schuster) and is still, one year later, as divisive as it had been even when it was announced that it’s been in the workings.
True, as Woodward explains in a “Note to the Readers” which prefaces the book, 
is not based on conversations with Trump (who declined to be interviewed for the book), but is “drawn from hundreds of hours of interviews with firsthand participants and witnesses to these events.”
“Nearly all allowed me to tape-record our interviews,” he goes on, “so the story could be told with more precision. When I have attributed exact quotations, thoughts or conclusions to the participants, that information comes from the person, a colleague with direct knowledge, or from meeting notes, personal diaries, files and government or personal documents.”
Even so, some (White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and Secretary of Defense James Mattis) have denied making the claims attributed to them in the book, and Trump has called its stories “made up” and said that they have “a lot of credibility issues.”
Be that as it may, 
was written by Woodward, and is so frightening it deserves serious consideration.
And here is why.
Mr. Trump’s Aides Do Not Have a Very High Opinion of Him
Whether you love him or hate him (there’s no middle ground with him, is there?), we think saying that Trump is not the sharpest tool in the shed is a fair 
 of his intellectual capabilities.
There are people out there who believe that all of that is just a ploy and that Trump knows precisely what he’s doing at all times, but, at least according to 
, even behind the curtains, Trump is what he is in public.
And the people around him can’t believe this!
Here’s, for example, the summary of a Korea-related meeting (read below about the meeting itself) by an anonymous White House official quoted by Woodward in Chapter 27:
And “extremely concerned” doesn’t even tell half of the story!
Most of Trump’s advisors, at least as portrayed in the book, are either fed up with him or so frustrated with his opinions and doings they are all but incapable of juggling between their personas anymore.
For example, White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly—rumored to be close to resigning for some time now—supposedly once referred to Trump as “unhinged,” and, another time, in a small group meeting in his office, uttered these words about him:
“He’s an idiot. It’s pointless to try to convince him of anything. He’s gone off the rails. We’re in crazytown. I don’t even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I’ve ever had.”
We wrote “supposedly” above because, at least 
, “it’s exactly the opposite,” and the story is “another pathetic attempt to smear people close to President Trump and distract from the administration’s many successes.
John Kelly may have retracted his statement (Woodward still claims that it is both accurate and verifiable), Rex Tillerson has yet to say something similar. And his description of Trump is even more damning.
Named Secretary of State by Trump in December 2016, Tillerson regularly clashed with the President, something which culminated on March 13, 2018, when he was fired from his office.
But there’s a good chance he was already thinking about resigning long before. 
After a meeting during which Trump suggested to the US military a tenfold increase of the United States nuclear arsenal—something that would cost a lot of money and take hundreds of years to complete—in a discussion with Priebus, Tillerson called Trump a “moron.”
“I just don’t like the way the president talks to these generals,” he supposedly said. They don’t deserve it. I can’t sit around and listen to this from the president. He’s just a moron.”
“It was challenging for me coming from the disciplined, highly process-oriented Exxon Mobil corporation,” Tillerson would say to Bob Schieffer in an interview after leaving the Trump administration, “to go to work for a man who is pretty undisciplined, doesn’t like to read, doesn’t read briefing reports, doesn’t like to get into the details of a lot of things, but rather just kind of says, ‘This is what I believe.’”
And that’s not just Tillerson’s assessment.
Think it’s easy talking to Trump?
Not according to his associates: it’s basically the same discussion over and over again! Because Trump just doesn’t listen to anyone but himself. You know… like children.
“Grievance was a big part of Trump’s core,” writes Woodward in Chapter 36, “very much like a 14-year-old boy who felt he was being picked on unfairly. You couldn’t talk to him in adult logic. Teenage logic was necessary.”
Supposedly, Secretary of Defense James Mattis is particularly exasperated and alarmed by this trait of the President, telling close associates that Trump acts like (and has the understanding of) “a fifth or sixth-grader.”
Speaking of which…
Trump and His Tweets
Trump may not be a dedicated reader, but he’s certainly a great consumer and lover of all forms of media.
“During Trump’s first six months in the White House, few understood how much media he consumed,” writes Woodward. “It was scary,” he adds. Trump didn’t show up for work until 11:00 in the morning. Many times he watched six to eight hours of television in a day.”
And that’s not all, of course. He also tweets about it—and, as you know full well, about everything else.
The tweets, says Woodward, are not merely incidental to his presidency. They are central.
How central, you ask?
Well, Trump once ordered printouts of all of his recent tweets that had received a high number of likes, north of 200,000.
Why, you ask?
Well, to study them and find the common thread, to discover the themes that make him popular. “He seemed to want to become more strategic,” writes Woodward, “find out whether success was tied to the subject, the language or simply the surprise that the president was weighing in.” 
Unsurprisingly, it turned out that “the most effective tweets were often the most shocking.”
So, Trump went about his business: shocking everybody via his tweets day in day out, despite suggestions to the opposite by his social media director Dan Scavino and his PR specialist Hope Hicks.
In fact, after Trump described Mika Brzezinski, in a scathing 6 a.m., as “bleeding badly from a face-lift”—enraging many women senators—Hicks, Scavino and other top staffers tried setting up a committee with a mission to vet Trump’s “politically unhelpful” tweets.
However, Trump ignored them, because, in his opinion, it is the other way around, Twitter being the reason why he won the election in the first place.
He supposedly said to them:
Unsurprisingly for a man with such a mindset, he honestly believes that he’s also a great composer of tweets. When Tweeter announced doubling the number of permissible characters to 280, Trump supposedly said that though this was pretty nice on one level because it allowed for more depth, it’s also bad on another.
“It’s a good thing,” he is quoted as saying by Woodward, “but it’s a bit of a shame because I was the Ernest Hemingway of 140 characters.”
Stealing Important Documents Under Trump’s Nose (and Saving Two Trade Deals)
No matter what you think about Trump, you can’t deny the fact that he tries hard to be true to his promise to put America first. 
The problem is that, most of the time, experts are not so sure that his attempts to do this could result in the desired outcome. In fact, it’s usually quite the opposite.
While editing a speech with White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter soon after leaving a G20 summit—according to Woodward—Trump scribbled three revealing words on a piece of paper which probably sum up most of his beliefs regarding his job: “Trade is bad.”
“Though he never said it in a speech,” Woodward writes, “he had finally found the summarizing phrase and truest expression of his protectionism, isolationism and fervent American nationalism.”
In reality, however, the world doesn’t work this way. In reality, trading “globalism” for “nationalism” does damage in the long run for everybody, even if it seems beneficial for the trader in the short run.
However, Donald “this-is-what-I-believe” Trump wouldn’t have any of it. His politics, according to Woodward, is actually economics and quite a simple one: trade surplus = good, trade deficit = bad.
And he would do everything to transform the latter in the former, disregarding possible negative outcomes.
Case in point, two years ago, Trump nearly pulled the United States out of two major trade deals: NAFTA and KORUS.
Allegedly, in the spring of 2017, Trump had Rob Porter draft an order to remove the US from NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada, and Mexico), a trilateral trade bloc which is one of the largest in the world by GDP.
Gary Cohn, a Goldman Sachs COO and the chief economic advisor to Trump from 2017 to 2018, and Sonny Perdue, the secretary of agriculture, tried explaining to Trump that this is not a smart thing, since the three economies are tightly integrated, and the US exports $39 billion surplus of products to Mexico and Canada every year.
But Trump doesn’t want explanations: it’s either his way or the highway!
Unless…
“I can stop this,” Cohn said to Porter after realizing that Trump is planning to go all the way with his plan. “I’ll just take the paper off his desk before I leave.” And he later took it. “If he’s going to sign it, he’s going to need another piece of paper,” he said.
Something similar happened in the case of KORUS, the United States–Korea Free Trade Agreement, which eliminates about 95% of each nation’s tariffs on goods and sets the rules for more than $150-billion-worth of trades, involving over 350 million consumers in both countries. 
Cohn tried explaining to Trump that it is due to KORUS that Americans are able to buy “the most amazing TVs in the world for $245,” which is the reason why “people are spending less money on TVs and more money on other products in the United States,” but he used graphs and to do that, and Trump, as noted above, doesn’t understand graphs.
What he does understand, however, is his logic of a teenager, according to which everyone can be wrong but him.
According to Woodward, Trump even signed a letter that would have taken the USA out of KORUS, but, thankfully, Cohn stole it off Trump’s desk.
The President never noticed it was missing.
The Koreas: “We’re Doing This in Order to Prevent World War III”
There is, of course, another aspect of the KORUS agreement that Trump is not that bothered about and that keeps all of his military officers awake at night.
Namely, the US is paying $1 billion a year for an anti-ballistic missile system in South Korea called the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) which is there for two reasons: 1) to protect South Korea and its free-market society from an attack by its communist neighbor on the north, and 2) to protect the USA from a nuclear attack by North Korea.
How so?
Well, the THAAD should detect a missile fired in the direction of the United States in the span of seven seconds if in South Korea, much, much longer than the 15 minutes necessary if the THAAD was located in Alaska.
However, Trump was pretty adamant that the South Koreans are supposed to pay for the THAAD, and that the United States should immediately get rid of its troops in that country.
“We spend $3.5 billion a year to have troops in South Korea,” Trump said once angrily to Cohn. “$3.5 billion, 28,000 troops… I don’t know why they’re there. Let’s bring them all home!”
He thought pretty much the same about THAAD as well, asking that it be relocated to Portland, Oregon. “I informed South Korea it would be appropriate if they paid,” he once said. “It’s a billion-dollar system. It’s phenomenal, shoots missiles right out of the sky.”
The root cause for all of this?
The American $18 billion trade deficit with South Korea!
Amazed at how little Trump cares about world peace, Mattis once said to him something described by Woodward as “a breathtaking statement, a challenge to the president:” ““We’re doing this in order to prevent World War III.”
Still, as in the case of so many other deals, Trump thought that all of that is just an excuse and that Americans are being played like “suckers” by their former enemies, who 
“I think we could be so rich,” Trump said once, “if we weren’t stupid.”
Key Lessons from “Fear”
1.      The President Doesn’t Command Presidential Respect from His (Former) Aides
2.      Trump’s Position on Everything: “Deny, Deny, Deny”
3.      Trump Is Not Fit to Properly Lead USA’s Military
The President Doesn’t Command Presidential Respect from His (Former) Aides
Judging by Woodward’s 
, something’s really rotten in the state of America, since not many of Trump’s associates can bear spending time or having a discussion with him.
Blame it on his teenage logic!
According to James Mattis, Trump has the mind of “a fifth or sixth-grader,” and according to Rex Tillerson, he’s nothing short of a “moron.” “It’s pointless to try to convince him of anything,” supposedly said John F. Kelly, claiming that Trump has “gone off the rails.”
John M. Dowd, then-Trump’s personal lawyer, said something in the same vein in the light of the Mueller investigation, advising him to either not testify or end up with “an orange jump suit.”
All of the above with the exception of Kelly are not part of Trump’s administration anymore. It makes you wonder, doesn’t it?
Trump’s Position on Everything: “Deny, Deny, Deny”
The first rule of talking to Trump: Trump is never wrong.
The second rule of talking to him: when he is (which happens frequently) he’d deny everything 
. 
And he doesn’t even care how negative the thing in question is.
Once, talking to a friend who had made the mistake of acknowledging “some bad behavior toward women,” Trump advised him to never forget that “real power is fear,” and that one is always supposed to be strong:
You know, just like he does on about everything—even when the records show the opposite.
Trump Only Cares About Trade Deficits and Is Not Fit to Properly Lead USA’s Military
Trump once implied to Mattis that he’d sleep like a baby even if North Korea attacks South Korea if he manages to transform the trade deficit toward South Korea in a trade surplus.
Only the theft by Gary Kohn of two already signed documents prevented him from ruining 2 massive trade deals (NAFTA and KORUS)—at least for now—and causing tensions on both the Korean peninsula and across the North American continent.
In addition, he supposedly once told Mattis in a telephone call to kill Syrian president, Bashar al-Asaad—just like that, as if it is a video game. And if that’s not enough, reportedly, Trump once asked Johnny McEntee, his “27-year-old body man,” if he should send more troops to Afghanistan. 
We’re not even going to mention the tweeter war he had with North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un over the size of each other’s nuclear buttons. Because, fortunately, that’s in the past now.

“Fear Quotes”
Our Critical Review
Described by NPR’s Ron Elving as “the best glimpse we have into a White House like no other,” 
is yet another addition to the anti-Trump canon (started by Michael Wolff’s 
and Omarosa Manigault Newman’s 
).
Of course, that means that Trump thinks of it as “just another bad book,” and that most of his supporters believe him rather than Woodward. We side with the latter: Woodward has always been honest in his depictions of previous governments, so there’s no reason to believe this is not the case here.
That, however, means that there are more problems in the White House than one can list, and that, we may be living through “a nervous breakdown of the executive power of the most powerful country in the world.”
For the sake of America and the world, we do hope (for once) that Sarah Huckabee Sanders is right and that the stories in this book are fabricated. 
But we honestly doubt it."

“Between the World and Me PDF Summary”
Emulating the structure of James Baldwin’s 
, Ta-Nehisi Coates’ poetic, touching and piercingly accurate analysis of “racist violence that has been woven into American culture” takes the form of a letter addressed from the author to his fifteen-year-old son, Samori.
The letter is divided into three chapters, the first of which recounts Coates’ experiences as a young man, the second of which talks about his life after the birth of Samori, and the last one of which narrates the author’s visit of Mabel Jones, a grieving mother of a mistakenly murdered African-American friend of Coates.
And we have all of them covered in our summary!
Chapter I
Coates begins his letter to Samori by describing an event from the Sunday before: a host of a popular news show asking him what it means to lose his body.
“Specifically,” the author goes on, “the host wished to know why I felt that white America’s progress, or rather the progress of those Americans who believe that they are white, was built on looting and violence. Hearing this, I felt an old and indistinct sadness well up in me. The answer to this question is the record of the believers themselves. The answer is American history.”
In other words, Coates says that the great country of America exists in large part due to the fact that part of its population was never given the chance to exist. Though Americans deify democracy almost as much as God, most of American history is extremely undemocratic.
In fact, when President Lincoln declared, in 1863, that the battle of Gettysburg must ensure “that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth,” he didn’t have Coates’ grandfather in mind.
According to the laws of the time, Coates’ grandfather, simply and brutally put, wasn’t a person, wasn’t part of the people:
“I write you in your fifteenth year,” says Coates a little below. 
“I am writing you because this was the year you saw Eric Garner choked to death for selling cigarettes; because you know now that Renisha McBride was shot for seeking help, that John Crawford was shot down for browsing in a department store.”
“And you have seen men in uniform drive by and murder Tamir Rice, a twelve-year-old child whom they were oath-bound to protect. And you have seen men in the same uniforms pummel Marlene Pinnock, someone’s grandmother, on the side of a road.”
All these people—Garner, McBride, Crawford, Brown, Pinnock—they were, tautology intended, people, regardless of the color of their skin. And yet, they weren’t treated as such. In the 21
 century. By the most democratic nation on the planet.
The discrepancy is staggering and yet it is an indelible part of the society of the USA, a key component of American history.
It is what the American Dream is built upon: dig deep enough below the promises of success and the rags-to-riches Horatio-Alger-like stories, and you’ll find African-American bodies, lifeless, whipped, crunched, chomped, trampled.
Can you blame black people now for living in a constant state of fear, for 
 or for fighting against 
?
Remembering the violence that surrounded him when he was young, Ta-Nehisi Coates advises his son to “resist the common urge toward the comforting narrative of divine law, toward fairy tales that imply some irrepressible justice.”
America is, simply put, violent, but it is all African-Americans have. And if they want to change something, they must try to change it actively here on earth, and not allow to be passivized by stories which claim that things will change themselves for the better with time or via some divine intervention after death.
It is this, this “language of intention,” which makes everything worse.
“The point of this language of ‘intention’ and ‘personal responsibility’ is broad exoneration,” warns Coates. “Mistakes were made. Bodies were broken. People were enslaved. We meant well. We tried our best. ‘Good intention’ is a hall pass through history, a sleeping pill that ensures the Dream.”
As far as Coates is concerned, 
 is a corollary of this type of worldview. He prefers the way of 
—just like his father did in the 1970s, eventually becoming a local captain of their Party. 
Nowadays, Paul Coates works as a research librarian at Howard University, where his son, Ta-Nehisi, by his own admission, finally found himself. Dubbing Howard his Mecca, he talks of how it was there that he learned everything he now knows of race and racial divisions—or, rather, the artificiality of the notions.
“I was made for the library, not the classroom,” he writes. “The classroom was a jail of other people’s interests. The library was open, unending, free.” 
During this time, Ta-Nehisi meets Kenyatta Matthews. At 24, she becomes pregnant with his child. Nine months later the recipient of this letter is born. He is named after Samori Touré, a Guinean Muslim cleric who resisted French colonial rule in West Africa between 1882 and 1898 and died in captivity at the turn of the century.
Chapter II
A month after the birth of Samori, a classmate of Ta-Nehisi and Kenyatta from Howard, Prince Jones, is killed by the Prince George’s County police.
The officer, working undercover, had been sent out to track a 5 foot 4, 250-pound drug dealer. However, he eventually shot the 6 foot 3, 211-pound Prince Jones, just yards in front of his fiancé’s house. There were no witnesses. The charges against him were dropped for no reason whatsoever.
Coates and his wife went to Howard for their friend’s memorial. At the funeral, Ta-Nehisi couldn’t bear the atmosphere of mercy and forgiveness. After all, the police officer was incompetent and dishonest, and Prince Jones was a deeply religious and kind person. 
Why should anyone forgive the former and not rage in calls for revenge for the death of the latter?
After moving to New York in 2001, two months before September 11, Ta-Nehisi starts feeling anxious and “out of sync with the city.” The reality of this feeling becomes apparent to him on the day of the terrorist attacks.
“Everyone knew someone who knew someone who was missing,” he writes. “But looking out upon the ruins of America, my heart was cold. I had disasters all my own. The officer who killed Prince Jones, like all the officers who regard us so warily, was the sword of the American citizenry. I would never consider any American citizen pure.”
How could he?
Southern Manhattan was 
Ground Zero for the Blacks: they had not only been auctioned there but they had also been buried under those very same ruins. 
“Bin Laden was not the first man to bring terror to that section of the city,” Coates writes to his son. “I never forgot that. Neither should you.”
Even before he could be aware of it, Samori experienced how deeply engraved racism is within the fabric of American society.
For example, once he was manhandled by a white woman at a movie theatre on the Upper West Side. After Coates reprimands her, a white man intervenes. Coates experiences this as “his attempt to rescue the damsel from the beast.” The man had made no such attempt on behalf of his son. 
After being pushed by Coates, the man said to him something frightening: “I could have you arrested!” Coates thinks he knows what the sentence meant: white people are still in control, and they have all the power they need over his and other black bodies. 
Just like they always had.
That’s precisely what Coates tells Samori and his cousin during a visit of the historical sites from the Civil War when Samori is ten years old: in the eyes of the African Americans, this wasn’t a noble, heroic endeavor.
And that’s precisely what Samori can experience himself during a visit of a mother of a boy killed by the police: shouldn’t the police be protecting them?
They should—but, if you are Black, you better don’t give them a reason to change their minds:
Chapter III
The last chapter of Coates’ three-part book-length letter to Samori concerns Ta-Nehisi’s visit of Dr. Mabel Jones, the mother of the murdered Prince Jones.
Well composed, “lovely, polite, brown,” Dr. Mabel Jones was born in Louisiana, which means that she had experienced racism firsthand ever since her earliest years. However, she manages to overcome all obstacles, excelling at school, winning a scholarship to Louisiana State University, and becoming (probably) one of the first black radiologists in American history.
Noticing his intelligence early on (“he was that caliber of a student”), Mabel had hopes that Prince would go to Harvard or another Ivy League School, but chose to go to Howard instead. He just didn’t want to represent to other people anymore: he went to Howard to be normal, and “even more, to see how broad the black normal really is.”
Coates asks Mabel if she ever regretted Prince choosing Howard. “No,” she says, almost hurt. “I regret that he is dead.” Coates follows up this question with another one—if she expected that the police officer who had shot Prince would be charged. She says, “Yes.”
But he wasn’t—just like so many other police officers who have done and will do the same. Because, no matter how hard the African-Americans try to succeed, the shadow of their race hangs upon their heads like a blade.
One racist act is all it takes for a black person to lose his or her personhood. 
“There he was,” Mabel says to Coates, speaking simultaneously of Solomon Northup from 
 and her son. “He had means. He had a family. He was living like a human being. And one racist act took him back. And the same is true of me. I spent years developing a career, acquiring assets, engaging responsibilities. And one racist act. It’s all it takes.”
Coates leaves with a bitter taste in his mouth. He is devastated that modern technology has allowed the Dreamers to take control of the story behind the Dream and erase the part about how much of it is built upon black bodies.
As he is driving home, he watches through the window of his car 
 (“the same ghettos where my mother was raised, where my father was raised”), and the old fear from his childhood overwhelms his body.
Key Lessons from “Between the World and Me”
1.      The American Dream Was Built Upon Black Bodies
2.      Bin Laden Wasn’t the First Terrorist in Manhattan 
3.      The Reality of Having a Black Body
The American Dream Was Built Upon Black Bodies
The American Dream is the national ethos of the United States, what this great country was built upon. However, it is also a nightmare for a large part of America’s population, who was never even considered to be part of the population for most of the country’s history.
Ta-Nehisi Coates is adamant that the only reason why there is such a thing as American Dream is the exclusion of African-Americans from the idea: you can only build something so big and naïve on other people’s backs, and the Blacks have been forced to borrow theirs for centuries.
Bin Laden Wasn’t the First Terrorist in Manhattan 
In one of the most controversial parts of the book—questioned by none other than Michiko Kakutani—Coates says that, while America grieved over the victims of the September 11 attacks, his heart was cold, because he was very much aware that Bin Laden wasn’t the first terrorist to murder Americans in Manhattan.
Just a century ago, under the very same rubble, African-Americans were either auctioned or murdered by rich white people who are probably still as rich and as white. Manhattan was always the Ground Zero for Blacks.
The Reality of Having a Black Body
Above everything else, 
reveals that the reality of having a black body today is just a bit less bleak than the reality of having a black body a century ago. 
African-Americans are still being killed for no reason by people who are never charged, let alone imprisoned.
And, still, all it takes is just one racist act for an African-American man to lose absolutely everything he has achieved in the blink of an eye.

“The Hot Zone PDF Summary”
The first major non-fiction novel, 
, may be dealing with gory quadruple murder, but, in terms of sheer horror, it has nothing on Richard Preston’s 
,
his 1994 account of the first emergence on US soil of one of the deadliest viruses known to men: Ebola.
Its subtitle—a terrifying true story—more than suits it: enthralling, fast-paced and exceptionally well-written, the book would have been an incomparable thriller even if it hadn’t been based on factual events.
For better or for worse, it is.
And it goes something like this.
Part One: The Shadow of Mount Elgon
It’s January 1980, and a Frenchman by the name of 
 (a pseudonym) decides to visit Kitum Cave on Mount Elgon in Western Kenya, on the border with Uganda.
In case you don’t know, the Kitum Cave is one of the five “elephant caves” on Mount Elgon—all of them rich with salts, all of them frequented by these majestic creatures who go deep inside the cave to dig for salt ever since time immemorial.
Charles Monet’s decision to explore the cave, however, was a fatal mistake: a week after the visit, he starts vomiting and becomes ill with a serious fever. He is flown to Nairobi Hospital, but already on the plane he’s in such a bad state that we’ll simply decide to skip the description.
At Nairobi Hospital, he begins to hemorrhage, and gets some of his blood and vomit on his doctor, 
. Dr. Shem Musoke is unable to do anything in Monet’s case and, before too long, Monet dies.
Unfortunately, just soon after, Dr. Musoke starts showing the same symptoms. He hemorrhages badly since his blood refuses to clot and, consequently, all of his organs begin to fail, one by one. Since now it is Dr. Musoke who needs a doctor, 
steps in.
Unlike his colleague and patient, he doesn’t particularly feel like dying, so instead of working closely with his patient, he sands a sample of his blood to two labs—in South Africa and in Atlanta, Georgia. The diagnosis is devastating: the extremely dangerous Marburg virus, a Risk Group 4 pathogen of the family Filoviridae, or filoviruses.
Everything you need to know about this family of viruses, for now, is that you don’t want to mess around with any of its members. The Marburg virus may not be as deadly as its “cousins,” but it kills 1 in 4 people.
And, oh, yes, and about its cousins: the Ebola Sudan (or Sudan virus) and the Ebola Zaire virus have some of the highest mortality rates, being twice and four times scarier than the Marburg virus!
Strangely enough, Dr. Shem Musoke survives and doesn’t infect anyone else with the virus. His blood is then sent to many institutions all over the world so that the virus can be studied more closely. 
And that’s how it reaches the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), which we’ll just refer to as Institute from now on because we don’t want to be unkind toward our readers.
One of the employees at this Institute—at a Level 4 laboratory—is 
 
, who, just like her husband, 
, is
a veterinarian by trade. Nancy’s job is quite simple: she (in the presence and with the help of her superior, 
) is supposed to dissect monkeys who have died from the Ebola Zaire virus.
And the man who infects them with it?
, a man obsessed with the Ebola virus pretty much to the same extent as others are not. Needless to say, Gene is infecting monkeys with Ebola not because he is some kind of sadist, but because he wants to find a cure. And since he never has, Nancy and Tony always have something to dissect on their tables.
And this is even more difficult and stressful than dissecting a frog on your biology class: even a single contact with the virus guarantees a visit of the morgue.
Four years later, Gene Johnson receives samples of blood from another man—or, rather, a boy. This time it is a deceased 10-year-old from Denmark by the name of 
.
The tests conclusively discover the Marburg virus inside Peter’s blood. And logic discovers something else, even more interesting: since Peter too has explored Mount Elgon’s Kitum Cave, the virus must be lurking somewhere inside it. Its direct source, however, cannot be revealed despite Gene Johnson’s massive efforts.
Meanwhile, Nancy and Jerry Jaax are promoted, both of them to lieutenant colonels. In addition, Jerry becomes the head of the Institute’s veterinary division, and Jerry becomes its chief of pathology.
Parts Two & Three: The Monkey House and Smashdown
Since the second and the third part of 
both deal with the same case—the Reston epizootic—we’ve decided to group them under a single title.
In the suburb of Reston, Washington, DC, in the autumn of 1989, a company called Hazleton Research Products installs a monkey house (the Reston Primate Quarantine Unit) inside a one-story building in a small office park. 
If you don’t know what a monkey house is, it is precisely what you might guess from its name: a place that stores imported monkeys and holds them in quarantine for a month before shipping them across the US.
One day in October,
, a consulting veterinarian at the Reston Primate Quarantine Unit, noticed something strange: a large number of some newly imported monkeys start dying. By November the situation gets worse, so Dalgard contacts the Institute.
He sends some samples to two scientists, 
 and 
, who are surprised to notice, at first sight, that the cells from the samples are practically destroyed. They try to garner more information by smelling the culture, and the absence of smell suggests to them that it must be simian hemorrhagic fever—a highly pathogenic virus in monkeys, but one that is also harmless to humans.
They are, of course, wrong.
When they analyze the cells under a microscope, they discover that the cells are infected by a filovirus. Even though they fear that they have been exposed, they keep this information a secret, and relay the rest to 
 and 
.
In time, the news becomes even worse: as Jahrling discovers, the virus is either the deadliest form of filovirus (Ebola Zaire) or some unknown very close relative of this virus.
Either way, it’s time to be alarmed.
So, everybody is—including the Jaaxes, Dalgard, 
 (who oversees the USAMRIID), the local authorities, the Pentagon.
Despite everything, Dan Dalgard is relatively calm.
However, one day, an employee of his, 
, suffers a heart attack. Fearing that it might be Ebola-related, Dalgard contacts the Institute which gathers samples from Purdy and several monkey corpses. 
While Nancy is dissecting, the others (Dalgard, Johnson, C.J., General Russell) hold a meeting during which they decide it is not smart to take any more risks and agree on putting the Army in charge of euthanizing the monkeys.
The operation is conducted in secrecy so as to not alert the press or cause panic in the public. Even so, it is a dangerous one, since the monkeys in question (mostly crab-eating macaques) are not friendly toward humans and have sharp teeth. 
However, it is a necessary one, since the bodies of the monkeys dissected by Nancy are virtually destroyed, meaning the virus they are dealing with is so dangerous that euthanizing all of the monkeys is the only risk worth taking.
Case in point, an employee of the monkey house by the name of 
begins vomiting. As he is taken to the hospital, soldiers storm the monkey house and start killing the animals.
The operation, fortunately, runs smoothly, with only one of the monkeys escaping—but only briefly. Everything else goes according to plan.
Soon after, tests on Milton Frantig
discover that he is infected with the virus. The same is true in the case of Jarvis Purdy and two other Reston employees.
Three questions arise: 1) why didn’t the first tests show this; 2) how is it possible that all four men have remained virtually symptomless, one or two vomiting episodes aside; and 3) why aren’t other men infected by now?
Soon, all of these questions are answered, but in a rather strange and unexpected way, thanks to another group of infected monkeys who arrive at Reston soon after from the Philippines.
The Army decides to not intervene this time, leaving the monkeys to die out naturally.
What they discover is startling!
Namely, they weren’t infected before coming to Reston: they got infected afterward. How could that be when the Ebola Zaire virus is not airborne and can only be transmitted through contact and blood?
Well, it is because it was never the Ebola Zaire virus in the first place. It is a new, fourth strand of the virus now referred to as the Reston strand, the most dangerous of them all as far as monkeys are concerned. It is basically the Ebola Zaire virus plus the ability to transmit through air.
Fortunately, unlike the Ebola Zaire virus which kills 9 out of 10 infected people, for some unknown reason, the Reston strand doesn’t seem to affect humans.
Describing it, Preston writes:
Part Four: Kitum Cave
Three years after the events described in the first three parts, Richard Preston decides to do something no normal man would ever want to do after reading this book, and something investigative journalists can’t help but doing: visit the scenes of the crime.
Yup, Preston decides to visit both Kitum Cave and the Reston monkey house.
While traveling to Kitum, he contemplates about the emergence of another virus immensely popular and frightening at the time 
was published: HIV. According to him, it gets easier with every year for viruses to spread: one of the unexpected negative effects of globalization.
After reaching Kitum Cave, Preston is amazed at its beauty and overwhelmed by feelings incited by the fact that he has come where his story had once begun. After putting on a spacesuit, he steps inside, only to leave after a few moments, terrified that he may be infected.
“The emergence of AIDS, Ebola, and any number of other rain-forest agents appears to be a natural consequence of the ruin of the tropical biosphere,” he writes in the chilling concluding chapters, going on to say that:
With thoughts such as this in his mind, Preston travels to visit the now-abandoned monkey house at Reston. Everything is back to normal there (sort of), life springing yet again inside the facility, in all kinds of forms: plants, insects, spiders.
“Ebola had risen in these rooms, flashed its colors, fed, and subsided into the forest,” writes Preston in the last two sentences of the book. “It will be back.”
Key Lessons from “The Hot Zone”
1.      You Don’t Want to Mess with Filoviruses
2.      What the Ebola Virus Does to a Human Body
3.      Viruses, the Immune System of the Earth
You Don’t Want to Mess with Filoviruses
Filoviruses are a family of viruses named so because, under a microscope, they resemble a filament, or a short thread (
is Latin for thread).
There are a number of filoviruses, and all of them are classified as Risk Group 4 Pathogens by the World Health Organization. The four Richard Preston deals with in his book are:
• 
: Named after a city in Germany where its first major outbreak killed many people at a factory in 1967; it has a mortality rate of 25% in humans;
• 
An aggressive form of Ebola whose first known outbreak killed 181 out of 284 people in Sudan in 1976; it has a mortality rate of 50% in humans;
• 
: The most hostile form of the Ebola virus which kills 9 out of 10 people infected with it.
• 
: Discovered in Reston, USA, by accident, the Reston virus is almost the same as the Zaire Ebola virus, but though it is as lethal to monkeys, it doesn’t seem to affect humans.
What the Ebola Virus Does to a Human Body
In short, the answer to the question above is—it annihilates it. Attacking almost all types of cells, it dissolves the human tissue, practically liquifying organs and shutting down bodily functions one by one.
Since it also causes severe hemorrhages (from absolutely everywhere), many victims die due to losing too much blood. 
Interestingly enough, that may be a kind death in the case of Ebola.
Viruses, the Immune System of the Earth
The last part of 
is especially chilling since Richard Preston uses it to express his opinions about these viruses (including the then-discovered HIV) and delivers an accurate description, which, for once, isn’t anthropocentric.
What if—he asks—what if all these viruses (Ebola, HIV, etc.) are simply Earth’s immune system, its automatic response to the number of humans on Earth? What if, in some way or another, in the grand scheme of things, we’ve become unbearable to it? What if finding a cure for 
 is not what we’re supposed to be looking for?

“Holy Envy PDF Summary”
In the Gospel of Matthew (22:35-40), as is—or, at least, should be—known to every Christian, upon hearing him talk, a lawyer comes near Jesus and asks him a simple question: “Master, which is the great commandment in the law?”
Jesus responds: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments,” Jesus concludes, “hang all the law and the prophets.”
Most Christian denominations agree: they consider these two commandments to “contain the whole law of God” and to be the benchmarks of a proper Christian life on earth. After all, Jesus himself calls these the greatest commandments. And it helps that they can be found, expressed in one way or another, in all the other three Gospels as well (Mark 12:28-31, Luke 10:25-28, John 13:31-35).
However, in reality, it seems that things don’t work that way: the more a Christian loves his god, the less he/she seems to love his/her neighbor.
You don’t agree?
Really?
Think again: Muslims, Jews, Buddhists—they are all your neighbors. How much do you actually love them? And how much are you merely interested in converting them, believing, deep down inside, that your path is the only reasonable path since it has been sanctioned by God and Jesus. 
Well, Barbara Brown Taylor, an American Episcopal priest and Piedmont College professor of religion and philosophy, would want to kindly ask you to reconsider your position and leave room for something she refers to as “holy envy.”
Interested?
What Is Holy Envy?
To understand what is “holy envy,” we must go back a few decades and meet “a tall, Scandinavian man with a stiff neck and a head of wavy hair” named Krister Stendhal. A respected scholar of the apostle Paul, Stendhal was also the dean of Harvard Divinity School and the Bishop of Stockholm.
Just a year after he was elected for the position, he faced a serious problem: vocal opposition from numerous people (mostly Christians) to the building of a new Mormon temple in Stockholm.
Not a very Christian thing to do, don’t you think?
So, at a press conference prior to the dedication of the temple, Stendhal proposed three rules of religious understanding that, in the words of Barbara Brown Taylor, “have by now made the rounds more often than any of his scholarly work on the apostle Paul.”
The three rules in question are the following ones:
#1. When trying to understand another religion, you should ask the adherents of that religion and not its enemies;
#2. Don’t compare your best to their worst;
#3. Leave room for holy envy.
Nobody really knows what Stendhal meant by #3, informs us Taylor, but you can guess the meaning of this rule by some of his subsequent actions. Namely, in one or two later discussions, he expressed his “holy envy” for the best-known doctrine of the Latter-Day Saint movement: “vicarious baptism” or “baptism for the dead.”
It was this “holy envy” which gave Stendhal some “holy courage”: though a Lutheran, he stood by the Mormons—a religious minority in Sweden—to the very end, fearless of how this may affect his status and position. “In the eyes of God, we are all minorities,” he told a reporter shortly before his death in 2008.
“Plain Old Envy” vs. “Holy Envy”
“The first time I heard the phrase ‘holy envy,’” writes Taylor after relaying the story above, “I knew it was an improvement over the plain old envy I felt while studying other faiths.” 
What does she mean by that?
Well, with “holy envy,” it is a bit different. Because it is not anymore about what your religion
—but about what God surely 
. Since God is benevolent and the embodiment of all good things that have ever existed, it is only natural to expect that he is also everything other religions have (and is 
), and yours lacks (which is bad in itself).
But this leads us to another versus-section which should make things as clear as day.
Religion vs. God
To understand “holy envy,” you first need to understand that there is a difference between Christianity and Jesus—or, in more general terms, between religion and God. 
A simple analogy may help you to see this difference. 
Think of a well filled with so much water inside that many people can dip buckets in it and take with them as much water as they like. Still, you’d have to agree that neither the well nor the buckets are actually the water. 
Because no matter how much water there is in the well, there are also rivers and seas and oceans, and rain and snow and ice. None of them are the water; they are all just different aspects of it. The bucket, the well, the oceans—they are all just containers; none of them is the source.
The same applies to this Christianity/Jesus or, more generally, religion/God relationship: Jesus and God are so much more than their containers, even if they are called the New Testament or the Bible. “The problem with every sacred text,” writes Taylor, “is that it has human readers. Consciously or unconsciously, we interpret it to meet our own needs.” 
Of course, there’s nothing wrong with this if we admit it. The problems arise when we deny it. And, more often than not, we do precisely that! We don’t think that we’re interpreting the Bible, but that we’re merely reporting what it 
 says.
This is wrong on at least three accounts:
#1. Unless you know both Hebrew and Greek and have a relevant error-free copy of the Bible, you’re reading a translation, brought to you by certain translators, i.e., other human beings prone to making mistakes;
#2. Claiming that you are merely reporting and not interpreting means that the language you understand (be it English or French or Portuguese) is so perfect that it can relay God’s messages as they are.
#3. Moreover, it means that you are able to understand God’s words as perfectly clear as He does.
“It is such a short distance between believing you possess an error-free message from God and believing that you are an error-free messenger of God,” writes Taylor. And we don’t need to tell you that the ones who believe to be error-free messengers of God are the very ones who are ready to commit crimes in His Name. 
Taylor concludes:
Learning from Other Religions
To put it simply, all religions are mere buckets which we lower under ground to take some living water so that we can start investigating and understanding it. God, however, is the entirety of the living water and cannot be understood completely. The ones who say they understand Him are just as sinful as Lucifer: too proud to know their own limitations.
If our religion is merely the lens through which we see God, it is very wrong to forbid other people to use their own lenses when they are doing pretty much the same thing. “The lens is not the landscape,” writes Taylor. “It is a way of translating the landscape so that people can walk upright on it, making some sense of what happens to them.”
It is not strange that different religions have made sense of God and the world in different manners; it is strange to think that your way is the only valid one. 
Think of the story of Rabia of Basra, an eighth-century Sufi who was seen running one day through the streets of her native city, with a bucket of water in one hand and a torch in the other. When asked about it, Rabia replied that she wanted to put out the fires of hell with the water and burn down the reward of paradise with the torch.
“O, Allah,” she prayed, “if I worship You for fear of Hell, burn me in Hell, and if I worship You in the hope of Paradise, exclude me from Paradise. But if I worship You for Your Own sake, grudge me not Your everlasting Beauty.”
What’s wrong with that story? asks Taylor. Isn’t it a great illustration of unconditional love for God? So, what if its protagonist is a Muslim mystic from Iraq! Everyone who loves God can learn more about how to unconditionally surrender to himself via this story.
Throughout 
, Taylor recounts many stories of this kind which have helped her broaden her perspectives. Perhaps the most memorable one happened to her at the end of a field trip to the Atlanta Masjid of Al-Islam, when the imam ended his meeting with these words of wisdom: “Our deepest desire is not that you become Muslim, but that you become the best Christian, the best Jew, the best person you can be. In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Thank you for coming.” 
Now there’s something to be envious about—in a strictly holy kind of way.
Jesus and the Religious Strangers in 
Life
Jesus’ two great commandments make a lot of sense even if you have just a vague understanding of his philosophy. For one, he didn’t just help people who were like him—he helped everyone. And, interestingly enough, he was also 
 by these strangers.
Just think of that Canaanite woman in Matthew 15:21-28. Jesus told her that he was “sent only to the lost sheep of Israel,” but on account of her faith, he “expanded his sense of agency” and granted her request to exorcise her daughter.
Or think of that Roman centurion (Matthew 8:5-13), about whom Jesus himself says that he had “not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.” And he was a pagan. What should these words mean if not embracing religious pluralism?
Finally, think of the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-29), or, even more, of that other Samaritan (Luke 17:11-19), the only one of the ten lepers who returned to show his gratitude to Jesus after being cured by Him, even though a foreigner.
“No preacher has suggested to the students of today that today’s Good Samaritan might be a Good Muslim or a Good Humanist,” writes Taylor. “No confirmation class teacher has taught them that the Golden Rule includes honoring the neighbor’s religion as they would have the neighbor honor theirs.”
Key Lessons from “Holy Envy”
1.      Stendhal’s Three Rules of Religious Understanding
2.      If Proper, Religious Envy Can Make You Holier
3.      The Bible Is Not God, and You Are Not the Bible
Stendhal’s Three Rules of Religious Understanding
According to Swedish theologian and scholar Krister Stendhal, if you really want to be a good person, you need to accept and understand other religions. And if you want to do that, you need to follow three rules:
#1. Learn about this other religion from its devotees, and not its enemies;
#2. Don’t compare your best to their worst; and
#3. Practice holy envy.
If Proper, Religious Envy Can Make You Holier
Even though nobody knows what precisely Stendhal means by “practice holy envy,” Barbara Brown Taylor has a pretty good idea.
It means that some practices in other religious traditions may be better than the ones in your own, and you should be willing to recognize this fact, not merely as an aspect of faith, but also as an aspect of the All-Good God.
What’s wrong with the Muslims praying five times a day no matter what? Or with Buddhist meditation? Or with Judaism not embracing the doctrine of the original sin?
It’s good to envy these things; because this envy may help you understand that these other religious traditions, just like yours, are ways to come close to God. Something which we share—and not something which should divide us.
The Bible Is Not God, and You Are Not the Bible
The reason why religious people don’t seem to understand each other is because all of them think that their book (and not the book of their neighbors) represents the Word of God. Maybe all of them are right, says Taylor.
The problem is that the language of these books is a human language, and human languages are prone to create misunderstandings. What we read in the Bible is not God’s words, but an interpretation of them. And, consequently, what we know about God is not God, but merely an aspect of His.
Only by embracing pluralism, we should be able to understand Him better.

Oprah believes that every one of us is born with a purpose.
And she’s adamant about helping you step into 
 God-given calling!
Who Should Read “The Path Made Clear”? And Why?
If you are one of the billions of people googling questions such as “what is my purpose?” or “what is the meaning of life?” — then this book will probably interest you.
Also, if you know and like Oprah and you feel that you can never have enough of her, then, really, is there any need for a recommendation?
About Oprah Winfrey
 is an American talk show host, actress, and media executive, best known for 
, the highest-rated TV program of its kind in history.
Born and raised in poverty, Oprah became a co-anchor for the evening news already in her teenage years, after which she transferred to Chicago to become the host of 
. In just a few months, she made it the highest-rated talk show in the state and, as they say, the rest is history.
In addition to being one of the most famous women in the world, Oprah is also an Academy Award nominee for her role in 
, and one of the most generous philanthropists alive.

“The Path Made Clear PDF Summary”
If you type in the question “What is my purpose?” in the Google search query and then press “Enter,” you’ll get 2 
 responses!
(Oprah says “one billion,” but we did the experiment, and it’s actually twice as that!)
That means only one thing: it is in the nature of humans to ask themselves what they are doing on this planet, and it is not at all surprising that we all long for an existence that matters.
“On the surface, typing those four little words … 
 and pressing Enter may seem trivial,” writes Oprah, “but it’s really a profound reflection of an intimate prayer rising from the deepest part of the heart. It’s asking to be acknowledged. Initiating that search is a sign that the journey toward an elevated life filled with meaning and character is ready to begin.”
The 
 news?
Your purpose is not something you need to look outside your own self. Because it is unique to your own existence: we are 
 born with a God-given calling. All you have to do is follow your path to answer this call.
Oprah’s hope with 
 is “to offer the wisdom of experience from the visionaries, artists, teachers, and trailblazers who have walked this road before you, and who have shared their inspiration and lessons with [her].”
The common thread among them: “They have discovered that in this world, there is no real 
 without first 
.”
The Seeds
If you’ve read your 
, you probably remember “The Parable of the Mustard Seed.” It appears in all Gospels except that of John, but we’ll quote it from Matthew (13:31-32):
“The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.”
Oprah says that this was one of her favorite Bible parables.
Why?
Because it suggested that no matter how small or insignificant you are, anything is possible. “As a child,” she writes, “listening from my seat in church, this brought me so much comfort—just as it did when I was struggling as a reporter in Baltimore and as it still does today.”
The mustard seed is so small and, yet, in time, it grows into something so big and significant. The only thing you need to do is discover it, and let it grow inside you.
Our lives are not static, she says: “every decision, setback, or triumph is an opportunity to identify the seeds of truth that make you the wondrous human being that you are.”
She herself had an experience such as this.
As you know, she worked as a news anchor for several years in the early 1970s, and, then, in 1978 she was demoted to become a co-host of the talk show 
It was then that she discovered her seed.
You can do it too: just pay attention to what feeds your energy. “Trust that the Universe has a bigger, wider, deeper dream for you than you could ever imagine for yourself,” concludes Oprah.
The Roots
Oprah doesn’t believe in coincidences: she believes that there is a divine order to the magnificent mystery of our lives.
And one of the things she enjoys most is watching someone experience an 
. 
In her mind, this 
moment is proof that there’s something deeply rooted within us, and that to experience the true joy you must tap into it. It’s like a puzzle: sometimes the pieces just click, and you know that everything’s going to be alright.
“Whatever your calling,” Oprah writes, “it’s already rooted within you, and those roots can be trampled or tugged at but never removed. They grow stronger only when tended, nurtured—and, most important, shared with others.”
Oprah’s deepest desire is to help people 
 in the literal meaning of these words. The world would be much more beautiful, she thinks, if everybody does what he/she is born to do.
When you align your personality with your purpose—
—no one can touch you.
The Whispers
“Passion whispers to you through your feelings, beckoning you toward your highest good,” writes Oprah at the beginning of this third chapter, quoting, well, herself (after all, she 
 Oprah, and she 
 do that!)
She experienced this herself when she was demoted.
Many people would look at an event such as that as some kind of failure and do their best to get back where they had been before the demotion.
Not Oprah: she just remembered to relax and see if this was some kind of a sign. The very first interview she had confirmed her initial suspicions: the demotion was a blessing in disguise.
“Your life is always speaking to you,” says Oprah, noting that this is one of her most cherished spiritual principles, one that she has taken every opportunity to share with the world.
Life speaks in whispers, she goes on, and these whispers are your guides to your next right step. They can take many forms: a shiver, a goose-bump, a pit in the stomach, a pause before you speak. And they can be positive, saying things such as “I should do this. I 
 ought to do this in life,” or negative whispering sentences like “Hmm, something feels off” or “This is no longer your place of belonging.”
“Whatever form the whisper takes, it’s not a coincidence. Your life is trying to tell you something,” writes Oprah. “Heeding these signs can open the doors to your personal evolution, pushing you toward your life’s purpose. Ignoring them—sleepwalking through your life—is an invitation to chaos.”
The Clouds
When in 2013, Oprah Winfrey was invited to give a 
 at Harvard’s 362nd Commencement on May 30, 2013, at Tercentenary Theatre, for the first time in her long and successful career, she felt the fear of public speaking.
“I felt 
 of pressure,” she writes, “the kind of internal angst that makes you sit down at the computer to write, take one look at the empty screen, close the computer, and say, 
. Then worry about it more, set a deadline to work on it again, and, when the alarm goes off, find an excuse not to do it. You know how that goes.”
Oprah’s usual mantras in situations such as this are “When you don’t know what to do, do nothing and the answer will come” and “doubt means 
”
However, no answer came even after a few weeks, and Oprah was more and more sure that it wasn’t doubt that crippled her: it was fear—fear that she had nothing new to tell to these brilliant Harvard minds.
And then came her revelation!
“The more important an activity is to your soul’s evolution,” said to her author Steven Pressfield during a conversation, “
.”
In other words, fear and doubt stem not merely from the devilish voices inside you: they are sometimes resistance embodied. And resistance is the cloud that accompanies every dream.
To lift this cloud, turn your will and your desire into allies. “You get to decide. You get to declare, 
 and confront the fear head-on,” writes Oprah.
The Map
“When you want something,” 
,
all the Universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”
Oprah is a firm believer in this aphorism.
However, she also feels the need to highlight that 
: “the variable between winning the race and faltering at the finish line,” she writes, “lies with one of the guiding forces in my life: intention.”
In other words, the Universe 
help you, but you have to be clear in your vision so as to not let it nudge you in the wrong direction.
You’re not going to a new place without studying the map beforehand, right? Why should living and achieving your goals be any different?
And committing to your course starts with a simple question: “Why?” Why are you doing this? What is your real intention? 
Only then, you can move to the next question: “How will I execute the action?”
Leave the rest to the Universe.
The Road
Feminist icon Gloria Steinem is one of the people Oprah believes are the truest expression of themselves.
Once, Gloria told Oprah her secret: she moved through life with such “razor-sharp clarity” because her mind is in a constant “on the road” state.
This way of thinking, she said to Winfrey, reminds her to stay open to learning at all times, because travel “brings people out of their heads and into their hearts” and offers the promise of expanding the truth. 
The “on the road” philosophy makes you feel “boundaryless, spontaneous, and at one with everything”—just like traveling when it’s done properly.
Gloria compares this “on the road” thinking mode to “a bird in flight, riding on a current, perpetually focused on forward motion, at all times checking the direction of the wind, yet open to all possibilities.”
Somehow, birds let things go and still make things happen; and so do human beings when they adapt to this “on the road” philosophy of life.
That’s why, for Oprah, this philosophy is practically synonymous with the word Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi introduced a while ago: 
. Or, even better, it is synonymous with a phrase athletes have been using for decades: “in the zone.”
To describe it, they use phrases such as “tunnel vision,” “complete calm,” or “ultra-focus.” “Some liken it to a spiritual experience,” says Oprah, “a state of consciousness in which time feels like it has slowed down or completely fallen away.”
When you’re in the zone, the road is clear in front of you, open, smooth and yours for the taking. 
And as LeBron James himself told Oprah once, to be in the zone, all you need to do is stop playing for the others and start playing for yourself.
The Climb
“I have always thought a mountain is a magnificent metaphor for life,” writes Oprah. “From a distance, the ascent looks clear and smooth, but once you actually set out for the summit, you discover unexpected valleys and precarious ridges along the way. If your internal compass isn’t set to keep climbing, every stumble will give you an excuse to turn back.”
But you are not allowed excuses if your goal is to climb the mountain. Even when it is a steep and rocky road ahead of you, you must go forward—and, thus, upward.
Stumbles are an inevitable part of any road, but they are also, sometimes, what makes the road worthwhile.
One of Oprah’s favorite lessons coming from pastor 
 is “What follows ‘I am’ is what we’re inviting into our life.”
In other words, if you say things such as “I am exhausted” or “I am overwhelmed” that’s inevitably what you’ll become because 
.
Oprah felt this herself a few years back when she started building her OWN network (the Oprah Winfrey Network). 
When she shifted her perspective from “I am struggling” to “I am honored,” suddenly everything changed: her climb was transformed “from an arduous trek into a still challenging but now stimulating adventure.”
Since then, she looks at both stumbles and failures as teachers—not as setbacks.
The Give
Oprah Winfrey considers Maya Angelou her “spiritual queen mother” and her “ultimate teacher.”
Once the great poetess told her: “People may not remember what you did or what you said, but they always remember how you made them feel.”
This thought has resonated with Oprah ever since: it was the first time she realized that every single moment we have here on earth is an opportunity to be of service to other people.
“When you know, teach,” said Maya Angelou. “and when you get, give.”
Has something truer and more humane ever been said?
The Reward
We haven’t gotten to summarizing it yet, but 
 by Sarah Ban Breathnach was all the rage a decade ago.
The book—a collection of evocative essays, one for each day of the year—has sold seven million copies to this day and has been translated into more than 30 languages.
What fascinates even more, it was Sarah Breathnach’s debut!
You can imagine how much her life changed after 
: she became a multimillionaire practically overnight.
The problem with that: she didn’t really know what to do with the money!
She hired nine assistants, bought eight pairs of Manolo Blahnik shoes in one trip, and even bought a chapel actually owned by Sir Isaac Newton once!
Fifteen years later, there she was—talking to Oprah about losing it all.
“What I learned from Sarah and so many others,” comments Oprah, “is that the way people handle money reflects the way they see themselves. Many times when people win the lottery and experience a windfall, they don’t see themselves as worthy of their newfound riches. They wind up spending on possessions to create an idea of self-worth. When you’ve become blinded by the status symbols, it’s easy to lose sight of the unique gifts only you can offer the world.”
Oprah is not like that: she knows she isn’t the salary she receives. Because she also knows that everything passes and changes with time.
Everything, that is, but you—who you are, what you are, and what you are meant to share with the world.
“That is your true treasure,” she concludes.
Home
Have you watched 
?
Of course, you have: who hasn’t!
Oprah thinks that the film (as well as the book, of course) is “one of the great spiritual teachings of all time.”
Why?
Because it illustrates perfectly the universal human coordinates of something, Joseph Campbell dubbed “
”: the Yellow Brick Road represented nothing but Dorothy’s path toward her true self.
Just like many of us, Dorothy started her journey believing that she needs something outside herself to bestow the cherished virtues on her friends (a brain for Scarecrow, a heart for the Tin Man, and courage for the Cowardly Lion) and reach home.
Of course, the truth is that all of her friends were “the disempowered parts of 
,” and that the goal of her journey wasn’t a place on the map, but a higher level of consciousness about her own existence.
That is why Oprah says, the most powerful scene in the film is when Glinda the Good Witch says “the words that spiritual teachers have been trying to convey for thousands of years:”
“You don’t need to be helped any longer. You’ve always had the power.”
“Then why didn’t you tell her before?” asks the Scarecrow.
“Because she wouldn’t have believed me. She had to learn it for herself,” answers Glinda.
This was the greatest 
moment of Oprah’s life: there is always a path home because you are always you.
That’s the essence of Dorothy’s words at the end:
“If I ever go looking for my heart’s desire again, I won’t look any further than my own backyard. Because if it isn’t there, I never really lost it, to begin with.”
“You already know,” says Oprah in the epigraph.
And, trust us, you do.
Key Lessons from “The Path Made Clear”
1.      Your Purpose Is Rooted Within You
2.      Listen to the Whispers and Climb the Mountain
3.      The Goal of the Journey Is Not a Place, But a State of Mind
Your Purpose Is Rooted Within You
Whatever your calling, Oprah says, it is already rooted within you, in the way Buck’s calling to become something more of a dog was rooted within him even when he was the most obedient and loyal sled dog in Thornton’s camp.
Meaning: no matter how much you’ve strayed from your purpose, it will always be there inside you, waiting to be discovered and grasped.
Your purpose grows stronger when tended and shared with other people—so start doing that right now.
Listen to the Whispers and Climb the Mountain
Don’t really know your purpose?
Don’t worry!
Life is whispering it to you all the time!
It may be the goosebumps, the fire in your eyes or your belly, or, simply, the gut feeling that something’s off. Be they positive or negative, these are all 
, body signals which nudge you in the right direction, toward the top of the mountain.
Because that’s what life is: climbing a mountain and overcoming all obstacles. Not using the latter as excuses. 
The Goal of the Journey Is Not a Place, But a State of Mind
This is the essence of most spiritual teachings ever devised: what you want the most, you already have within you.
You just need to discover it.
Material gains, fame, property—all of these things are just surrogates, substitutes about 
. And to discover that something else, you need nothing but attention and awareness.
The holy mountain isn’t located in the distance: it is buried deep inside your heart.s

As Philomena Cunk so eloquently put it once: “
”
Carlo Rovelli is here to explain that—and so much more.
So that you can finally see:
Who Should Read “The Order of Time”? And Why?
You think you know what time is? Chances are: you don’t. For a simple reason: nobody really does. Even physicists. 
This one, however—the exceptional Carlo Rovelli—is so great in communicating this lack of knowledge that you’ll feel so much richer by the end of this fairly short, but infinitely rich and poetic book.
Read 
 if you’re curious about how time works, and, moreover, about how scientists think. 
About Carlo Rovelli
 is an Italian theoretical physicist, founder of loop quantum gravity theory, and one of 
’s 100 most influential global thinkers.
A regular collaborator with several Italian newspapers, Rovelli is one of the great popularizers of science, dubbed “the new Stephen Hawking” by

“The Order of Time PDF Summary”
“Reality is often very different from what it seems,” writes Carlo Rovelli in the “Introduction” to 
, aptly dubbed “Perhaps Time Is the Greatest Mystery.”
“The Earth,” he goes on, “appears to be flat but is in fact spherical. The sun seems to revolve in the sky when it is really 
 who are spinning.”
Analogously, even though time appears to be a uniform, universal flowing, it is anything but: we don’t inhabit it as fish swimming in the water (the water being the time in this metaphor), and it doesn’t drag the universe into the future from the past.
“Time works quite differently from the way it seems to,” says Rovelli, and he wastes no time to completely and utterly blow our minds what lies behind that sentence.
Let’s go over the highlights.
Part I THE CRUMBLING OF TIME
In the first—and perhaps most interesting—part (especially for novices) of 
, Carlo Rovelli summarizes what modern physics knows about time. 
“It is like holding a snowflake in your hands,” he poetically notes, “gradually, as you study it, it melts between your fingers and vanishes”: 
Hence the title of this part: as we discovered more and more about time, it slowly disintegrated to mean something pretty much counter-intuitive: a complex collection of structures and layers which is neither unified nor independent, and which has neither a direction nor definite value.
Let’s start with perhaps the most fundamental aspect of time: it, we believe, passes everywhere at the very same speed.
This is, however, completely wrong: even if you place a clock on the table and compare it, after a few years, with one sitting at the floor, the two will differ. True, the differences would be minuscule, but it is measurable and exists: the clock on the table would always tick faster. 
This, of course, suggests something even bigger.
Namely, what if you are a twin who separates from his brother/sister to live on the mountain, leaving your sibling on the seashore?
Believe it or not, time would move faster for you, and you’ll live longer than your sibling in absolute terms. It is a scientific fact: “time passes faster in the mountains than it does at sea level.”
And it is also one of the things Einstein discovered a century ago: gravity is just a side-effect of large bodies modifying the structure of space-time between them.
Because of this modification, Earth slows down the flow of time, but it does so at different rates: the plains are closer to it, so there time slows more than it does so in the mountains.
“If things fall, it is due to this slowing down of time,” writes Rovelli. “Where time passes uniformly, in interplanetary space, things do not fall. They float, without falling. Here on the surface of our planet, on the other hand, the movement of things inclines naturally toward where time passes more slowly, as when we run down the beach into the sea, and the resistance of the water on our legs makes us fall headfirst into the waves. Things fall downward because, down there, time is slowed by the Earth.”
Fascinating?
Wait till you hear the rest!
Another fundamental time-related thing we experience as pretty much a given is its parts: past, present, future. 
“Past and future are different from each other,” explains Rovelli. “Cause precedes effect. Pain comes after a wound, not before it. The glass shatters into a thousand pieces, and the pieces do not re-form into a glass. We cannot change the past; we can have regrets, remorse, memories. The future instead is uncertainty, desire, anxiety, open space, destiny, perhaps. We can live toward it, shape it, because it does not yet exist. Everything is still possible… Time is not a line with two equal directions: it is an arrow with different extremities.”
Strangely enough, this 
isn’t true: “The difference between past and future, between cause and effect, between memory and hope, between regret and intention… in the elementary laws that describe the mechanisms of the world, there is no such difference.”
Believe it or not, the 
 law which distinguishes the past from the future is the Second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of a system can never decrease over time.
In plainer words, if nothing else changes, heat cannot pass from a cold body to a hot one.
In essence, this means that time is fundamentally interrelated with heat: “every time a difference is manifested between the past and the future, heat is involved. In every sequence of events that becomes absurd if projected backward, there is something that is heating up.”
Even when you’re thinking: thinking produces heat in your head, and that is the only reason why your thoughts move from the past to the future.
Now that we’re done with the past and the future, let’s strip time of yet another of its intuitively graspable levels: the present.
Believe it or not, the word “now” means nothing beyond your approximate surroundings: in universal terms, now is a non-existent concept.
Think of it this way: when you’re watching the sunset, the Sun is already set—because it takes its light approximately 8 minutes and 19 seconds to reach our planet, that’s precisely how far back into the past of the sun you’re seeing at your apparent “now.”
Put more plainly, the “now” of the Sun and your “now” are two different moments of time: it’s almost as if you and it are existing in two parallel worlds.
What if that actually happens?
What if your sister decides to leave this planet and start a life on the planet Proxima B, located about four light years away from the Earth?
What would you see through the telescope at any given moment?
Well, your sister from 4 years ago!
And this is where it gets even stranger: if, during this time she manages to discover some spaceship flying at a speed faster than the speed of light, you might be, in theory, able to both see her on Proxima B, and right around the corner of your street!
“It simply makes no sense to ask which moment in the life of your sister on Proxima B corresponds to now,” writes Rovelli. “It is like asking which football team has won a basketball championship, how much money a swallow has earned, or how much a musical note weighs.”
“There is no special moment on Proxima b that corresponds to what constitutes the present here and now,” he concludes.
Cue: Twilight Zone theme music.
The reason why time works so counter-intuitively is rather simple: it is 
 independent; it is directly related to something we are able to understand a bit better, i.e., space.
Time and space—after Einstein referred to, almost always and correctly, as “the time-space continuum”—are two sides of the same coin and they, quite materially, form 
.
When an object of massive size (such as the Earth) warps the time-space continuum, the result is gravity and a specific “flow of time” at that specific place, depending, of course, on the size of the denture. Black holes, for example, bend the time-space continuum so much that, 
, time stops completely.
We managed to understand more about this via something Einstein didn’t believe in that much: quantum physics.
It led us to three fundamental discoveries: granularity, indeterminacy, and the relational aspect of physical variables.
is the most characteristic feature of quantum mechanics. It means that a minimum scale exists for all phenomena, including time. The smallest unit of time is called Planck time and it amounts to 10
 seconds: a hundred millionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second. At such a minute scale, the notion of time is no longer valid.
means
that “it is not possible to predict exactly, for instance, where an electron will appear tomorrow. Between one appearance and another, the electron has no precise position, as if it were dispersed in a cloud of probability.
In addition, an electron is concrete 
the other physical objects it is interacting with. In other words, 
 happens only in relation to a physical system.
“Time has loosened into a network of relations that no longer holds together as a coherent canvas,” concludes Rovelli. 
The actual picture on the canvas is this: “spacetimes (in the plural) fluctuating, superimposed one above the other, materializing at certain times with respect to particular objects.”
Part II THE WORLD WITHOUT TIME
In the second part of 
, Rovelli describes what we are left with once we’ve stripped time off all of its layers: “an empty, windswept landscape almost devoid of all trace of temporality.” And yet, this is precisely our world.
So, let’s see how that world actually looks like.
One of the strangest consequences of this line of thinking is this: nothing ever 
, everything, ultimately and merely, just 
. 
Because if time doesn’t exist the way we believe it does, 
don’t exist either: every single thing you see around you is merely just a more durable event.
At first sight, there’s a big difference between a stone and a kiss: the first is the prototypal thing, the letter an embodiment of an event. 
We will never ask ourselves 
the kiss will be tomorrow, but we can ask ourselves 
 the stone will be in twelve days. On the other hand, it is a pretty sound question to ask someone 
did he/she have his/her first kiss.
However, as we found out above, time and space work together, And on closer inspection, we realize that even the most “thinglike” things such as stones are nothing but long events.
“The hardest stone,” writes Rovelli, “in the light of what we have learned from chemistry, from physics, from mineralogy, from geology, from psychology, is in reality a complex vibration of quantum fields, a momentary interaction of forces, a process that for a brief moment manages to keep its shape, to hold itself in equilibrium before disintegrating again into dust.”
“Thinking of the world as a collection of events, of processes,” he goes on, “is the way that allows us to better grasp, comprehend, and describe it. It is the only way that is compatible with relativity. The world is not a collection of things, it is a collection of events.”
Unfortunately, our grammar is inadequate to grasp this. 
It is strange to think, but that quote which introduces the popular Netflix German TV show called 
by Einstein isn’t a metaphor, but a physical fact:
“People like us who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.”
This sentence is taken from a letter by Einstein to the son and sister of Michele Besso sent near the end of his life. And it’s one which makes the distinction between 
 and 
In 
, we know precisely what “now” means because we believe in an objective global present. Yet, as physics discovered, the present is relative to the observer, i.e., what is real for one is not actually real for someone else.
That’s where 
 comes: the idea that flow and change are illusory and that the past, present, and the future are all equally real and existent.
This is closer to the truth than you can imagine, but it is also not the truth. 
The truth is that there is 
order of time, i.e., the temporal structure of the world is not that of 
. But the changes mentioned in Einstein’s quote are not illusory, but real. The thing is they do not follow a global order.
Einstein’s letter was sent to console a grieving sister, and it is only because of the inadequacy of grammar and our metaphor-laden language that we confuse things.
It is also because of this that we are unable to understand—or even speak about—certain natural phenomena.
Part III THE SOURCES OF TIME
“The third part of the book,” writes Rovelli, “is the most difficult, but also the most vital and the one that most closely involves us. In a world without time, there must still be something that gives rise to the time that we are accustomed to, with its order, with its past that is different from the future, with its smooth flowing. Somehow, our time must emerge around us, at least for us and at our scale.”
So let’s see how and why we 
time in a timeless universe.
Imagine a group of children deciding between themselves the two opposing sides in a football game by, say, tossing a coin.
Of course, after some time there are two teams on the field pitted against each other.
The thought-provoking question?
Where were the teams 
the coin toss?
Nowhere. Simply put, they didn’t exist: they are the result of the coin toss. They are an “emergent phenomenon.”
Well, you should think of time as something like that: it is not an objective fact, it is not something that exists out there. It is something that 
due to our particular perspective of the universe, granted by a set of circumstances and our subjective vision.
“The entire difference between past and future,” writes Carlo Rovelli, “may be attributed solely to the fact that the entropy of the world was low in the past.”
As we saw above, in time, entropy always increases; if it was the other way around, we would have lived in a world not that unlike a rewound movie: pieces of shattered glass would form a bottle and the smoke—cigarettes.
So, in other words, if there’s no entropy—i.e., if nothing changes—there is no time as well. And, in a way, it is entropy, not energy, that drives the world.
Think of it this way: if entropy always increases, then only where it is tightly packed in orderly pieces of matter, there could be such things as history and evolution.
Fortunately, we live inside a universe where this is the case: we don’t know precisely why (Rovelli has a theory), but, for some reason, we are that place of the universe where the second law of thermodynamics works to our benefit.
How and why?
Well, it all starts with the sun, a rich source of low entropy which is usable because it is located very close to our planet.
The sun radiates a hot photon (light particles) toward Earth, and the Earth harks back by emitting ten colder photons which have less energy and, thus, balance things out.
A hot photon, however, has much less entropy than ten colder photons (as we said above, heat always moves to cold, not the other way around).
This way, the Earth can use the Sun’s energy to power its processes and make things move around. This, of course, results in low entropy transforming in high entropy, such as the ones occurring in your body which, ultimately, will lead to a state of lowest entropy called death.
“The existence of common causes in the past is nothing but a manifestation of low entropy in the past,” writes Rovelli. “In a state of thermal equilibrium, or in a purely mechanical system, there isn’t a direction to time identified by causality.”
“We are processes, events, composite and limited in space and time,” concludes Rovelli. 
“But if we are not an individual entity,” he goes on, “what is it that founds our identity and its unity? What makes it so—that I am Carlo—and that my hair and my nails and my feet are considered part of me, as well as my anger and my dreams, and that I consider myself to be the same Carlo as yesterday, the same as tomorrow; the one who thinks, suffers, and perceives?”
Many different ingredients, he says, but three are of the utmost importance: point of view, organization by grouping and segmenting, and memory.
is self-explanatory: “The world is reflected in each one of us through a rich spectrum of correlations essential for our survival. Each of us is a complex process that reflects the world and elaborates the information we receive in a way that is 
 integrated.”
The second ingredient (organization) suggests this: we tend to group and segment things into entities so that we can better grasp them. That’s why we call a certain collection of rocks and fields “Mount Everest” and a certain collection of atoms that change “Jack” or “Jill.”
Finally, the third ingredient which comprises our identity is 
, perhaps the most essential one as far as time is concerned. Because it is memory which catalogizes things in our brains in a narrative manner, making strict distinctions between past and future events.
That is why people who have memory problems can’t organize the world in such a neat manner and confuse between the past and the present. That is why they no longer seem as unified beings—but as someone different from them.
Memory is a guarantee of identity.
Key Lessons from “The Order of Time”
1.      The Faster You Are, the Slower Time Moves 
2.      The Past and the Future Exist Because of Heat
3.      Our Universe Is a Special Case—And That’s Why Time Looks the Way It Does
The Faster You Are, the Slower Time Moves 
It may seem like some sort of a glitch taken straight out of SF-novels, but, as Carlo Rovelli says, “this is how reality works.”
In other words, whether you like it or not, we know for a fact (
) that the faster you move, the slower time moves for you, resulting in a singular paradox.
Namely, a twin who travels at speed near the speed of light and goes to another planet, after returning, would be much younger than his brother.
Don’t believe us?
In 1971, two Americans (a physicist and an astronomer) 
, sending four cesium atomic clocks in different directions around the planet to see if they’ll gain nanoseconds when compared to the clocks at the US Naval Observatory.
They did—
 as much as Einstein predicted.
The Past and the Future Exist Because of Heat
Interestingly enough, even though it is highly intuitive that time is what separates the past from the future, the only law which suggests that there is some kind of a distinction between the past and the future is the law of entropy, the irreversible progress of heat.
Leave a hot cup of tea, and it will inevitably grow cold in time; it will never get hot again by itself.
The same is true with time: it travels only in one direction, but merely because we see some things as irretrievably changed when going forward.
And we can see this only in the irreversible progress of heat.
Mind-blowing and counter-intuitive, right?
Also: true.
Our Universe Is a Special Case—And That’s Why Time Looks the Way It Does
Fascinatingly enough, the only reason why we can differentiate between the past and the present—which, in a much more fundamental sense, don’t really exist—is because we live in a universe whose entropy is low in the past
And only because of this, “the second law of thermodynamics obtains; memories exist, traces are left—and there can be evolution, life, and thought.”
In other words, as strange as it sounds, we’ve won the lottery. And that’s not merely the only reason why time looks to us the way it does—but also (and consequently) the only reason why we exist the way we do and understanding the things the way we understand them.

How Nations Cope with Crisis and Change
Ever experienced a personal crisis? Sure, you have! But have you ever wondered whether what you did during a personal crisis of yours can be applied to a nation in crisis?
Well, American polymath Jared Diamond has, and he thinks the answer to the previous question is “yes.” Allow him to make his argument in the majestic, “comparative, narrative, exploratory study of crisis and selective change” that is:
Who Should Read “Upheaval”? And Why?
If you are a history buff or a student of political science, then 
has everything you might want to find in a book: wars, crises, sadistic dictatorships, economic policies, the building of new nations.
But then again, it’s a Jared Diamond book, so that’s all but a given once you see his name on the cover. The only thing that’s left for you is to enjoy.
About Jared Diamond

“Upheaval PDF Summary”
“At one or more times during our lives,” writes Jared Diamond at the beginning of the “Prologue” to 
, “most of us undergo a personal upheaval or crisis, which may or may not get resolved successfully through our making personal changes.”
“Similarly,” he adds instantly, “nations undergo national crises, which also may or may not get resolved successfully through national changes. There is a large body of research and anecdotal information, built up by therapists, about the resolution of personal crises. Could the resulting conclusions help us understand the resolution of national crises?”
And that is what 
is all about.
To use Diamond’s beautiful description, it is “a comparative, narrative, exploratory study of crisis and selective change operating over many decades in seven modern nations… and viewed from the perspective of selective change in personal crises. Those nations are Finland, Japan, Chile, Indonesia, Germany, Australia, and the United States.”
Just look at a map of the world, and you’ll understand why these are the nations Diamond chose: in addition to having much personal experience with all of them, they also cover many distinctly different cultures and are located on all sides of the world.
But before devoting the rest of his book to national crises, Diamond reserves the introductory chapter for personal crises, believing that the factors which influence the likelihood of a personal crisis being successfully resolved have their parallels as far as the outcomes of national crises are concerned.
So, let’s start there.
Part 1: The 12 Factors Related to the Outcomes of Personal and National Crises
Personal crises are inevitable.
Whether sudden or gradual, whether in adolescence or after retirement, you must have experienced at least one.
And since everybody has, therapists have spent a lot of time analyzing their genealogy, their possible extent, and the ways one can overcome them. During this research, they have identified “at least a dozen factors,” which suggest whether an individual will or won’t succeed in resolving a personal crisis.
These 12 factors are the following ones:
1. Acknowledgment that one is in crisis
2. Acceptance of one’s personal responsibility to do something
3. Building a fence, to delineate one’s individual problems needing to be solved
4. Getting material and emotional help from other individuals and groups
5. Using other individuals as models of how to solve problems
6. Ego strength
7. Honest self-appraisal
8. Experience of previous personal crises
9. Patience
10. Flexible personality
11. Individual core values
12. Freedom from personal constraints
Most of the factors on the list above have “recognizable analogues” in the case of national crises (1-5 and 7-8), two are less specifically linked (9 and 12) and in the cases of three (6, 10 and 11), the individual factor serves just as a metaphor suggesting a factor describing nations.
Consequently, the 12 factors which Diamond believes are related to the outcomes of national crises are as follows:
1. National consensus that one’s nation is in crisis
2. Acceptance of national responsibility to do something
3. Building a fence, to delineate the national problems needing to be solved
4. Getting material and financial help from other nations
5. Using other nations as models of how to solve the problems
6. National identity
7. Honest national self-appraisal
8. Historical experience of previous national crises
9. Dealing with national failure
10. Situation-specific national flexibility
11. National core values
12. Freedom from geopolitical constraints
It is through these factors that Diamond is interested in analyzing several 20
-century crises (mostly) he was able to observe in person and in real-time; he dedicates the second part (i.e., most of his book) to these. The same holds true for our summary.
Part 2: National Crises
As you probably know, Finland is a Scandinavian country of about 6 million people which borders Sweden to the west and Russia to the east. We’ll be very surprised if you know something more than this, however: Finland wasn’t even a free country for most of history.
From the 13
 to the 19
 century it was considered a part of Sweden, but after 1809, it became a part of Russia. It remained so for the next century: during the Russian Revolution of 1917, fed up with an oppressive governor set by the Russian Tsar Nicholas II, Finland decided it has had enough and proclaimed its independence.
Unfortunately, being a small and rather undeveloped country located next to the biggest country in the world was a sure recipe for problems. And they got even bigger after the newly independent Finland became a liberal capitalist democracy, and the USSR the first communist country in the world.
All hell broke loose when Stalin became the President of the Soviet Union due to the very simple fact that he didn’t know what the words “compromise” or “negotiation” mean. 
It started that way, though: stating security reasons (defending Leningrad), the Soviets asked for some Finnish territories (in exchange for others), and, when Finland refused, on November 30, 1939, just three months after World War II had started, Stalin ordered an invasion of Finland. 
The event triggered what is generally known as the Winter War, a military conflict which officially lasted until March 13, 1940, and unofficially it went on throughout the war.
USSR, of course, won the Winter War, but, due to very smart tactics employed by the Finnish volunteers (camouflage, snipers, Molotov cocktails and machine guns), it suffered heavy losses (8 Soviet soldiers killed for every Finnish one), not to mention the bulk of its still fragile international reputation.
The most controversial tactic the Finns employed, however, was allying with the Nazis, hoping the Germans would help them defend from Soviet attacks.
They realized soon after that the Germans are not precisely the best ally one can have and started finally realizing that their crisis stems from a factor they can do nothing about: geography.
So, they smartly started building a fence to delineate the problems and think about solutions and adapted a new stance toward the Soviet Union to overcome the crisis once and for all.
For one, they declined to support the German troops in Leningrad—possibly a turning point not only in the Battle of Leningrad, but in the Second World War altogether. Of course, this was appreciated by everyone (including Stalin), so the Soviet planes started deliberately missing Finnish targets, dropping their bombs in Finnish waters.
However, since Finland was on the losing side after the war, it was still required that it pays $300 million to the USSR in reparations—in little over half a decade.
The Finns, true to Churchill’s adage to never let a good crisis go to waste, started looking at their crisis differently, using it to industrialize themselves and develop trading connections with everybody—above all, with the Soviet Union.
They also agreed to not talk ill of anything bad happening in the USSR, but self-censorship is not that bad a price to pay for earning your independence and developing a prosperous country on the very border of a mighty enemy.
After all, that’s how selective change works: you do what you can to achieve the necessary (good neighborly relations) and accept what you can’t change (the neighbor) even if it means sacrificing a bit of your former self.
Today, Japan is considered one of the great powers of the world, its economy being the world’s third-largest by GDP and fourth-largest by purchasing power parity.
However, up until the second half of the 19
 century, it was a feudal society, almost completely isolated from the world and uninterested in becoming a part of the modern technological processes.
And then, just like the USSR did in the case of Finland, the US forced Japan to modernize and become the country it is today.
It all started with the US discovering gold in California. As a result, it needed new ports to refuel its boats along their Pacific Ocean trading routes. US President Millard Fillmore asked for access to some of Japan’s ports in 1853, but he didn’t do it nicely: it was either that or something much worse.
Though the rulers of Japan weren’t so happy with a deal that practically got them nothing in return, they realized they had to make it, for they were no match to one of the fastest-developing and military most advanced countries in the world.
However, this caused internal crisis: most of the Japanese (especially the Samurai) were against such a deal, so a coup and civil war followed. It resulted in what is today known as the Meiji era, a period of forty or so years during which Japan evolved from a feudal society to a modern, industrialized nation, and became one of the world’s emergent great power.
Wait a minute, you say! But wasn’t the coup 
 this?
Yes, it was. But, as soon as they were installed, the new leaders realized that Japan risks being colonized by European superpowers unless it becomes a superpower itself.
Thus, Japan made the first step toward overcoming its crisis: acknowledging its situation and performing an honest-self 
. Now, was the time for selective changes.
True to the 12-step therapeutic program, Japan took other countries as role models: Germany for its constitution and army, Britain for its military ships and its navy.
However, they didn’t change entirely: they accepted many elements from the Western societies they were trying to emulate, but they remained true to most of their traditions, creating a unique blend of Asian patience and self-sacrificing character with a Western thirst for freedom and individualism.
The result?
They defeated the Russians during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 and announced to the world that they are a force to be reckoned with.
True, Russia was ruled ineffectively by Tsar Nicholas and was all but a feudal state, but this was, after all, the first victory of an Asian power over a European enemy.
Unlike most of the South American countries, Chile was a democratic nation for most of its existence. Ever since 1925, the country’s voting system prevented any of its three parties (left, centrist, and right) from taking total control.
It was so in 1970 as well, when Marxist Salvador Allende was chosen to be the President with about 36 percent of the vote. Even though—to quote a Chilean friend of Diamond—he had good ideas, Allende executed them poorly, adopting wrong solutions to the problems in question.
Most importantly, Allende ignored the fact that only a third of the Chilean voters gave him support, and that mighty powers (such as the Chilean armed forces, the Chilean capitalists, and, most importantly, the United States government) were among the two-thirds who were against him.
Yet, he nationalized US-owned copper companies, froze prices, replaced free-market elements of Chile’s economy with socialist-style state planning, granted big wage increases, greatly increased government spending, and printed paper money to cover the resulting government deficits.
The result?
Polarization of the political climate which brought an end to Chile’s democracy and installed a dictator in Allende’s place who was either murdered or committed suicide.
This is how Diamond sums up the situation:
Believe it or not, even though Chile’s democracy turned into a sadistic dictatorship in the span of just a few years, Pinochet’s decision to turn over the economy to 
 and the Chicago Boys was very beneficial in the long run.
True, Chile never re-privatized the copper mines (still responsible for 10% of Chile’s GDP), but everything else was left to the free market to decide. They decided that Chile will become the country with the highest GINI coefficient (meaning: wealth still isn’t distributed well in Chile), but also one of the most developed countries in the world.
Why would a dictator choose free-market policies remains unclear to this day. But Pinochet’s choice ultimately resulted in the stabilization of the Chilean society and the overcoming of its worst crisis.
Pretty much the same thing that happened in Chile during the 1970s happened on the other side of the world in the newly-created Indonesia.
Ruled by a left-leaning president ever since its foundation in 1945, Indonesia was hit by a very confusing crisis on September 30, 1965, when a communist faction of the army was blamed for the death of six supposedly corrupt generals.
Whether there was a communist plan to kill these generals remains uncertain to this very day, but it is quite possible that it was all a ploy by one of the army’s mightiest generals, Suharto, because, just like in Nazi Germany in 1933, as soon as the ploy became public, he ordered the extermination of the communist element in Indonesia.
And, just like under Pinochet’s rule in Chile, that’s precisely what happened under Suharto’s rule: between half a million and two million communist supporters were killed by people who are now deemed liberators of the country (if you haven’t, watch the brilliant documentary, 
, for more).
Suharto, as brutal and sadistic as he was, did employ a set of more moderate measures to fix Indonesia’s economy. Under the previous president, Sukarno, Indonesia aligned with China, but its economy was in shambles. Now it started making connections with the Western world. Unsurprisingly, Suharto too had his Chicago Boys. His economic team was dubbed, less courteously, the Berkeley Mafia.
Using foreign role models, the Berkeley Mafia successfully reduced Indonesia’s foreign debt and inflation, while balancing its budget, making the country a powerful international trading partner and global ideological player.
Once again, it was selective change by way of foreign role models that did the trick—even in the face of corruption and tyranny. Once again, a severe crisis was successfully overcome by using the knowledge garnered through similar experiences at some other places.
In 1945, Germany was not only covered in ruins, but it was also divided in half. There was a reason for this, of course: the Allies believed that only a divided Germany would be unable to industrialize quickly and start another war.
However, just a few years after the war had ended, it was more than obvious to the United States that this was a risk it was willing to take because it was far more dangerous to leave the Soviet Union to expand its influence across Europe.
So, West Germany became part of the Marshall Plan, an American initiative to rebuild European economies after the war so that it can prevent the spread of communism.
The plan worked like a charm: from a country set back at least half a century, West Germany became the most highly developed European nation. It introduced a powerful new currency (the Deutsche Mark) and joined the free market both as one of the world’s topmost exporters and importers of goods.
When Willy Brandt became West Germany’s first left-wing chancellor, things took a turn for the better. 
The reason?
Brandt was ready to stop playing the role of a victim, and accept responsibility for Germany’s past sins. He apologized to neighboring countries and asked even Eastern bloc nations for forgiveness. At the same type, he supported American policies (including the Vietnam War) and was patient and flexible as far as the story of Germany’s reunification was concerned.
Eventually, in 1989, this happened, but it owes a lot to Brandt and the policies enacted during his reign.
After the end of the Second World War, Australia faced one of the strangest crises a country can ever face. 
You see, unlike Finland or Japan, Australia wasn’t interested in becoming an independent nation; on the contrary: it wanted to be part of the British Empire.
The problem was that the British Empire didn’t want to bother with Australia anymore. It simply disowned the country during the 1950s, reducing its military presence and opting to focus its trading interests on mainland Europe.
The Australians begged and begged and then realized that they have only themselves to rely on from now on. They couldn’t influence Britain’s decision, but they were able to do something about it. This was the first honest self-assessment of Australia.
It yielded some good results—the country started developing—but also some disastrous outcomes—its immigration minister, Arthur Calwell, was openly racist and was interested in accepting only white immigrants.
In 1972, when finally the Labor Party won, Australia made another honest assessment of itself and realized that it has to selectively change and become a country of its own.
First of all, since Britain was so far away, it had to improve its relations with its immediate neighbors, most importantly China. It also had to change its immigration policies and start accepting everyone: it needed people, and it needed them now. Finally, it needed to enact a policy of equal pay for women—for hundreds of obvious reasons.
The best example of selective change happened in 1999, when Australia finally recognized Britain as a foreign country, while symbolically still pledging allegiance to England’s Queen.
It lost something but not everything; and as it happens in the case of overcoming crises, what it lost was actually a gain in the long run.
Part 3: Nations and the World
In the third part, Diamond applies the lessons learned from the six crises described above to the current state of affairs in the United States and the world.
True, he says, just like Chile, Japan or Australia, 
, and it is difficult to apply the lessons from other countries to one that has a pretty exceptional development, but he warns that many symptoms are there and that we must be careful lest we want to be mangled by a crisis of unforeseen proportions.
For, just like Chile, the United States is nowadays 
: for the first time in sixty years or so, people are severely divided along many lines—politically even more so than otherwise. In the absence of compromise, democracy is the first thing that suffers, so 
.
It couldn’t happen here?
Well, that was the same thing Chileans thought until the beginning of the 1970s; and then they became a sadistic dictatorship.
Another thing which suggests that things are not going in the right direction in the US is the fact that, after the African-Americans were given the right to vote in the 1960s, governments are continually subverting people’s right to vote.
For example, the voter ID law requires every voter to have a current and valid photo ID to vote. However, in Texas, there are so few places which issue IDs or driver’s licenses that some people have to travel hundreds of miles to reach them.
Even worse, they work only during working hours, practically disqualifying the poorest people who can’t take a day off to travel to the nearest DMV.
 is another thing the US doesn’t care one bit about, even though it is a scientific consensus that it is happening, and that its results may be devastating.
For compassion, even though reducing consumption is a good way to tackle this problem, the US consumes twice the amount of oil per capita when compared to Western Europe, even though the quality of life is generally higher on the other side of the Atlantic.
Even scarier, it recently opted out of the Paris Agreement.
Diamond warns: there are some issues which should not be left to the countries to solve but should be solved on an international, global level.
As Colin Kidd from 
writes, “the prophet spares us chiseled commandments, but we have been warned.”
Indeed, we have.
Key Lessons from “Upheaval”
1.      Individuals and Nations Have One Thing in Common: The Way They Overcome Crises
2.      Overcoming Crisis Is All About Selective Changing
3.      Other Nations’ Past Crises Can Teach Us a Lot About Current Problems
Individuals and Nations Have One Thing in Common: The Way They Overcome Crises
Almost all people, at a certain age or time (adolescence, the loss of a loved one, job loss, retirement, widowing, etc.) are bound to face a crisis. Be it internal (say, becoming sick) or external (being deserted by a spouse), an individual must 
 to some extent to overcome this crisis.
Therapists have developed “a road-map of a dozen factors that help us to understand the varying outcomes” of an individual crisis. Interestingly enough, the same 12 factors seem applicable in the case of nations in crises.
Overcoming Crisis Is All About Selective Changing
Now, as we said above, an individual or a nation must 
to some extent to overcome a crisis. However, the keyword in Jared Diamond’s book is “selective.” 
He writes:
Other Nations’ Past Crises Can Teach Us a Lot About Current World Problems
In 
Diamond analyzes six 20
 century crises: Finland’s Winter War with the USSR, the birth of Modern Japan during the Meiji era, the Allende/Pinochet years in Chile, the Sukarno/Suharto switch in Indonesia, Germany after the War, and Britain-less Australia of the second half of the past century.
The reason why he does this is quite simple: he believes that through these case studies we can learn not only the ways in which a country can overcome a crisis but also the problems the world is facing nowadays.
A comparison with Chile of the 1970s, for example, reveals that the US may become a totalitarian country as well—if we are not careful.
And that’s a Jared Diamond warning.

Our Critical Review
Though

“Though the analysis stumbles,” writes Moisés Naím in 
,
the virtues of Diamond’s storytelling shine through.” And he advises us to ignore Diamond’s “attempts to force the therapeutic 12-step onto history” or “his correct but unsurprising musings about the dangerous threats facing humanity.”Instead, he says, let the experienced observer that is Diamond “take you on an expedition around the world and through fascinating, pivotal moments in seven countries.”

Who Should Read “Blitzscaling”? And Why?
“This book is for anyone who wants to understand the techniques that allow a business to grow from zero to a multibillion-dollar market leader in a handful of years,” write the authors of 
 themselves in a chapter that all but shares the title above.
“Whether you are a founder, a manager, a potential employee, or an investor,” they add, “we believe that understanding blitzscaling will allow you to make better decisions in a world where speed is the critical competitive advantage.”
Blitzscaling PDF Summary
“When a start-up matures to the point where it has a killer product, a clear and sizable market, and a robust distribution channel,” writes Reid Hoffman in the “Introduction” to 
, “it has the opportunity to become a ‘scale-up,’ which is a world-changing company that touches millions or even billions of lives.”
“Often,” he adds, “the fastest and most direct path from start-up to scale-up is the hypergrowth produced by blitzscaling.”
Never heard that word before?
Well, that’s where this book and our summary might come in handy.
As you have probably already guessed, the authors (Reid Hoffman and Chris Yeah) use this book to introduce the concept of blitzscaling, to go over its advantages and disadvantages, and to explain why “the key to rapidly building massive businesses in today’s environment is [this] aggressive growth strategy.”
To do this, they use quite a lot of lists and sublists; we’ll try to include them all in our summary, but, due to its limited space, we’ll delve into more details only in the case of the most important ones.
So, let’s go!
PART I What Is Blitzscaling?
As it should be fairly obvious, “blitzscaling” is a portmanteau of two words: the German “blitz” and the Latin-based English “scaling.” 
, but as far as the former is concerned, you may require some explanation. (That is unless you are a World War II buff, football fan, or, well, English.)
In German, “blitz” means “lightning” and is the word the British press adopted to describe, in short (from “blitzkrieg”), the brutal, rapid, all-out attacks organized by Nazi Germany’s General Heinz Guderian.
By analogy, in football, “all-out blitz” defense means sending every available defender to pursue the QB: a risky move which sometimes pays off.
It’s the same in business: 
 “strives for a relentless and dizzying speed that overwhelms the market” and can be defined as a framework or a set of specific techniques which allows companies to achieve massive scale at incredible speed.
Blitzscaling, in other words, means growing at such a fast rate that it makes you dizzy, even uncomfortable.
It is one of the 
, which can be best illustrated via this table:
As you can probably deduct from the table, blitzscaling means prioritizing speed over efficiency and uncertainty over certainty.
To understand it better, it is a good idea to first understand 
:
1. Blitzscaling is both an offensive strategy and a defensive strategy.
2. Blitzscaling thrives on positive feedback loops, in that the company that grows to scale first reaps significant competitive advantages.
3. Despite its incredible advantages and potential payoffs, blitzscaling also comes with massive risks.
In addition, these are 
:
• Stage 1 (Family): 1–9 employees
• Stage 2 (Tribe): 10s of employees
• Stage 3 (Village): 100s of employees
• Stage 4 (City): 1000s of employees
• Stage 5 (Nation): 10000s of employees 
And, finally, these are 
:
• Business Model Innovation
• Strategy innovation
• Management Innovation
To mimic the structure of the book, we’ll go over each of these in the following sections.
PART II Business Model Innovation
“Of the three core techniques of blitzscaling,” note Hoffman and Yeh, “the first and most foundational is to design an innovative business model capable of exponential growth.”
“What sets companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook apart,” they go on, “
, is that they have consistently been able to design and execute business models with characteristics that allow them to quickly achieve massive scale and sustainable competitive advantage.”
Most of these business models share certain characteristics; and if you want to find 
 best business model, it is a good idea to design one which maximizes the four key growth factors and minimizes the two key growth limiters. 
The four growth factors are the following:
: this is, of course, the most basic growth factor; either find an already large or a fast-growing market; otherwise, blitzscaling is, by definition, impossible;
: the cold and unromantic fact is that, even if you have an “insanely great” product and just poor distribution, a good product with great distribution will always beat you; the distribution techniques to consider fall into two general categories:
• 
 (PayPal used eBay, Airbnb – Craigslist);
• 
(which must be free or freemium: “We can’t recall a single instance of a company that grew to a massive scale by leveraging the virality of a paid product.”)
: as you know, gross margins = sales – the cost of goods sold; the higher they are, the better things are in the long run. (“Many high-tech businesses have high gross margins by default, which is why this factor is often overlooked. Software businesses have high gross margins because the cost of duplicating software is essentially zero.”)
: #1 to #3 are important factors in growing a company, but #4 is the one which 
this growth long enough so that you can build a lasting and massively valuable franchise. According to Arun Sundararajan, there are 5 broad categories of network effects:
• 
: Increases in usage leads to direct increases in value (Facebook, WhatsApp);
• 
: Increases in usage encourages consumption of complementary goods, which, in turn, increases the value of the original product (the adoption of an operating system encourages third-party app developers to build apps for that system)
• 
: Increases in usage by one set of users increases the value to a different set of complementary users, and vice versa. (eBay, Uber, and Airbnb)
• 
: Increases in usage by a small subset of users increases the value for a connected user. (Remember that time when you could specify a limited number of favorite numbers whom you could call for free?)
• 
: The use of one technology product encourages the use of compatible products. (Microsoft Office encouraged people to use the Office suite)
“Building key growth factors into your innovative business model is only half the battle,” note Hoffman and Yeh. “It is fiendishly difficult to grow an amazing business, in part because it is fiendishly easy to run smack into obstacles that limit your growth. A key component of business model innovation is designing around these growth limiters.”
There are two growth limiters that you must build around if you want to blitzscale:
: “Product/market fit,” wrote 
 a while back, “means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.” Obvious as it sounds, many people seem to forget that without a good product/market fit, it is impossible to grow a start-up into a successful business.
 – the bigger the company, the more people you need (human limitations) and the bulkier the nonhuman part should be (infrastructure limitations); even with smart tactics, you can’t delay the problems forever.
A proven business model pattern means a sequence of steps which proves successful in more than one case. This is a list of seven such models:
Google and Facebook are a great example of this: bits-based businesses have fewer variable costs, high gross margins, and make it easier to design the business model 
 growth limiters. Bits, simply put, are iterative and easier to move around than atoms.
 
Software-based platforms can achieve global distribution almost immediately. Amazon’s merchant platform, Facebook’s social graph, and, of course, Apple’s iOS ecosystem are great examples of the power of platforms.
As 
, free products would almost always end up bringing users, and the interested ones would almost always upgrade to a paid version if happy with the product.
Local market places have been a valuable business model ever since time immemorial; the Internet allowed them to become Airbnb, eBay, Google.
Subscription allows great distribution with no effort: that’s why software-as-a-service (
) is becoming the dominant model for streaming entertainment and enterprise software. 
This sits at the intersection of #1 and #2 and works with intangible products with practically no intrinsic value: the messaging service LINE, for example, derives significant revenues by selling “stickers.”
One of the most underrated and underappreciated proven patterns is the news feed: 
.
“Underlying the proven patterns of business model innovation are larger principles that can help refine those patterns or even create new ones,” write Hoffman and Yeh. “These principles aren’t themselves business models, but they often power the technological innovation that enables business model innovation.”
Put otherwise, 
:
• 
, i.e., predict the future of technology
• 
, i.e., automate everything that can be automated
• 
, i.e., constantly improve
• 
, aka 
PART III Strategy Innovation
“To blitzscale or not to blitzscale is a strategic (and difficult) choice,” warn Hoffman and Yeh at the beginning of the third part of 
.
So, when should you blitzscale?
The answer may give you these 
:
• 
: it often arises because a technological innovation creates a new market or scrambles an existing one (e.g., YouTube appeared when the networks were finally big enough to stream video).
• 
: “The most frequent offensive reason for blitzscaling is to achieve a critical mass that confers a lasting competitive advantage.” (e.g., Uber, Airbnb)
• 
: if you can be the first to climb a steep learning curve, blitzscale (e.g., Netflix and self-driving cars)
• 
: if you want to leave your competitors in the dust (e.g., Netflix going into debt to create new content so as to drive his competitors out of the game)
• 
: sometimes, blitzscaling works even in less than hot markets (Google during the dot-com bubble)
• 
There are also a few 
• Declining rate of growth (relative to the market and competition)
• Worsening unit economics
• Decreasing per-employee productivity 
• Increasing management overhead
Of course, even if you 
 blitzscale, it doesn’t mean that you 
. But it seems that’s 
 best strategy for our modern times.
And it updates 
’s 3-step scaling process (from his 2013 essay “Do Things That Don’t Scale”):
• Step 1: Do things that don’t scale.
• Step 2: Achieve scale.
• Step 3: Do things that scale.
—into this 
:
• Step 1: Do things that don’t scale.
• Step 2: Reach the next stage of blitzscaling.
• Step 3: Figure out how to do one set of things that scale, while somehow also finding a way to do a completely different set of things that don’t scale.
• Step 4: Reach the next stage of blitzscaling.
• Step 5: Repeat over and over until you reach complete market dominance.
Of course, 
 changes in each of the stages of growth :
• Stage 1 (Family): the founder personally pulls the levers of hypergrowth
• Stage 2 (Tribe): the founder manages the people who are pulling the levers
• Stage 3 (Village): the founder designs an organization that pulls the levers
• Stage 4 (City): the founder makes high-level decisions about goals and strategies
• Stage 5 (Nation): the founder figures out how to pull the organization back from blitzscaling and start blitzscaling new product lines and business units
PART IV Management Innovation
“One of the key features that sets global giants apart from those companies that flame out or implode before they can reach market dominance,” write Hoffman and Yeh, “is an ability to evolve and optimize their management practices at each stage of growth.”
The proven techniques here fall into two main categories: eight key transitions (“which help guide the company through the stages of blitzscaling”), and nine counterintuitive rules (“which turn the conventional wisdom of traditional management on its head in order to cope with blitzscaling’s frenzied pace of growth.”)
These are the 8 key transitions you should consider when you blitzscale:
This is the first and most obvious blitzscaling transition: when you go from tribe to village, it is almost impossible to keep a small team anymore.
During the village stage, it is a necessity to hire specialists and turn some of the generalists you already have into specialists so that you sustain your growth.
Executives are the ones who lead the managers who are, in turn, all about the day-to-day tactics. When you’re blitzscaling, the ideal is to hire executives with past blitzscaling experience, which is, of course, also the reason why investors have more confidence in serial entrepreneurs.
If you can’t hire someone like that, then use this three-step process:
1. Hire someone who is already a known quantity to at least one member of the team.
2. Bring the new executive in at a lower level initially and let the executive prove himself or herself.
3. Once the executive has earned the team’s trust and credibility, consider promoting him or her.
At the Family stage, the whole company is working under one roof, possibly even one room, so communication is not the problem. However, as early as the Tribe stage, you need company meetings. 
At the Village stage, the company exceeds the Dunbar’s number, so the founder needs to find creative ways to broadcast the messages to far-flung employees and keep their morale high as well.
At the early stages, it’s all about inspiration and passion. At the village stage, they need to make space for data-driven approaches: almost all village-size businesses who have blitzscaled have used dashboards to assess the progress of their companies.
“Start-ups in the early stages of blitzscaling are generally single-product companies that focus on doing one thing extremely well. But to keep the company growing in the later stages, scale-ups need to manage multiple product lines or even business units.”
At the
“Nation” stage, it is important to start acquiring other start-ups: this is when you transform your offense into a specific type of defense. You have a lasting competitive advantage? Restructure so that you don’t allow your competitors space to narrow the gap.
If you are the founder of a blitzscaling start-up, you need to blitzscale yourself. There are only three ways to scale yourself: delegation, amplification, and just plain making yourself better.
These are the 9 counterintuitive rules of blitzscaling:
To quote Hoffman and Yeh, “entrepreneurs should always have a Plan A, a Plan B, and a Plan Z.”
Plan A is your best current plan; Plan B is an alternate plan, and Plan Z is your fallback plan for surviving a worst-case scenario. 
“ABZ planning gives you multiple opportunities to recover from mistakes or setbacks.”
“Hiring someone who has been managing a thousand people to run a ten-person company is actually counterproductive,” write Hoffman and Yeh, “because the skills needed to succeed during those two phases are very different.” So, instead of Ms. Right, hire Ms. Right Now, “Now” referring to the stage of your development.
This
should be obvious by definition: in blitzscaling, speed is more important than having a “well-run” organization.
If you need to choose between the perfect product tomorrow and the imperfect product today—always choose the latter.
Prioritize
your problems
using Hoffman and Yeh’s Maslovian hierarchy of fires:  #1 Distribution; #2 Product; #3. Revenue model; #4. Operations; #5 Competition; #6What’s next?
“To prioritize speed, you might invest less in security, write code that isn’t scalable, and wait for things to start breaking before you build QA tools and processes,” note Hoffman and Yeh.
Of course, all of this will bring you problems later on, but by then you’ll have billions of dollars to solve them. 
To sum up, “a hack that takes a tenth of the time may be more useful than an elegantly engineered solution, even if it has to be thrown away later.”
Really: it seems that most of the blitzscaling start-ups that have grown into multi-billion corporation offer no support or only email support at the beginning, hoping that users would find and help each other on wiki-based encyclopedias and/or discussion forums.
Raise enough cash for 2 years of operations: see the example of Netflix.
Ignoring your customers
is good, but Ignoring your own culture is never an option. Invest both time and resources 
 and become a brand!
PART V The Broader Landscape of Blitzscaling
The last two parts of 
 are comparatively not as important as the first four parts so we’ll just breeze through them.
In Part V, Hoffman and Ye go over the 
(scale, iteration, longevity, mergers & acquisitions) and the 
(incentives, unstaged commitment, public market pressure) 
 
Then they offer these established companies three blitzscaling hacks:
• Find ways to leverage people and businesses with prior Blitzscaling experience;
• Leverage the knowledge of venture capitalists;
• Treat the new initiative as a company within a company.
Finally, after introducing the readers to China as “The Land of Blitzscaling,” they go over the three options the companies who compete against blitzscalers have at their disposal to defend: beat them, join them, or avoid them until they collapse.
PART VI Responsible Blitzscaling
In the final part, Hoffman and Yeh talk about the other side of the coin of blitzscaling: as with all other growth processes, you are responsible for much more than your company and the profits, but also for how your business impacts society and humanity in general.
Key Lessons from “Blitzscaling”
1.      Blitzscaling Is the New Scaling
2.      If Blitzscaling, There Are Four Growth Factors and Two Growth Limiters to Consider 
3.      There Are Seven Proven Business Model Blitzscaling Patterns
Blitzscaling Is the New Scaling
You can scale up in several different ways. If you’re going for speed and uncertainty rather than efficiency and certainty, then you’re blitzscaling.
Blitzscaling means trying to create a lasting competitive advantage through several specific techniques, which are risky but which, in the long run, may lead to you trampling over your competition.
If Blitzscaling, There Are Four Growth Factors and Two Growth Limiters to Consider 
If you are blitzscaling, you should consider these four growth factors: 
• Market size
• Distribution
• High gross margins
• Network effects
However, you should also build around the two growth limitations:
• Lack of product/market fit
• Operational scalability
There Are Seven Proven Business Model Blitzscaling Patterns
There are seven proven business model blitzscaling patterns:
• Bits rather than atoms (Google, Facebook)
• Platforms (Amazon, Apple’s iOS ecosystem)
• Free or Freemium (Dropbox)
• Marketplaces (Airbnb, eBay)
• Subscriptions (Netflix)
• Digital goods (LINE and stickers)
• Feeds (Twitter)

Blitzscaling Quotes
Final Notes
may not be a book about everybody—for not every company is a Google or a Facebook—but it is definitely a book about established companies with a great product/market fit.
In fact, it may be the best one: after all, Reid Hoffman is the guy who co-founded PayPal and LinkedIn, in addition to being an angel investor in Facebook. 
So, you do the math if you want to hear his advice when it comes to scaling up.
“The case studies you’re about to explore, and the tools you’re about to gain have never been more relevant,” writes Bill Gates in the “Foreword.” “This is an ideal moment to be reading this book,” he adds."

Who Should Read “The Inner Game of Tennis”? And Why?
is written by a tennis instructor and, though it uses tennis as a metaphor to talk about other things as well, most of its conclusions and advices would interest tennis players (or athletes, in general) the most.
However, give it a go even if you’re an entrepreneur: it may boost your performance by telling you when you should be a 
, and when just a 
.
The Inner Game of Tennis Summary
“Every game is composed of two parts,” writes tennis instructor W. Timothy Gallwey, “an outer game and an inner game.”
It is, he goes on, the inner game you need to win so as to have any chance in winning the outer game.
Wondering what that means in practice?
We’re here to explain.
The Outer and the Inner Game of Tennis
The outer game is the one played against an external opponent to overcome external obstacles and to reach an external goal. 
If you’re playing the game of tennis, then mastering the outer game means learning how to position your arms and legs, how to swing a racket, or how to improve your forehand. The goal, of course, is to beat your opponent and, in the long run, win Wimbledon.
There are many books which offer instructions on how to achieve this; but, for some reason, reminds as Gallwey, “most of us find these instructions easier to remember than to execute.”
And that’s where the inner game of tennis comes into play.
This is the game that takes place inside the mind of a player. It, too, includes some obstacles: lapses in concentration, nervousness, self-doubt, and self-condemnation. It, too, has a goal: proper preparation for the outer-game instructions.
In short, you play the outer game to beat your opponent; you play the inner one to beat your own self, “to overcome all habits of mind which inhibit excellence in performance.”
This
book is about the latter.
“There is a far more natural and effective process for learning and doing almost anything than most of us realize,” writes Gallwey in the “Introduction” to his book. “It is similar to the process we all used, but soon forgot, as we learned to walk and talk. It uses the intuitive capabilities of the mind and both the right and left hemispheres of the brain. This process doesn’t have to be learned; we already know it. All that is needed is to 
 those habits which interfere with it and then to just 
.”
Let’s see how that works in actual life.
The Discovery of Two Selves
“Don’t think about elephants,” says Arthur to Saito in 
to make a point.
“What are you thinking about?” “Elephants,” replies Saito.
Called 
, this thinking process is a demonstration of the main reason why you might be losing the outer game of tennis (or negotiation, or business, or life) no matter how prepared you are.
Simply put, you are not 
 to play it as consciously as you’d like to believe.
You are, in other words, a 
: you think that you are one indivisible individual, when, in fact, you consist of two very different selves:
• Self 1: Your Conscious Mind;
• Self 2: Your Unconscious Mind.
The reason why you are incapable of 
 thinking about elephants when asked to is that there’s a breakdown in communication between the two selves: Self 1 tells Self 2 to do this, but Self 2 isn’t rational by definition.
And therein lies the problem: using conscious effort to overcome self-doubt or lack of focus and concentration is like using a hammer to paint a wall—the tool is utterly unusable and may, in fact, cause problems rather than lead to proper solutions.
We’ve talked about one real-world basketball example: Nick Anderson.
, the guy was a good free throw shooter, scoring, on average, 3 out of four free throws. However, after missing four very important ones, he went from that to scoring only 1 of 4!
Of course, he still had the same skills. 
The problem was—
—that, instead of shooting on autopilot (Self2), Anderson started 
 himself (Self 1) to shoot better.
And that’s the very definition of choking.
The Miscommunication Between the Selves
In short, the nub of this problem—
—is 
 and 
 
 between the two selves that comprise you.
But, let’s break down this sentence so you can understand it better.
Self 1 is the smart guy in your body: he is the one that’s doing all the thinking, organizing, strategizing and analyzing—from every possible angle; he does this in a pretty slow, careful, and meticulous manner.
Self 2, on the other hand, is the doer: he is the one that absorbs all the knowledge when it turns into habit; consequently, 
.
Self 1, in other words, is you copying text from one document, pasting it in another, and clicking Enter afterward—and doing this manually a hundred times; Self 2 is the script that Self 1 quickly jots down to do this automatically.
Why?
Well, Self 1 doesn’t want to waste energy solving solved problems a thousand times. There are simply too many problems around, so, after realizing that a particular string of steps works in a particular scenario, it relocates this pattern from the realm of the conscious to the realm of the unconscious; and then Self 2 takes things over and does all the work.
When you choke, this system works backward: Self 1 stops trusting Self 2 to do a job it has done millions of times before immaculately and takes the reins.
So, even though Self 2 embodies 
 the potential you have developed up to a certain moment—and, thus, is far more competent to control the muscle system than Self 1—Self 1, the slow talker, hijacks your body.
And, when it doesn’t respond properly, starts admonishing it by shouting things like “Stop being so nervous!” “You fool!” etc.
Fortunately, there’s a two-step way out.
Step 1: Quiet Self 1
It is, evidently, “the constant ‘thinking’ activity of Self 1, the ego-mind, which causes interference with the natural capabilities of Self 2. Harmony between the two selves exists when this mind is quiet and focused. Only then can peak performance be reached.”
In other words, you’re “in the zone” when you’re 
 thinking about 
, 
 or even 
 to hit the ball. 
Hell, when you’re in the zone, you’re not even 
 to hit the ball: you just 
 it. And, afterward, you’re not thinking about the quality of the shot: you’re just waiting for the next ball.
Like a machine.
“The ball,” says Gallwey, “seems to get hit through a process which doesn’t require thought. There may be an awareness of the sight, sound, and feel of the ball, and even of the tactical situation, but the player just seems to 
 without thinking what to do.”
“Man is a thinking reed,” wrote Zen master D. T. Suzuki, “but his great works are done when he is not calculating and thinking. ‘Childlikeness’ has to be restored…”
What does this mean?
It means that the first step toward mastery is quieting all thought—and especially judgmental thought—and seeing things as a child would, i.e., not 
(in the past or the future), but with serenity and relaxation (in the now).
This is what Gallwey calls 
. 
“When we ‘unlearn’ judgment,” he says, “we discover, usually with some surprise, that we don’t need the motivation of a reformer to change our ‘bad’ habits. We may simply need to be more aware.”
If so, that means that, almost counter-intuitively, if you want to get better at something you’ve been learning your whole life, the best thing to do is to… 
 
.
Instead…
Step 2: Trust Self 2
Trusting Self 2 means trusting the scripts planted inside your body, i.e., 
 things happen.
“
 it happen is not 
 it happen,” writes Gallwey in the most quotable sentence from the book. “It is not 
 hard. It is 
 your shots.”
Why?
Because these are all actions of Self 1, which only takes things into its own hands when it doesn’t trust Self 2 enough. 
“This is what produces tight muscles, rigid swings, awkward movements, gritted teeth and tense cheek muscles,” Gallwey goes on. “The results are mishit balls and a lot of frustration. Often when we are rallying, we trust our bodies and let it happen because the ego-mind tells itself that it doesn’t really count. But once the game begins, watch Self 1 take over; at the crucial point, it starts to doubt whether Self 2 will perform well. The more important the point, the more Self 1 may try to control the shot, and this is exactly when tightening up occurs. The results are almost always frustrating.”
To sum up, nothing good comes out of Self 1 trying to micromanage Self 2: on the contrary, in fact, this is a very certain and definite recipe for disaster.
Self 2 is very good at performing tasks which are automatic, like riding a bike or driving a car. It’s when you start thinking about how complex are the things you are doing that you may make a mistake.
A great tactic to prevent yourself from this is visualizing yourself on the court long before the match begins: to Self 2, a picture is worth a thousand words.
A good rule of thumb is until you get it right in your head, your Self 1 won’t trust your Self 2. 
So, 
!
Key Lessons from “The Inner Game of Tennis”
1.      You Consist Of Two Selves: The Conscious and the Unconscious You
2.      Choking is the Product of Miscommunication Between the Two Selves
3.      To Get Better: Quiet Self 1 and Trust Self 2 More
You Consist Of Two Selves: The Conscious and the Unconscious You
He may have been wrong about many things,  but 
 was definitely right about one: people are not whole and complete beings, but pretty fragmented creatures.
There’s a contest inside our bodies, and tennis instructor W. Timothy Gallwey refers to this contest as the inner game of tennis: before you’re capable of beating your opponent, you need to find a way to beat yourself.
Or better yet: to balance the two selves which are inside you.
The first one is the conscious self: the thinking entity; the latter one is the unconscious self: the doing entity. It is Self 1 which comes up with solutions; it is Self 2 which puts them into practice.
Choking is the Product of Miscommunication Between the Two Selves
Choking is the result of miscommunication between these two selves: Self 1 takes over things which are in the domain of Self 2 believing that it will make them better—when, in truth, Self 2 does a pretty great job 
when not interfered.
Fortunately, there’s a way to prevent this; but it’s counter-intuitive.
To Get Better: Quiet Self 1 and Trust Self 2 More
It is only normal that the first thing you’d do when things would start to go awry is you activate Self 1: it is the smart part of you, so it should have a solution.
Unfortunately, in this case, Self 1 is 
the problem: you don’t need to think when you’re driving or riding a bike, and, just as well, you don’t need to think when you’re shooting free throws or playing tennis.
You just need to do stuff.
Well, Self 1 isn’t very good at doing things: it doesn’t know your body as well as Self 2 does. So, you need to quiet it down by reserving all judgment and becoming aware that your inner mechanism is being hacked.
Step 2 is the other side of the coin: let things go. Just trust your Self 2 more and let it make all the decisions on autopilot.
If that backhand shot has worked out well 9 out of 10 times in practice, you have nothing to worry about it anymore.

The Inner Game of Tennis Quotes
Final Notes
As we said above, despite its subtitle (“The Classic Guide to the Mental Side of Peak Performance”), 
is primarily about tennis players. We tried to make its conclusions more general in our summary, but it is fairly obvious that tennis players (and athletes) would profit from this book much more than any other group of people.
Even so, the book is fairly short and comprehensible, and if you take the game of tennis as a metaphor and rush through some of the more tennis-specific suggestions and instructions, we guarantee you that you won’t be losing your time.After all,

Who Should Read “The Culture Code”? And Why?
“If you want to understand how successful groups work—the signals they transmit, the language they speak, the cues that foster creativity—you won’t find a more essential guide than 
” wrote none other than Charles Duhigg, author of 
.
Recommended especially for leaders, managers, and CEOs who want to organize their employees into unified, cohesive, and unstoppable juggernauts of work teams.
The Culture Code Summary
After demonstrating in 
 that individual greatness isn’t born, but grown, in 
,
Daniel Coyle turns to team greatness and tries to uncover the secrets of highly successful groups.
And he starts with a simple question: 
Introduction
Fortunately for Coyle, Peter Skillman, a designer and engineer, tried to give an answer to the question above just a few years ago via an interesting series of studies which included a simple challenge: building the tallest possible structure using the four following items:
• twenty pieces of uncooked spaghetti
• one yard of transparent tape
• one yard of string
• one standard-size marshmallow
The only two rules of the contest were: 
• the marshmallow had to end up on top
• the groups had to consist of four people
The business students who took participation in this experiment were “professional, rational, and intelligent.” They started by examining the materials and devising a proper strategy. Then they divided up the tasks and started building.
Interestingly, neither they nor the lawyers or the CEOs built the tallest structures. It was, believe it or not, the kindergartners that won.
“In dozens of trials,” writes Coyle, “kindergartners built structures that averaged twenty-six inches tall, while business school students built structures that averaged less than ten inches.” In case you’re wondering, the towers of the lawyers’ averaged fifteen inches and those of the CEOs twenty-two.
So, what happened? How did the kindergartners do it?
Strangely enough, by 
 strategizing or analyzing anything beforehand. They just started building, abruptly grabbing materials from one another and speaking in short bursts: “Here! No, 
!” Their entire technique was nothing more but 
.
“The kindergartners succeed not because they are smarter,” writes Coyle, “but because they work together in a smarter way. They are tapping into a simple and powerful method in which a group of ordinary people can create a performance far beyond the sum of their parts.”
The Method
Unsurprisingly, Coyle’s book—and, consequently, our summary—is the story of how and why the kindergarten method works.
Its final formulation, of course, owes a lot to modern scientific findings, but also, even more, to Coyle’s dedicated research: he spent four years visiting and researching “eight of the world’s most successful groups, including a special-ops military unit, an inner-city school, a professional basketball team, a movie studio, a comedy troupe, a gang of jewel thieves, and others.”
To be subject of his research, the groups had to have the following three qualifications:
• they had to have performed in the top 1 percent of their domain for at least a decade (where applicable);
• they had to have succeeded with a range of different personnel; and
• they had to have built a culture admired by knowledgeable people across their industry and beyond.
What Coyle found was that all of these cultures are created by a specific set of skills. These skills, he says, tap into the power of our social brains to create interactions exactly like the ones used by the kindergartners building the spaghetti tower. Interestingly, they are three in total:
: “signals of connection generate bonds of belonging and identity.” 
: “habits of mutual risk drive trusting cooperation.”
: “narratives create shared goals and values.” 
“The three skills work together from the bottom up,” Coyle writes, “first building group connection and then channeling it into action.”
So, let’s explore how each of these skills works—both in theory and in practice!
Skill 1 · Build Safety
Nick is a handsome, dark-haired man in his twenties with a simple mission: to sabotage the performance of a four-person group in a wood-paneled conference room in Seattle.
It’s not like he’s a bad person or something: he’s merely part of an experiment run by the not-so-mad Australian scientist Will Felps.
Felps has hired Nick so as to investigate organizational behavior, and, with this in mind, has tasked him to portray three negative archetypes inside forty different four-person groups tasked with devising a marketing plan for a start-up.
The negative archetypes in question are the following:
• The Jerk: an aggressive, defiant deviant;
• The Slacker: a withholder of effort; and 
• The Downer: a depressive Eeyore type.
For obvious reasons, Felps calls this “the bad apple” experiment.
For even more obvious reason, the results are not at all surprising: almost all groups react the way a body would if injected with a deadly virus—after some struggle, they discover that resistance is futile and give up.
The only exception: the Jonathan group.
The reason?
The Jonathan group has, well, a Jonathan, “a thin, curly-haired young man with a quiet, steady voice and an easy smile,” who constantly counters Nick’s efforts to ruin everything with warmth and understanding.
Basically, he works as an antiviral medication: he deflects the effects of Nick’s behavior, making everybody around him feel safe and secure.
The conclusion of this study—and a few similar ones—is twofold:
• Group performance doesn’t depend solely on measurable abilities like intelligence, skill, and experience: small “bad apple” behaviors are capable of ruining everything;
• Bad apples can be countered via something called belonging cues: if a member of a group makes the other members feel safe, protected, and solidly connected, the “bad apple” effects are canceled out.
In other words, if you want a group that will outperform its members, then you want them to be solidly connected, i.e., to form a single body from which everyone benefits.
The key thing to do that is building a safe environment by “dialing into small, subtle moments and delivering targeted signals at key points.”
Here are a few tips for doing that:
. Smooth turn-taking sessions peopled with listeners and not interrupters are the hallmark of successful cultures; the only words allowed: “yes,” “uh-huh,” and “gotcha”—of course, until your turn comes.
• 
. Nobody’s perfect—that’s not merely an aphorism 
engraved it in our minds, but the starting point on your journey to build a successful culture; 
. It’s literal—that’s precisely what 
, Billy Donovan, and even Ray Croc did. It sends a powerful egalitarian signal: 
.
. Don’t just tolerate bad feedback—welcome and accept it.
Sneak-preview future relationships, making small but telling connections between now and a vision of the future.
. You know what Gregg Popovich says at the end of each basketball season? “Thank you for allowing me to coach you.” Thanking ignites cooperative behavior—and is almost 
over the top.
ntering a new group can be stressful 
you make it enjoyable; the latter creates together-moments—and groups;
. It’s a bad idea to give negative feedback wrapped between two positives—it leads to confusion.
The rest of the tips are pretty self-explanatory:
• 
Skill 2 · Share Vulnerability
The reason why the “bad apple” experiment works so well is quite simple: just like most animals, humans are exceptionally good at picking up subtle clues and mirroring other people’s behaviors.
This is the reason why you may sometimes be amazed at some of the actions of your child, wondering “when and how did he/she learn to do that?” It is also the reason why acting as if you know everything when you only know something will create a culture of pseudo-competent employees who’d never dare to share their vulnerabilities.
It works the other way around: when 
, as a leader, are
the one willing to share his vulnerabilities first, then everybody will follow.
The result?
A group of people who know 
 what they know between them, and who are pretty aware both of their failings and their strengths at any moment.
Jeff Polzer calls this mechanism the vulnerability loop: admitting weaknesses results in cooperation because it signals other group members that they can do the same.
And you know who you are comfortable with sharing your weaknesses?
Of course—the people you trust the most.
“Normally,” writes Coyle, “we think about trust and vulnerability the way we think about standing on solid ground and leaping into the unknown: first we build trust, 
 we leap. But science is showing us that we’ve got it backward. Vulnerability doesn’t come after trust—it precedes it. Leaping into the unknown, when done alongside others, causes the solid ground of trust to materialize beneath our feet.”
That’s basically the essence of Kierkegaard’s existential “leap of faith” and the reason why Brené Brown is so adamant that 
.
“Building habits of group vulnerability is like building a muscle,” writes Coyle. “It takes time, repetition, and the willingness to feel pain in order to achieve gains.”
With that in mind, he offers a few workout ideas, both for individuals and for groups:
• 
. The Leader is the one who sets the example: his vulnerability isn’t a weakness, it’s his strength.
Don’t just expect collaboration to happen on its own: send clear signals that it is a prerogative.
. You are obligated to deliver negative feedback face-to-face: not easy, but necessary to create shared clarity and connection.
The moments are the first vulnerability and the first disagreement.
. Or, in other words: nod attentively and gain amplitude by repetition.
. Skilled listeners don’t interrupt to make suggestions or give obvious solutions: resist the temptation.
• 
Learn to endure
emotional pain and a sense of inefficiency.
. Don’t just talk the talk—walk the walk as well.
• 
• 
“It is exactly like traditional mentoring—you pick someone you want to learn from and shadow them—except that instead of months or years, it lasts a few hours.”
. Just like Greg Popovich, leave your team to think on its own and reach a decision independently from time to time. It will.
Skill 3 · Establish Purpose
As Yuval Noah Harari 
, the difference between humans and other animals is not only that we’re smarter, but also that, by being smarter, we are able to share beliefs, even when they are not true.
In his exceptional and wide-ranging book, 
, Mark W. Moffett made an even bolder step, claiming that without shared beliefs, humans would have remained chimpanzees and would have never created societies.
What does that tell us about work culture and teamwork?
Precisely what you would expect it to tell us: 
 are teams and those who don’t are just a collection of distrustful individuals.
And common purposes come pre-packed in narrative arcs: facts may do nothing for us, but stories we like so much that 
Science has recently discovered why it is so: when we listen to facts, our brains are barely active. However, when we listen to stories, they are actively engaged.
Our immediate reaction to a story is one of interest and curiosity: we can’t help ourselves from believing that they have some greater meaning and that some events in the story are causes, and others effects.
Using this to create purpose-driven work culture, however, is not easy: it goes beyond devising a mission statement and a few catchphrases. As Coyle says, “it’s a never-ending process of trying, failing, reflecting, and above all, learning.”
“High-purpose environments don’t descend on groups from on high,” writes Coyle. “they are dug out of the ground, over and over, as a group navigates its problems together and evolves to meet the challenges of a fast-changing world.”
These are his tips to help you do that:
• 
. In order to move toward a target, you must first 
 one. “Most successful groups end up with a small handful of priorities (five or fewer), and many, not coincidentally, end up placing their in-group relationships—how they treat one another—at the top of the list.”
Overcommunicate
your priorities: employees do not see the things as their leaders do.
.
The key is, once again, clarity: by strictly separating these areas, you can tailor your leadership accordingly. Creativity asks for a different leader than proficiency.
. Keep them simple, forthright, and action-oriented, so that they can work as “clear reminders, crisp nudges in the direction the group wants to go.”
. There’s too much noise and endless alternative purposes out there. Create simple universal measures that place focus on what matters to keep you on track.
. Embed your environment with artifacts which embody your purpose and identity.
. Spotlight a small, effortful behavior that transmits, amplifies, and celebrates the purpose of the whole group.
Key Lessons from “The Culture Code”
1.      Successful Groups Feel Safe
2.      Successful Groups Share Their Vulnerabilities and Know Their Real Advantages
3.      Successful Groups Have a Clear and Unchanging Purpose
Successful Groups Feel Safe
The reason why you’d rather spend your time with people you know than with strangers is quite simple: you don’t feel safe in the latter case.
The same is true when it comes to your work environment: if leaders don’t build safety, then it’s every man for himself.
And that’s not a team, but a group of individuals.
Successful Groups Share Their Vulnerabilities and Know Their Real Advantages
A great way to build safety and trust at your workplace is by sharing your weaknesses. 
It may seem counter-intuitive (usually, we share our vulnerabilities only with people who we already trust), but studies have shown that it is actually the other way around: vulnerability breeds trust.
And if you are a leader, make sure that you are the one who is vulnerable first—and often.
Successful Groups Have a Clear and Unchanging Purpose
What unites work groups is the same thing which unites bands, sports teams, religious groups, and even nations: common, shared purpose.
Without it, there’s nothing to work as adhesive tissue, nothing to glue the individuals into a single body.
With it, suddenly, it’s all about

: 
Who Should Read “Company of One”? And Why?
Contrary to what you might deduce from the title, this is not a book about freelancers, nor is it a book about successful small businesses that want to find ways to grow. (If you want that, consult books such as 
).
Counterintuitively, 
 is about businesses that want to 
growing, and people who want to build their work lives around their personal lives—and not the other way around.
If you don’t want to be big, but sustainable, if you don’t want to build a multi-billion industry but work a limited number of hours and spend more time with your friends and family—well, then, Paul Jarvis’ book is the one of the best ones you can find on the market.
Company of One Summary
Apparently, it is not only Ludwig Mies van der Rohe’s followers or 
 who believe sincerely that “less is more.” Counter-intuitively, this is more and more becoming the ethos of many modern businessmen as well!
In 
, Paul Jarvis explains why this shouldn’t surprise nobody—and gives pointers on how you should hop on the “enough is enough” bandwagon as soon as possible!
Defining a Company of One
Put in the simplest terms possible, a company of one is a business that questions growth.
“A company of one,” explains further Jarvis, “resists and questions some forms of traditional growth, not on principle, but because growth isn’t always the most beneficial or financially viable move.”
However, make no mistake: a company of one doesn’t mean a small company per se.
Although a company of one can be a small business owner or a small group of founders, it can also be a set of principles which big business 
 adopt if they “want to keep their brightest minds in their employ.” 
And that is because these “company of one principles” mean self-sufficiency and more autonomy—and that is precisely what most employees, executive leaders, board members, and corporate leaders want today.
“Technically,” concludes Jarvis, “everyone should be a company of one,” because being a company of one means having a mindset to build a business around 
 life, and not the other way around.
Companies of one, according to Jarvis, share four typical traits:
• 
: 
, resilient companies—and since they are companies of one, read: 
— are down-to-earth (they 
 and are not preys to wishful thinking), are 
, and all this because they have 
.
• 
: Being a company of one puts you in control—you are the one who makes the deadlines, and the one who accepts/rejects offers. This gives you more autonomy and control over your own life.
• 
: Companies of one work faster because “they have less of the corporate mass that often gets in the way.”
• 
: Larger companies are more complex; for companies of one, simplicity is mandatory.
Companies of One vs. Small Businesses vs. Freelancing
As one of our school teachers used to say: even better than defining something of its own accord is defining it in relation to a few similar things; that way, you’ll understand it better by seeing what it is 
.
And companies of one are neither small business nor a fancy for freelancer.
The difference between a company of one and a small business—as you’re about to see—is fairly simple: small business like to grow, and companies of one don’t.
Unlike small businesses that stay small merely because they are unable to grow, companies of one are able to grow but stay small by their own choice.
If given an opportunity to grow, a small business would accept it, no questions asked; a real company of one would decline it—because it thinks of growth in much the same manner it thinks of decline.
For small businesses, the definition of success is a variation of the motto “bigger is better;” for companies of one, success means “sustaining a 
 level of income” and nothing more.
That being said, both small business and companies of one invest money to produce something which should return them more money in the future. And that is the big difference between companies of one and freelancers.
For freelancers, the equation “time is money” is quite literal: they earn money only while they work. The moment they stop working, the money stops coming their way. 
Companies of one earn money off of their products, which means that they have a passive income as well.
In short, a freelancer designs a t-shirt and sells the design to her client (one-time transaction). A company of one designs a t-shirt—and sells that designed t-shirt to multiple clients for years to come (passive income).
Staying Small as an End Goal
We know that all this still seems as some anti-capitalistic, utopian pipedream. But it 
 happening as you read this summary—and to prove it, we will go over one of the many examples Jarvis lists in his book.
Psychotactics is a company which provides psychology-related consultancy services to business, and which is run by a certain Sean D’Souza. 
Now, D’Souza doesn’t want to grow his company.
He decided some time ago that $500,000 a year of profit was all he wanted to earn and that his business 
 exceed it. And that’s precisely how much Psychotactics earns (through training workshops and its website).
Counterintuitively to everything you know about business, Sean is 
 interested in reaching his target limit, 
 exceeding it.
Why?
Because he thinks of his business as a corollary to his life and not the other way around. 
Put simply, he started with sketching out the optimal life he wanted to lead (“complete with taking a three-month vacation each year with his wife and spending hours walking, cooking, and teaching and tutoring his two young nieces each day”), and then built his company around this goal.
And when he reached it, he realized something 
 (and something which most business owners never do): 
.
In other words, if you want to earn more money, you’ve got to brace yourself for more problems: more profits mean more customers which means more employees which means more bureaucracy, etc. etc. 
This, of course, means more work time for you, and that defeats the whole purpose of starting a company. After all, what’s the point of earning millions if have no time to spend it on the things you like?
Turn this on its head—and you have a company of one.
Quitting Your Job Is Not the First Step
At this point, you might think the title of this section is some sort of a joke: how would you ever build a successful company of one if you stay stuck in your corporate à-la-
job?
Well, the truth is, of course, you won’t. However, quitting your job should only come 
 you’ve developed something to work with.
Take, for example, Tom Fishburne, the very first guy Paul Jarvis mentions in 
.
He had a great career by all standards, managing to climb the corporate ladder to become the vice president of marketing at a large consumer foods company.
However, he didn’t really like his job: his passion had always been drawing cartoons. In fact, he was kind of successful at this even at Harvard, but since he was part of the SITCOM demographic (Single Income Two Children Oppressive Mortgage), he figured he needed something more stable and took a job in the corporate world.
His friends, fortunately, still liked his cartoons, and since drawing them was Tom’s passion, he didn’t stop sharing them long after taking the job.
These friends of Tom told some friends of theirs, and 
 told some of 
 friends. Eventually, Tom got his first client. When he managed to line up a few of them, in 2010, he quit his job as the VP.
“This turned out to be Tom’s best career move,” writes Jarvis, “both emotionally and, surprisingly, financially.”
So, that’s the first lesson: quit your job only after you’ve already built something to start from.
As Susy Moore noted, a side hustle can change your life.
So, ask yourself, with her: 
?
Passion Is Not Enough—You Need an Audience as Well
To stay with Susie Moore, there’s a catch to the idea of turning your passion into cash. And you might be able to figure it out yourself just by reading the following two paragraphs.
In 2003, as summed up in his article “
,” Robert Vallerand did a wide-ranging study of college students at the University of Quebec. His goal–to find out their passions. 
What he discovered was pretty staggering: most of the students were 
passionate about one of these three things: arts, music, and sports.
Did you realize the catch?
If not, consider this as well: only 3 percent of all jobs can be found in the sports, music, and art industries!
In other words, no matter how passionate you are about these things, chances are you’re never going to become the next Serena Williams, Beyoncé or 
, for the very same reason that a whole class can’t become the next President of the United States.
Simply put, there are too few jobs for too many passionate people.
“Follow your passion,” concludes Jarvis, “is irresponsible business advice.”
What is a responsible one is this: if you want to build a company of one, follow that passion that produces commodities which other people are willing to pay for.
And that sometimes means making compromises.
For example, if you are passionate about drawing, and you believe you’re good at it, then why not follow Paul Jarvis’ path and try a career in web design?
Drawing is not marketable, but web design is. As a web designer, you can find a job straight away, and easily 
 before powering up and evolving into a company of one.
Keywords: Audience, Niche, Retention
As you can realize by now, building a successful company of one is almost always all about being as practical as you can.
Remember: the goal is to build the life you’ve always dreamed about, and not the company you won’t stop working for.
That’s why, investing large sums upfront is not a good idea—start as an intrapreneur, develop your side gig while you earn money from someplace else, and focus on finding a way to make more money as quickly as possible by yourself.
That, of course, starts with finding your audience. 
However, since you’re not aiming high—and don’t want to build a big million-dollar company—you’re freer to find precisely the right people to be your customers.
Think about it this way.
Starbucks started off as a coffee company for one specific type of audience: cool, young people. As the money started pouring in, the company realized that it could scale faster by adding CDs, sandwiches, and fancier drinks to its menu.
The result?
The rapid expansion diluted the Starbucks brand, and before you could say “one coffee to go” please, 900 Starbucks stores off they went.
Starbucks learned the hard way that bigger isn’t always better, and that retaining customers is always much smarter than looking for new ones; because, then, there’s a chance that you might lose the existing ones.
Now, you’re building a company of one: you have the 
of focusing on smaller and more specific target audience.
This brings more trust and more loyalty, and eventually, it means more chance for 
.
And that’s great because if your existing customers bring you enough money, then retaining them is enough to keep you going.
What more could you want?
Key Lessons from “Company of One”
1.      A Company of One Is a Business That Questions Growth
2.      Evolve Your Side Gig into a Company of One (Works If You’re a Freelancer as Well)
3.      Be Passionate—But Practical as Well
A Company of One Is a Business That Questions Growth
In business, growth is, more or less, a by-product of success. However, a company of one doesn’t care much about how things are supposed to work. Or, better, yet—it isn’t interested in following these conventional rules.
“A company of one is simply a business that 
 growth,” writes Paul Jarvis, and goes on to explain that, contrary to traditional knowledge, “growth isn’t always the most beneficial or financially viable move.”
How, you might ask.
Well, it’s simple really: when you’re satisfied with where you’re at (not only with work but also with free time, autonomy, self-sufficiency), just stop there.
More money brings more problems—and you don’t need them. After all, why did you start your company: to earn money, or to live better?
They are not the same.
Evolve Your Side Gig into a Company of One (Works If You’re a Freelancer as Well)
If you’re starting a company of one, don’t quit your job to do so.
Instead, start a side gig while you’re working—something you’re passionate about, something you’re good at, something that will keep your mind off your exhaustive 9-to-5 job.
In time, start using this side gig to earn money. And when you find a few customers—then quit and focus on building a company of one from there.
Be Passionate—But Practical as Well
Even though you might deduce it from our key lesson #2, and even though it’s something you’ll hear every so often nowadays, “follow your passion” is irresponsible business advice. 
Why?
Because not every passion can help you earn money.
If you are like most people and prefer the arts and/or some of the sports over other things, then think again before starting a company of one in one of these spheres: only 3% of all jobs can be found there.
So, be practical: you might never become a professional painter, but a web designer is a good enough compromise, isn’t it?
Especially if it inevitably results in 
 money to buy you 
 time to pursue your hobby in the future.

The kind of information delivered for daily consumption has always been a hot topic for any state.
The US tried to distinguish itself from the rest of the world by introducing the idea of government free press.
Despite all the efforts, it would be inaccurate to claim that they’ve managed to achieve this 100%.
Being at the top is not good enough, and there is more to be done.
Who Should Read “Unfreedom of the Press”? And Why?
Western democracy must meet head-on an increase in censorship and government regulations. The United States of America, a name that echoes liberty and individual responsibility, has been ridiculed by a collective-driven mob.
“
” intends to unravel the reasons behind this surge of bias and ideologically possessed journalism.
With this in mind, I believe that this book is suited for anyone living in Western countries, as it will help them understand what is at stake. 
About Mark R. Levin
Apart from being an author, 
 is a lawyer, radio personality and former chief of staff for Attorney General Edwin Meese. 
After winning the Republican Nomination, Mark became a Pro-Trump supporter and a fierce critic of the 
 in US elections.
“Unfreedom of the Press PDF Summary”
The book title in itself reveals the main topic that troubles many people in the new age of digital monitoring. 
The US, having the most influence in today’s politics, is hit by a wave of authoritarianism, often disguised as progressivism.
The pseudo-intellectuals supported by the “progressive” left, sit at the center of this debate, and act as partisans to the Democratic Party.
What is most surprising, not only to Americans but also to people who visit the US is the hostility propelled by the journalists, which is aimed at America’s founding principles of democracy, integrity, and freedom.
It seems like the concept of freedom is slowly fading away, and more authoritative political fractions are coming to light.
Even though it is the media’s job to condemn these acts of tyranny, the so-called “unbiased” journalists, set on a different campaign that has an agenda attached to it.
One might make the argument that the genuine bedrock of democracy is the freedom of the press, and yet it is the government that has the final say.
The media is unable to enact policies which will keep the government out, or perhaps they don’t want to. They blatantly cater to big corporations and advocate for big government that is in direct confrontation with America’s founding principles.
Let’s unpack the focal point of this discussion by asking a couple of questions.
To understand the overly polarized America, you have to be aware of the fact that only 21% of Republicans trust the media, while 80% of Democrats feel the same way.
Trump’s attacks on big News Networks has increased since he has been in the office, because he feels the media portrays his administration as inept and racist, at every opportunity.
Lara Logan (CBS News journalist and war correspondent) called out a handful of journalists who have abandoned the concept of reporting facts and are merely pushing a political agenda. 
A prodigious amount of research has been done by the nonpartisan Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media on the issue of news coverage during and after the elections. When it comes to Donald Trump, he received negative critics by a ratio of 13-1, while Fox is the only news outlet that didn’t chastise him on an occasional basis. 
Trump lashes out at the mainstream news networks such as CBS, CNN, NBC, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post for this level of bias against him.
On Fox News, 52% of all stories reported about Trump had a negative mark, while 48% had a clear positive tone.
It might seem shocking to you, but the so-called “unbiased” networks often portray Fox News as incompetent, highly unprofessional, and extremely biased. They even go as far as outright banning certain shows and hosts in an attempt to destroy their reputation.
By comparison, former US President, Barack Obama enjoyed far more positive media coverage in the first 100 days of his presidency than any of its predecessors.
It is estimated that approximately 40% of all news stories related to Barack Obama had a positive tone, compared to 22% for President George W. Bush and 27% for Bill Clinton.
But, 
 in order to understand how the press has evolved.
In the late 18
 century, years following the declaration of independence, the United States entered a party-press era.
It was a time when newspapers openly aligned to a political party, an organization or a politician. If you consider that undemocratic, wait until you hear what is going on now.
On January 18
, 2018, Andrew Malcolm summed up political journalism in the United States as anti-Trump – a statement that only further divided the country.
The targeted media outlets deny the existence of bias against the 45
 President of the USA by simply referring to their negative reports as being realistic and comprehensive. 
Unfortunately, nobody could find the same level of criticism aimed at the presidency of Obama, while he was in office. Literally, no journalist has called out Barack Obama on his infamous statements that Al Qaeda was on the run, that the Russians are not a strategic threat, that his administration hasn’t experienced a 
 during his time at the White House, etc.
It seems as if any person out there willing to denounce, condemn, or chastise President Trump is immediately given a platform to spread information, often coupled with inaccuracies.
Impeachment is another hot topic in 2018 and 2019. The press took the bait and reacted in the same way Democrat Senators, politicians, and officials did. 
You can also see a carefully selected list of guests and people that portray themselves as “experts” in the mattering question. 
You don’t even need anything other than to turn on the TV and lay witness to the orchestrated attack on Trump, as he is labeled a racist, Nazi, among other things. The so-called geopolitical pundits, news anchors, and others have openly put him in the same category as Stalin, Mao, and Hitler. 
Being associated with the biggest mass murderers in history that wiped out more than 130 million people from the face of this planet, is unspeakably offensive to the families who have been on the receiving end of these executions in the past century.
Even though this kind of revelation will give goosebumps to a normal person, the media outrage and the hysterical outcry on the left increases as the 2020 Presidential Elections loom.
So, it gets pretty clear that the term “Freedom of the Press” has become corrupt to its very core.
When someone is talking about it, the usual reaction revolves around the concept of keeping Government control out of what people consume on a daily basis, and make their own arguments.
But, today’s media asserts that Trump labeling them as “The enemy of the people” or “Fake News” is not only a menace to the Freedom of the Press but also a direct attack on the First Amendment.
The question is? Has Trump advocated for a state-run media?
Does the media support his policies? Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you know that the answer is almost always “NO” with capital letters.
If you take for example cable channels, (CNN, Fox News, MSNBC) you’ll find that Obama hovered around 3-5% airtime throughout his presidency, while the number for Trump up to this point varies between 13-17%. 
On top of that, you can add that the coverage during his first 100 days of his presidency was overwhelmingly negative. This shows why 51% of Republicans believe that today’s media is rightfully labeled as “The enemy of the people.”
To better illustrate this, Mark R. Levin recounts on the policies implemented and enacted by the 28
 President of the United States Woodrow Wilson, and the 32
 Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
During WW1, President Woodrow Wilson revamped the Espionage Act and imprisoned hundreds of Americans who opposed the war. He restricted the Freedom of the Press, and basically threatened one of the main pillars of US democracy.
In the case of Franklin D. Roosevelt, he was able to find common grounds with the media and the correspondents. Of course, there were some problems, like threats and pressure, but the media is indebted to Roosevelt and his administration for many things that are related to the idea of freedom of the press.
The same accomplishments can also be attributed to Barrack Obama for being able to maintain this relatively open relationship with the Press. 
But many wonder – why Donald Trump is smeared by the media, and will that be a reason enough for imposing restrictions on the 
. The answer is, “No.”
There are no orders, executives, nor acts signed or enacted by Donald Trump’s administration that will ultimately lead to Curtailment of the First Amendment. 
However, you cannot help but notice that there is all-out warfare between Trump and certain media outlets. Obviously, those leaning on the left.
Mark R. Levin also criticizes the New York Times, because of the way they are handling the process of conveying information and how often they put the journalist’s personal point of view on the pedestal. As a journalist, you should start with a fact, statistic or something that upholds your claim, and move on from there.
Is there an upheaval in sight? Probably not, as this whole hysteria regarding Trump is dividing the country.
Key Lessons from “Unfreedom of the Press”
1.      Check your story
2.      Ratings are falling, so is TV Consumption
3.      Verify first, and report facts
Check your story
From the “Hands up don’t Shoot” narrative to the Covington MAGA Kids, various news outlets simply jump on a story without double checking the source.
They have an agenda, in which there has to be a perfect villain and a perfect victim.
Their whole game is too obvious that almost no one believes them anymore.
Ratings are falling, so is TV Consumption
Apparently, YouTube has become a fierce competitor that enables various independent video-makers to create content and report on anything without the strings of having ultra-modern equipment in a fancy building.
Although YouTube has recently commenced a purge against conservative voices on its platform, it still poses the biggest threat to traditional TV broadcasting channels.
The bottom line is, if traditional TV Channels don’t stop with the false narratives, people are going to look for a better solution.
Verify first, and report facts
The highest standard of journalism revolves around the idea of being willing to cover a story even if it doesn’t fit your political or personal views.
How many more times do we have to witness bad news coverage, that only further divides the country on the basis of their skin, religion, or ethnicity?
Let’s see if anything changes.

“Unfreedom of the Press Quotes”
Our Critical Review
In the dire periods before the American Revolution, the press was on tenterhooks, pushing and promoting the idea of a Free State. 
The Union was founded on the ideals of liberty, private property, free speech, and transparency. The forefathers built a nation whose roots are embedded into the concept of liberty, and freedom of the press, but it seems that we are losing ground.
The progressive movement of the past century had eyes for accurate and objectivity-driven reporting. 
Nonetheless, it is evident that we still struggle to create this Independent News Network, and it seems that ideologically driven journalists have all the power in today’s society."

Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there were queens mightier than kings.
And Kara Cooney wants to talk to you about six of them, each of which left a lasting mark on Ancient Egypt.
Learn all about them in our summary of her book:
Who Should Read “When Women Ruled the World”? And Why?
If you are interested in history—especially in pharaohs and Ancient Egypt—then you should definitely have a look at 
 
But read it if you want to understand why women don’t rule the world at present, and why they should in the future: besides being a historical study, Kara Cooney’s 
 reads like a feminist manifesto as well, one mostly based on empirical data taken from the mother of all knowledge—history.

“When Women Ruled the World PDF Summary”
To speak of women ruling the world nowadays seems a bit unreal. Maybe that’s why Kara Cooney begins her book on the most famous Egypt’s queens with a very telling fairytale stock phrase:
Now, make no mistakes: if it sounds too good to be true, that is because it is. Even Egypt, “the only state that consistently allowed female rule,” was, in the long run, “no less cruel and oppressive to women than every other complex society on Earth.” 
It too had merely a few female rulers, and “suffered a woman leader only when it had to, expunging her from the eyes of her people as soon as possible.”
What does that mean?
It means that a woman could become a king only if the male king was too old or too young to rule—or, perhaps, hadn’t been born yet. It also means that no matter what these queens did, the pharaohs that came after them, consistently “erased or omitted their names from the formal ‘king lists’ of monarchs created by the royal temple.”
So, in short: the power was freely given to them because Egypt needed them. When it didn’t need them anymore, it acted as if these women never ruled.
In 
 
, Kara Cooney tries to change this, so that we can better understand “this strange and contradictory tale of unadulterated female power wielded by poorly remembered women over an extraordinary 3,000-year run of ups and downs.”
So, let’s turn to the women themselves.
Merneith: Queen of Blood
Merneith was not only one of the first female rulers of Egypt—she was one of the first rulers of Egypt, period.
She ruled during Dynasty 1 (3000–2890 B.C.), at the very dawn of the Egyptian nation-state, when (as Cooney says) “kingship was new and brutal.” 
When her father, the revered King Djer died, her brother Djet inherited the throne from him. Soon after, he asked Merneith to be his wife and, expectedly, she agreed. No need to reread the previous sentence: Merneith was now, indeed, both the sister and the chosen wife of the new pharaoh.
King Djet unexpectedly died only a few years in his reign, and his son with Merneith, Den, was too young to rule—so Merneith became the ruler instead. 
Her first duty?
To properly prepare the burial for her husband and brother.
She did her best: per the ceremonial practices (which asked for sacrifices), she killed hundreds of people, most of them half-brothers of Den. The reason is apparent: she wanted to make sure that when Den becomes a Pharaoh, not one of his power-hungry relatives would be able to challenge his rule.
Though she never officially became the sovereign, Merneith ruled for Den for six or seven years and, when she died, she was honored with a king’s burial: 120 close relatives of her lie buried next to her in the royal necropolis of Abydos.
Neferusobek: The Last Woman Standing
Eleven dynasties after Merneith, Neferusobek (or Sobekneferu) of Dynasty 12 (1985–1773 B.C.) became the first female Pharaoh of which we have undeniable proof.
She was the daughter of Amenemhat III, a powerful ruler whose reign is deemed the golden age of the Middle Egyptian Kingdom. Additionally, just like Merneith, Neferusobek was also the wife of her brother, in her case, Amenemhat IV.
Unfortunately, due to this tradition of incestuous relationships, Amenemhat IV was sterile, so he didn’t leave a male heir after his death. That’s how Neferusobek, the last ruler of the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt, assumed the throne.
She remained there for no more than four years, a period during which she completed the construction of a temple complex in Hawara and added places of worship in structures at Heracleopolis Magna. 
She died a mysterious death but was not forgotten: she was preserved in most of the king lists, honored for protecting the land in a time of distress.
Hatshepsut: Queen of Public Relations
The second historically-confirmed female pharaoh came to power four centuries after Neferusobek. 
Her name was Hatshepsut (of Dynasty 18, 1550–1295 B.C.) and she was “the only woman to have ever taken power as king in ancient Egypt during a time of prosperity and expansion.”
That was not the only rule Hatshepsut broke.
Appointed to the office of High Priestess by her father Thutmose I as a young girl, Hatshepsut became the wife of her brother, Thutmose II, soon after he inherited the throne. Thutmose II accomplished absolutely nothing during his short reign and was supposed to be succeeded by a son born of his harem.
At the time of Thutmose II’s death, the boy, Thutmose III, was just a toddler, so his mother was supposed to act as pharaoh regnant. However, she (her name was Iset) was incapacitated, so Hatshepsut was assigned to the role. And she remained there a long, long time—22 years to be exact.
She seems to have been a very smart queen, doling out riches and titles to the men around her to appease them. She also built majestic religious buildings, such as the Temple of Millions of Years at Thebes, and a powerful Red Sea fleet which, in turn, made famous trading expeditions around Africa. 
She went personally on the most well-known among these, the one to the Land of Punt, a semimythical place dubbed “the Land of God” by Ancient Egyptians. When she returned from this daring expedition with priceless aromas and spices, Hatshepsut was rewarded with the respect of her people.
Like her father, Hatshepsut also organized military expeditions and expanded Egypt’s borders to Nubia and Kush. She also raised a great king: the empire of Thutmose III would become the largest Egypt would ever see.
Unfortunately, Thutmose III was a bit ungrateful and destroyed every memory of his stepmother once he became the pharaoh. In Cooney’s words, 
Nefertiti: More Than Just a Pretty Face
A century after Hatshepsut, Nefertiti, also of Dynasty 18, became the wife of Amenhotep IV, perhaps the instigator of the first monotheistic religious revolution in history.
In the fifth year of his reign, Amenhotep ordered a sed festival, even though this was a privilege only for the pharaohs who retained the throne for three decades. It was even stranger when he dedicated it to the sun god Aten, a minor god in Egypt’s polytheistic pantheon.
Little did the Egyptian elites knew that this was merely the beginning: soon after, Amenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaten (“The One Who Is Beneficial to the Aten”), and, before too long, he started destroying old temples and building new ones (all of them dedicated to the sun god), going so far to even order the erection of a new capital, Amarna.
Akhenaten seemed to have loved Nefertiti a lot—who wouldn’t have—which is why “The Great King’s Wife” had all the freedom she wanted. It is quite possible that she used it to reinvent herself, in the twelfth year of her husband’s rule, as Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten, his co-king.
She ruled with him during the next five years and, after his death, she may have reinvented herself yet again as Ankhkheperure Smenkhkare, the pharaoh who came next in line and who ruled before the boy-king Tutankhamun.
Egyptologists are not sure whether Ankhkheperure Smenkhkare was Nefertiti, but many think so. If that is the case, she successfully guided Egypt on a path to recovery after a period of great turmoil.
“Nefertiti is remembered to us as a great beauty, a chiseled face of loveliness and sensual desire,” writes Kara Cooney. “But she may have been much more if recent investigations are correct.”
Tawosret: The Survivor
During Dynasty 19 (1295–1186 B.C.), another woman named Tawosret became pharaoh. But she did so in a way none of her female predecessors did: “through her husband, an unrelated royal heir, and brutal civil unrest.”
Tawosret was the wife of Seti II, who was supposed to be the pharaoh of Egypt when he sat on the throne around 1200. However, at the same time, another man named Amunmesses (or Amenmesse), possibly his half-brother, seized control over Nubia and Thebes and announced his claim to the throne. 
Seti II emerged victorious from the power battle which followed but unexpectedly died after trying to consolidate power in Thebes via Chancellor Bay. Bay installed a new king, a 14-year-old boy named Siptah, a guy too young and sickly (he had cerebral palsy) to rule at the time. So, he was placed under the guidance of Tawosret, the queen regent (and possibly his stepmother).
And this is where things got messy: Bay expected for Siptah to die soon (and, true, he died at 16) and to assume power himself. Tawosret had a plan of her own: she killed Bay and became the first female pharaoh to rule unaccompanied by father or husband or son.
She was killed by a warlord named Setnakht only two years after she became the sovereign. Just like Neferusobek, Tawosret was also the last ruler of her Dynasty.
“Her tomb in the Valley of the Kings,” informs us Cooney, “shows her as a female king, but that sepulcher would be taken over by the very same man who had her violently removed from power.”
Cleopatra: Drama Queen
During the millennium or so after Taworset, female power lay dormant in Egypt as parts of the country were repeatedly conquered by foreign powers. Unsurprisingly, Egypt’s last queen—and the most famous of the lot—was actually a foreigner: Cleopatra VII, member of a Macedonian Greek ruling family (the Ptolemaic Dynasty which came after 
 and lasted from 305 B.C. to 30 B.C.). 
When she was 14 years old, Cleopatra was named co-ruler of Egypt by Ptolemy XII, her father, who named his son Ptolemy XIII as his successor. However, Cleopatra’s brother wanted to rule Egypt all by himself, so he exiled Cleopatra to Syria.
Unfortunately for him, he allied himself with the wrong person, the Roman general Pompey who lost the Civil War in Rome to Julius Caesar. Cleopatra used the situation to charm Caesar and ask from him to force her brother to reinstate her as a co-ruler. 
Ptolemy XIII refused, much to his misfortune, because that caused his demise: united, Cleopatra and Caesar won the war against Ptolemy, and Cleopatra became co-ruler with her younger brother, Ptolemy XIV.
As it is well known, Caesar’s weakness for Cleopatra resulted in Cleopatra’s first child, Caesarion, but also in her lover’s assassination. Cleopatra acted quickly: she poisoned her brother and positioned Caesarion as co-ruler in his place.
Moreover, she also started yet another affair, with one of Caesar’s former allies, Mark Anthony. She bore him children as well, and for a while, the institution of a Roman-Egyptian dynasty looked all but inevitable.
However, the feeling wasn’t shared by the powerful Roman elites, who, under the command of Octavian August, started a war against Marc Anthony and Cleopatra.
The final result?
When it was evident that the war—and, as Byron would say, “the ancient world”—was irretrievably lost, Anthony stabbed himself, Cleopatra poisoned herself in a bathtub, and Caesarion was killed by the Romans, taking her younger children hostage.
That marked not only the end of Cleopatra but, in a way, of Egypt’s glory as well.
Key Lessons from “When Women Ruled the World”
1.      Divine Kingship: Egypt’s Political System 
2.      The Stories of Egypt’s Female Pharaohs
3.      Why Women Don’t—And Should—Rule the World
Divine Kingship: Egypt’s Political System 
In Egyptian mythology, the primeval king of Egypt, the god Osiris, passes his title on his son, Horus. Nothing strange—that’s how it is in almost all human cultures. A father-king transfers his power to his son whose duty is to produce a male offspring so that the country can be indefinitely ruled by powerful men.
However, Egypt was an exception to this rule, possibly because they worshipped almost as much as Osiris his wife and sister, Isis, “the alpha and omega of Egyptian kingship.” Queen and lover, nurturer and mother, Isis was the reason why, from time to time, women got to become pharaohs as well.
And we’re not stretching the truth here at all: since all of Egypt’s rulers, according to its unique system of power called divine kingship, were representatives of gods on earth, women-pharaohs 
 to be adored by everybody as much as men-pharaohs. After all, they were practically goddesses.
The Stories of Egypt’s Female Pharaohs
However, it is essential to note that, even though Ancient Egypt is the only country which consistently allowed for women to become as powerful as men, it was still ostensibly a patriarchal and authoritarian society. 
More or less, women could only become pharaohs when the designated king was either too young or too old to rule—or when he was not even born.
Be that as it may, the six women whose stories are told by Kara Cooney in 
Merneith, Neferusobek, Hatshepsut, Nefertiti, Tawosret, and Cleopatra—did manage to become the most powerful person in Egypt (all in their own times), and five of them served as king outright.
Why do we know so little of them today?
Because the men who came to rule Egypt after them erased their names from the formal ‘king lists’ of monarchs created by the royal temple.
You’d think that something like that doesn’t happen today—but it does. Think of Janet Reno or Janet Yellen. Just recently two of the most powerful people in the United States, both of them are practically forgotten by today. 
Why Women Don’t—And Should—Rule the World
“The Egyptians,” writes Cooney, “were light-years ahead of us in their trust of female power… We may be a 50/50 society in terms of gender, yet women do not hold 50 percent of the power.”
“Whether we want to admit it or not,” she goes on, “voting a woman into office makes most Americans feel uncomfortable, even threatened, because she appears more strident and shrill and bossy than her male counterpart, according to countless sociological studies.”
In other words, women don’t rule the world because we distrust them much more than their male counterparts. 
 uncovers that this was not always the case. On the contrary, in fact: Ancient Egypt fostered female ambition, and, that way, it was able to raise queens it was (at least for a short time) proud of.
With this in mind, Cooney is able to conclude:

Want to learn more about the life and philosophy Dalai Lama?
Here’s one of the best books to do so:
Who Should Read “My Spiritual Journey”? And Why?
The 14
 Dalai Lama—aka Tenzin Gyatso—has authored or co-authored almost a hundred books, but 
is one of the best-structured ones if you want to learn more about him and his worldview.
No wonder it was originally 
, which is French for 
. Though indisputably unconventional one, at times it does read like that—and is certainly the closest thing you can find on the market to an autobiography of Dalai Lama.
Kudos to Sofia Stril-Rever—a renowned Sanskrit expert and an interpreter for the Dalai Lama for more than a decade and a half—who managed to compile the book, and provide it with sometimes much necessary footnotes and annotations.
About Dalai Lama
 is the title Tibetans give to their foremost spiritual leaders. The current one is the last in a line of fourteen Dalai Lamas, and his religious name is Tenzin Gyatso.
Enthroned as the Dalai Lama in 1940, and assuming political duties a decade later (at the tender age of 15), Tenzin Gyatso is consensually considered one of the spiritual leaders of the world.
Consulted on various questions, the Dalai Lama has authored and co-authored many books, most of which are translated into several languages. Among them are 
and 
, the latter one co-authored with Desmond Tutu.
For his dedication to the cause of Tibet and his belief in nonviolence as the only path to a better future for humanity, the current Dalai Lama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 and was dubbed one of the “Children of Mahatma Gandhi” by 
magazine.
“My Spiritual Journey PDF Summary”
When it first appeared in French, the original title of 
 was 
. It was only for the English edition that the book got another title, one which tries to acknowledge the enormous contribution of Dalai Lama’s translator and the compiler of this book, Sofia Stril-Rever.
The clarification, however—as the editor of the English edition says—”should in no way be perceived as anything but an authentication of these inspiring stories, lessons, and spiritual truths as the Dalai Lama’s own, and an accurate and approved presentation of his spiritual journey through a most remarkable life.”
Dalai Lama’s Three Commitments in Life
consists of three parts, each of which chronicles the Dalai Lama’s spiritual journey in one of three ways: as a human being, as a Buddhist monk, and as the Dalai Lama.
The book is framed the way it is because of the impact a speech of the Dalai Lama had Sofia Stril-Rever. The speech was originally delivered by the Dalai Lama to the European Parliament in Brussels, on December 4, 2008, and it is reprinted in the book as more than just a suitable afterword. 
We’ll summarize it here first because it seems like the best way to start the summary. In the speech, the Dalai Lama lists the three commitments in his life.
Dalai Lama’s first commitment, as a human being, is “the promotion of human values and those qualities of spirit that are key elements in a happy life, whether of an individual, a family, or a community.” 
According to him, these days, very few people seem to cultivate these values and qualities—which is why he thinks it is his priority to advocate them.
Dalai Lama’s second commitment, now as a Buddhist monk, is “the promotion of harmony among the different religions.” At first, this may sound a bit strange, because, let’s face it, the objective of most religions is to prove that theirs is the only valid one.
The Dalai Lama, fortunately, is one who understands the concept of 
 and, moreover, one who has a real understanding of the difference between being religious and being spiritual (as we explained above).
Nobody would ever doubt the necessity of pluralism in political life—that is the essence of democracy, isn’t it?—and yet, people are not that confident when it’s a matter of diversity of beliefs and religions. 
Well, the Dalai Lama can’t see the logic behind this, especially in view of the fact that “all the chief religious traditions bring us the same message of love, compassion, tolerance, temperance, and self-discipline.”
Almost expectedly, Dalai Lama’s third commitment—as the Dalai Lama—is the cause of Tibet. 
People often forget that, despite being one of the spiritual leaders of the world, he is also a political leader of a country. Moreover, a country which is basically occupied by one of the two superpowers, China.
The Dalai Lama is in exile ever since 1959—he lives in India—but he has never forgotten the well-being of his people.
He is aware that unlike his first two commitments (which depend solely on his will and discipline), the third one will only come to an end when a mutually satisfying solution is found between the Tibetans and the Chinese.
It’s sad to say this, but it seems like the Dalai Lama has given up hope that this will happen in his lifetime.
Part One: As a Human Being
The first part of 
 encompasses two chapters: “Our Common Humanity” and “My Lives Without Beginning or End.” In them, the Dalai Lama explains not only his childhood and upbringing in Lhasa but also his philosophy and worldview.
The basis of Dalai Lama’s personal beliefs is quite simple:
This is something the Dalai Lama believes quite unwaveringly. As he sees it, his title “Dalai Lama” is just a responsibility that has come down to him, and nothing else. At his basis, he is just a normal human being—it just so happens that he is also a Buddhist and a Tibetan.
This view, of course, has far-reaching consequences.
For one, it blows in the face of 
. Unlike most ideologists of today, the Dalai Lama doesn’t think that “the meaning of life” is a question that can be answered on an individual basis.
He is quite confident in the opposite, in fact.
“Our life depends on others so much,” he writes, “that at the root of our existence there is a fundamental need for love. That is why it is good to cultivate an authentic sense of our responsibility and a sincere concern for the welfare of others.”
In other words, if all human beings long for love, how can we expect that glorifying individualism can prepare the way for a better, happier twenty-first century?
It is only through the acknowledgment that we are all alike and that each of us has a need for the other that we can really put back the capital H at the beginning of the word “humanity.”
This acknowledgment has a name.
It is compassion:
The Dalai Lama thinks of himself as “a devoted servant of compassion”: he says that nothing gives him more satisfaction that the practice of empathy and kindness. 
When he left Tibet, he often says, he left all his wealth and material belongings behind him. But in his heart, he did manage to take with him something priceless: infinite compassion.
Another thing he didn’t forget to take with him: contagious laughter. He says that he smiles all the time and that he has always tried to laugh away the worries and anxieties. 
How does he have the strength?
Well, to quote him, he says that he is “a professional laugher.” And we don’t even know if he’s joking or not!
Part Two: As a Buddhist Monk
In the second part of the book—consisting of three chapters (“Transforming Oneself,” “Transforming the World,” and “Taking Care of the World”), the Dalai Lama explores his experiences as a Buddhist monk.
He introduces us to his ideal, that of the Bodhisattva, and talks about the necessity of pluralism when it comes to religion. 
One part that really struck a chord with us was the Dalai Lama’s attempt to differentiate between religion and spirituality: 
This is why, the Dalai Lama calls for a spiritual and ethical revolution, one that will blur the lines between 
 and 
and transform the world in our lifetimes.
He, once again, points the finger in the direction of the Western societies, which, though amazing in their energy, creativity, and hunger for knowledge, are disregarding interdependence as a fact of both nature and life.
“Even the smallest insects,” the Dalai Lama says, “are social beings who, without the slightest religion, law, or education, survive thanks to mutual cooperation, based on an innate recognition of their interrelatedness.”
And if “the myriad forms of life, as well as the subtlest levels of material phenomena, are governed by interdependence,” then why should humans be any different?
Buddha discovered this millennia ago; and, for some reason, we still refuse to take note.
Part Three: As the Dalai Lama
The last section of 
is, expectedly, the most political one.
It relays, in two chapters (“In 1959 the Dalai Lama Meets the World” and “I Appeal to All the Peoples of the World”) his story as the political leader of a stateless nation.
We learn how the Dalai Lama became the temporal leader of Tibet at the age of 16, and how, from that moment on, he became the target of Chinese interest.
Just one year before the Dalai Lama assumed full political duties, Mao Tse-tung had proclaimed the birth of the People’s Republic of China, and very soon made known his intention to “liberate” Tibet.
On October 7, 1950, 40,000 men from the People’s Liberation Army of China crossed the river Yangtze (the eastern border between Tibet and China) and entered the country of the Dalai Lama
 8,500 Tibetan soldiers could do nothing: the Chinese troops stopped just a little short of Tibet’s capital, Lhasa, and asked the Tibetan government to send a delegation to Beijing to negotiate the condition of the “peaceful liberation.”
The next year, a Seventeen Point Agreement was reached which affirmed Chinese sovereignty over Tibet. But on March 10, 1959, a revolt erupted in Lhasa, which was put down by the Chinese with the cost of much bloodshed.
Dalai Lama’s life was in danger, but thousands of Tibetans spontaneously created a wall with their bodies around his summer residence and didn’t disperse for a week. Eventually, most of them were killed by the Chinese Red Army.
But by then, masked as an ordinary soldier, the Dalai Lama had fled Tibet under the protection of the Freedom Fighters. 
He settled in India, from where he is still loud in his support for Tibet, appealing to the people of the world for help.
“I Place My Hope in the Human Heart”
“In spite of the atrocious crimes the Chinese have committed in our country,” writes the Dalai Lama in the paragraphs chosen by Stril-Rever to serve as a sort of conclusion, “I have absolutely no hatred in my heart for the Chinese people.”
Why?
Because, as the Dalai Lama says a little below this sentence, he believes that one of the greatest dangers of the present age is “to blame nations for the crimes of individuals.”
That does a disservice to everyone!
Just think about that!
Whenever you say something along the lines “The French suck” or “Americans are bad,” you are insulting many admirable French and American citizens. The Dalai Lama says that: he knows many admirable Chinese as well, and it’s wrong to blame the Chinese for his misfortunes and the misfortunes of his people.
It’s not even a matter of “good people vs. bad people;” it’s merely a matter of people who have hope and are sources of it and people who don’t have hope and diminish other people’s hope. The latter ones are the ones that make the mistakes.
Don’t be one of them: “Be a source of hope,” says the Dalai Lama.
That’s precisely what he said to Ron Whitehead, an American poet, in few sentences which the latter turned into a poem.
“Whatever happens,” its verses say, “never lose hope!… Be a source of compassion, not just for your friends, but for everyone. And whatever happens, whatever happens around you—never lose hope!”
These three words (the refrain of the poem) became a slogan taken up by the Tibetan youth. Nowadays, you can find them on Tibetan T-shirts and inscribed on houses in children’s villages.
Find them in your heart as well.
Key Lessons from “My Spiritual Journey”
1.      Only Compassion Has the Power to Save Humanity
2.      Eliminate These Three Mental Poisons to Become a Better Person
3.      Dalai Lama’s Three Commitments in Life
Only Compassion Has the Power to Save Humanity
According to the Dalai Lama, in the most profound way imaginable, we are all the same—even if reality incessantly attempts to demonstrate the opposite.
It is from here that the most beautiful human trait must arise: compassion. Nothing is as powerful as it. Compassion is born the moment you realize that everyone on this planet—including the people you hate—want to be happy, and none of us ever wants to suffer.
Remind yourself that as often as you can and the world will be a better place. 
Eliminate These Three Mental Poisons to Become a Better Person
According to Buddhist philosophy, there are three mental poisons you should be aware of: ignorance, desire, and hatred.
Every time your mind is stung by either one of them, your body starts functioning in ways contrary to those that helped humans live in societies and made them by far the most developed species in the history of the universe.
You need to be mindful of these three poisons: just identifying them is enough to prevent them from taking hold of your mind and body.
So, every time you realize that you don’t know or desire something, or that you hate someone, stop for a second, put that down on paper, and think it through.
Would you like to live in a world ruled by ignorance and hate, a world where instead of wanting to 
 more, people want to 
 more?
We neither.
Dalai Lama’s Three Commitments in Life
As a human being, the Dalai Lama is committed to the idea of promoting human values.
As a Buddhist monk, he is interested in promoting harmony between different religions.
Finally, as the 14
 Dalai Lama, he wants to see Tibet free.
These are the Dalai Lama’s three commitments in life—and he intends to maintain them until his final breath.

The Watergate Scandal: The Affair That Brought President Nixon’s Administration to Its Knees,https://blog.12min.com/watergate-scandal-summary/,https://blog.12min.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image4-1024x628.png,"12 min read ⌚ 
In a letter sent to Bishop Mandell Creighton on April 5, 1887, Lord Acton famously quipped the following: “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men.”
Populated with more Hitlers and Stalins than you can imagine, the twentieth century proved Lord Acton’s concerns more than just reasonable—it proved them right. During the 1970s, Acton’s prophetic words echoed all around the leading democratic country in the world as well, the USA.
Demonstrating the extent to which power can be abused, the Watergate scandal changed American politics forever, leading to a still-felt surge of distrust toward the government and the presidential position. 
And this is how it unfolded.
Watergate Scandal Summary
June–November 1972: Something Is Rotten in the State of America
On June 17, 1972, five men—
, and
—attempt to break in to the HQ of the Democratic National Committee located about a mile from the White House, at the Watergate Complex.
A security guard notices some tape on a door latch, and suspecting foul play, calls the police. They arrive just on time to catch the five men red-handed. 
, White House press secretary, describes the incident as a “third-rate burglary.” 
Immediately after the break-in, 
sends one of its young crime reporters, 
, to investigate the story. Another young reporter by the name of 
 joins in, volunteering to make some phone calls.
Three days later, Bob Woodward has the first of his meetings with arguably the most famous informant in journalist history: 
.
publishes the first in a series of articles written by Woodward and Bernstein. 
Titled “
,” the article reveals that a $25,000 cashier’s check, earmarked for the Nixon campaign, has somehow wound up in the bank account of one of the Watergate burglars.
Suspicions arise as to whether the Watergate break-in was just a usual burglary, but President Richard Nixon denies any such thing:
Aside, however, he tells, 
, an attorney and consultant of his, to find ways to cover up the White House’s connection to the break-in.
On August 30, 1972, Nixon announces that Dean’s internal investigation has found no evidence of White House involvement in the break-in.
After publishing a few more stories related to the Watergate Scandal (amid threats coming from the White House), on October 10, 1972, 
 prints another article by Woodward and Bernstein, titled “
.”
Its opening two paragraphs make startling allegations:
Very few people believe Woodward and Bernstein, with many doubting the credibility of their source, Deep Throat.
In fact, unlike 
,
most of the media at the time concentrate on reporting related to the 1972 presidential election, where Richard Nixon is predicted to win.
Richard Nixon wins the 1972 US presidential election by a landslide, taking 60% of the popular vote and winning 49 states; Washington D.C. is the only one won by his opponent, George McGovern, Democratic Senator of South Dakota.
Receiving almost 18 million votes more than McGovern, Nixon holds the record for the widest popular vote margin in US presidential election history to this day.
June 1971–June 1972: Flashbacks of a CREEP
Four years before his reelection, almost to the day, Richard Nixon defeats the Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey in one of the closest elections in U.S. history.
At Richard Nixon’s order, 
 and his staff (including Deputy Assistant 
) work with the US Secret Service to install a secret taping system which records all conversation in the Oval Office and the Cabinet Room.
Three months later, microphones are added to Nixon’s private office in the Old Executive Office Building. The following year microphones are installed in the presidential lodge at Camp David as well.
On June 13, 1971, 
 begins publishing the Pentagon Papers.
Officially titled “Report of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Vietnam Task Force,” the papers are released by 
, US military analyst, and chronicle America’s secret history of the Vietnam War.
The Papers demonstrate that the Johnson administration had systematically and thoroughly lied to both the public and the Congress.
A week after the Pentagon Papers are released, the White House establishes a “Special Investigation Unit”—more colloquially known as the 
—whose sole task is to stop or quickly respond to the leaking of classified information such as the ones disclosed by Ellsberg.
The unuttered—but key—phrase is: “by any means necessary.”
True to this dictum, on September 3, 1971, the White House Plumbers burglarize Daniel Ellsberg’s psychiatrist’s office in an attempt to dig up compromising info on the military analyst, with an obvious objective to discredit him later.
At the beginning of 1971, the Committee for the Re-Election of the President is established. 
Its members include some of the White House Plumbers (such as 
 and 
), in addition to some new faces such as 
, the Campaign Director, 
,
, and others.
Though abbreviated as CRP, the Committee would later come to be derisively known as CREEP due to its involvement in the Watergate Scandal and the use of numerous dirty tricks in the campaign.
On February 24, 1972, a letter reaches the editor of the 
which implies that Senator 
, a candidate for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination, holds prejudice against French-Canadian Americans.
Two days later, Muskie delivers a famous “crying speech” apology, which severely harms his chances to beat George McGovern.
By the end of the year, it is revealed that the letter is forged by 
and 
, members of CREEP.
As evidence would later show, members of CREEP break into the Democratic National Committee’s Watergate headquarters and steal copies of top-secret documents.
In addition, they bug the office’s phones.
Because the original wiretaps failed to work properly, on June 17, CREEP returned to the Watergate building. At 2:30 a.m. five members of CREEP are arrested inside the DNC HQ.
1973: And Now, The End Is Near
After pleading innocent, 
, a former FBI agent, and 
, a former CIA employee and security director of CREEP, are found guilty of conspiracy, burglary and bugging the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee.
 and four others involved plead guilty and, thus, end their trials.
Established by the United States Senate Resolution 60, the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities—colloquially known as Senate Watergate Committee—begins its work, with Senator 
 acting as is its chairman.
Its mission is to investigate the break-in at the DNC HQ and “all other illegal, improper, or unethical conduct occurring during the presidential election of 1972, including political espionage and campaign finance practices.”
Two weeks after an official White House statement reiterates that President Nixon had no prior knowledge of the Watergate Scandal, several White House officials— 
, 
, and attorney general 
—resign from their positions.
Yet another one, 
, is fired; Nixon makes this known appearing on national television. What he doesn’t know yet is that Dean has already started cooperating with the Watergate persecutors.
The Senate Watergate Committee begins televised hearings. 
 is appointed as the Justice Department’s special prosecutor in the Watergate investigation.
John Dean testifies before the Senate Watergate Committee, giving a 245-page prepared statement which lasts a total of seven hours.
In it, he makes claims that not only Nixon was involved in the break-in cover-up, but also that the White House had conducted political espionage for years.
The day of arguably the most explosive revelation during the trials: supposing that he is merely confirming Haldeman’s testimony, 
 says that Nixon’s office had been taped since 1971:
By letter, Sam Ervin demands the tapes from Nixon, who, almost immediately after Butterfield’s testimony, disconnects the tapes. Nixon declines to turn over the tapes, saying that
Federal Judge 
 orders Nixon to hand in the tapes to him to be examined in private. Nixon refuses to comply yet again and appeals all orders and subpoenas related to surrendering the tapes.
On October 19, 1973, Nixon proposes a compromise to the Senate Watergate Committee. Namely, instead of handing over the tapes, Nixon suggests giving the Committee a summary of the White House conversations, personally edited by him, and later verified by Senator 
. 
Archibald Cox declines this compromise and orders the President to hand him over the tapes. 
Nixon orders Attorney General 
to fire Cox. Richardson, instead, resigns. Then Nixon orders Richardson’s deputy, 
, to fire Cox; he too prefers to resign instead. Finally, Richard Nixon’s solicitor general, 
, fires Cox.
This astonishing sequence of events is dubbed by the press “The Saturday Night Massacre,” a name which stands to this day.
Ten days later, 
 is named the new special prosecutor.
During a televised Q&A session with the Associated Press editors gathered at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, Nixon famously says that “people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I’m not a crook. I’ve earned everything I’ve got.”
The White House reveals that two of the subpoenaed recordings are missing and that one of the delivered ones—dated June 20, 1972—has an 18-minute gap. 
Nixon’s secretary, 
 claims that she must have accidentally erased the part in question by pushing the wrong foot pedal while talking on the phone.
However, photos posted for the media undermine the likelihood of such occurrence, and, soon after, experts conclude that there are multiple erasures.
As a result, people start suspecting that evidence is being destroyed. 
1974: What Happens in the White House (
) Stay in the White House
Seven members of Nixon’s former staff—known as the Watergate Seven—are indicted by a grand jury for their involvement in the post-Watergate break-in cover-up; many end up serving jail time. The Jury names Nixon an “unindicted co-conspirator.”
Ignoring the subpoenas, Nixon announces the release of 1,200 pages of edited transcripts of the remaining White House tapes. 
Even this turns public opinion against him: “Reading the transcripts is an emetic experience,” wrote the 
at the time, “one comes away feeling unclean.”
The Supreme Court unanimously (8–0) decides that the President must surrender all of the White House tapes. Nixon obliges six days later.
The tapes make known several crucial conversations, the most famous of which is one between the President and John Dean on March 21, 1973, in which Dean describes the Watergate cover-up as a “cancer on the presidency.”
A conversation between Nixon and Haldeman dated August 1, 1972, reveals that Nixon had both known about and approved the payments to the Watergate defendants:  “Well … they have to be paid. That’s all there is to that. They have to be paid.”
On August 5, 1974, a previously unknown conversation between Nixon and Haldeman, dated just six days after the Watergate break-in, is released.
The recording conclusively proves that Nixon and Haldeman obstructed justice by having the CIA falsely claim to the FBI that the Watergate break-in is a national security issue so as to prevent them from investigating further.
Referred to as “The Smoking Gun,” the tape proves—in the words of Nixon’s own lawyers—”that the President had lied to the nation, to his closest aides, and to his own lawyers – for more than two years.”
Facing certain impeachment, Richard Nixon decides to resign:
1974–2014: It’s Different… “When the President Does It”
Nixon’s successor, Gerald Ford, issues Proclamation 4311 which gives Nixon a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes he may have committed during his time as a president.
Described by 
as a “profoundly unwise, divisive and unjust act,” the pardon is often seen as one of the main reasons why Ford would lose the 1976 presidential election.
In the month of May 1977, after spending two years away from public life, Richard Nixon grants British journalist Robert Frost an exclusive series of interviews.
In the first part of the interview, Nixon apologizes for his actions:
However, when asked about the legality of his actions in the third part of the interview, Nixon replies in a highly controversial manner: “Well, when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.”
Four days after suffering a debilitating stroke, Richard Nixon dies at the age of 81, his image rehabilitated by a series of foreign trips and nine books.
 confirms something strongly suspected by everybody—including Nixon—ever since the first Woodward and Bernstein article: Deep Throat had been none other but former FBI agent, 
. Persuaded by his daughter to reveal his identity, Felt acknowledges the fact.
Four decades after Nixon’s resignation, historians Douglas Brinkley and Luke Nichter publish “
.” 
Final Notes
In total, the Watergate scandal resulted in 69 government officials being charged, and 48 of them being found guilty.
Nixon’s abuse of presidential power had a long-lasting effect on American voters, creating

Wonder what ants and sperm whales can teach you about the future of the United States?
Tropical biologist and ant expert Mark W. Moffett is your guy for questions such as this.
The title of his book says pretty much everything:
Who Should Read “The Human Swarm”? And Why?
As Michael Shermer, the author of 
and the publisher of the 
magazine has noted, 
is yet another addition to the Canon of Big History studies, joining classics such as Jared Diamond’s 
, Yuval Noah Harari’s 
, and Steven Pinker’s 
If you’ve read and liked any of these five books, then you’re sure to like 
as well. “This fine work,” says a starred review in 
, “should have broad appeal to anyone curious about human societies, which is basically everyone.” 
And really, there aren’t many books better—or more wide-ranging—than Mark W. Moffett’s 
 if you want to find out more about how human societies work and what makes them work.
About Mark W. Moffett
 is an American tropical biologist, specialized in the ecology of tropical forest canopies and the social behavior of ants.
Called “daring eco-adventurer” by none other than Margaret Atwood, Moffett is a research associate at the Smithsonian and a visiting scholar in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. 
He has received many awards for his work, including the Lowell Thomas Medal for exploration.
In addition to 
, Moffett has also written three more books:
, 
, and 
.
“The Human Swarm PDF Summary”
A 500-pages-long journey, meandering “through multiple and varied disembarkation points,” 
is divided into nine sections, each of which is in turn divided into several chapters.
We tried replicating the structure in our summary, which, unfortunately, does little justice to the magisterial effort that is Mark Moffett’s exceptional book.
Hopefully, however, our summary will inspire you to buy 
and read it yourself. 
Section I: Affiliation and Recognition
In the first section, 
, Mark W. Moffett talks about “the wide range of vertebrate societies.”
Whether by biologists or anthropologists, societies are often defined either in terms of identity or in terms of cooperation. 
As far as humans are concerned, the latter definition seems better: after all, we humans have evolved such that cooperation is central to our survival. 
However, following Benedict Anderson’s idea of the “imagined community,” Mark W. Moffett uses the introductory chapter to reconsider the role of cooperation in societies, and show that it is “less essential than the matter of identity.”
In other words, not just in humans, “societies consist of a distinct set of members in a rich tapestry of relationships, not all of which are harmonious. “
If you remember the ideas of any of the Enlightenment philosophers—say, 
 or 
—you already know that the basic idea behind the creation of society means giving away some of your own freedoms so that you get safety in return.
In this chapter, Moffett shows that the same mechanism works in vertebrates—and especially in the world of mammals.
Namely, despite the imperfections in the system of partnership, animal societies exist because they provide their members with better protection from outsiders and, thus, are a guarantee for the satisfaction of their basic needs.
You’ve probably heard the words “fission” and “fusion” before, right? However, we doubt that you’ve heard them in the context of animal and human societies.
Well, Moffett borrows them from the world of nuclear physics and reuses them here to describe a special type of animal societies: fission-fusion types.
“Fission-fusion sounds esoteric,” writes Moffett, “but there’s an abundance of reasons to look at this lifestyle. The fission-fusion species include virtually all the brainy mammals that anthropologists studying the social brain hypothesis salivate over—most significantly, us, 
”
What does a fission-fusion society entail?
Precisely what the two words imply: constant dispersion and recreation of the society.
In other words, in fission-fusion societies, “society members temporarily cluster here and there in social groups that form, dissolve, and reform elsewhere.”
As we’ve already uncovered above, we’re not talking merely about spotted hyenas, lions, bottlenose dolphins, bonobos, and chimpanzees; we’re talking about hunter-gatherers as well.
But we’ll get there.
Now, the most fascinating aspect of human societies—and the one Benedict Anderson was especially interested in—is that humans do not need to know each other for their societies to stay together.
Hence, “imagined communities.”
Put simply, in most animals, all members of a society are obliged to know each other as 
, whether they like it or not.
, you already know that there’s a limit to the number of people you can actually know, i.e., the number of people you can call friends.
British anthropologist Robin Dunbar gave us an actual number (now, of course, called Dunbar’s number): humans can maintain about 150 stable relationships.
However, most human societies number far, far more than 150 members. For example, there are 300 million people living in the United States!
Apparently, you don’t need to know them all—or even a significant number of them—to consider that they belong in the same society as you!
So, how did humans break free from the constraint of being obliged to know each member of a society and, thus, create the most powerful societies in history?
Read ahead to find out!
Section II: Anonymous Societies
We said above that there’s a population limit “in most animals;” the second section of 
is about the animals where such a limit doesn’t seem to exist: social insects.
No matter how strange it may seem to you, when it comes to building a society, we are more akin to ants than we are to bonobos. 
And Mark W. Moffett uses the fifth chapter to show why.
Almost expectedly, the size of a society increases its complexity—with almost no exception—which results in some ant societies being more similar to human societies than ape societies.
After all, unlike bonobos, ants are capable of doing all kinds of “human” things like building roads, creating traffic rules, having public hygiene workers, and even working on assembly lines!
How do ants know that they belong in the same community as other ants?
Well, because of chemistry, i.e., a scent; for comparison, another mighty society—that of the sperm whales—is founded upon another sense, i.e., shared sounds.
Neither scent nor sounds are memory-dependent; nor are they (with a few exceptions, but let’s not go into them) hackable.
In other words, the societies of ants and sperm whales can reach immense size because they can be sure in the allegiance of their members.
And they don’t allow in anyone who doesn’t have the same scent or can produce the same sound.
That’s why they are the ultimate nationalists.
Analogously, humans have broken the membership glass ceiling through comparable markers.
You know that you are an American—or whatever else—even though you haven’t met even 
 part of the members of your society, because of several markers you share with your fellow beings: language, religion, history, philosophy of life, etc.
And it goes even further and deeper than that, including behaviors so subtle they may only be noticed subliminally.
For example, in Iran and Bulgaria they nod for “no;” if you nod for “yes,” then you are an outsider.
Section III: Hunter-Gatherers Until Recent Times
The three chapters included in Section III ask what the societies of our species were like before the advent of agriculture. 
Moffett refers to as “band societies” the people who lived nomadically in small, spread-out groups called bands. 
This is the fusion-fission life we talked about before: 
“People mostly clumped here and there in bands,” writes Moffett. “Each band consisted of on average 25 to 35 individuals comprising several, usually unrelated, nuclear families, often spanning three generations.”
Normally, a person could visit other bands, yet tended to keep a long-term connection with one. 
“Shifts between bands usually came about with little effort but not often,” concludes Moffett, “a far cry from the eternally fluid movements of chimpanzees and other fission-fusion species characterized by ever-changing parties.”
“To get some idea of how a band society functioned in the day-to-day,” Moffett goes on in the next chapter, “think of each band, with its two- or three-dozen residents, not merely as a neighborhood in the social sense… [but also as] a local manufacturing center.”
More precisely:
But you already know this for two reasons: first and foremost, because the nomadic hunter-gatherer societies are treated as “the gold standard for our ancestral condition,” and secondly, because we’ve already introduced you to them via James Suzman’s exceptional 
.
However, the band societies weren’t the only type of hunter-gatherer societies that existed: there were also the settled hunter-gatherers as well.
And there’s a big difference between how a nomadic hunter-gatherer society functions, and what it turns into after settling.
If you remember from our summary of James Suzman’s book, nomadic hunter-gatherers are “equality-minded jacks-of-all-trades, who solved issues by discussion,” but the societies of settled hunter-gatherers have leaders, divide labor, and result in immense disparities in wealth.
Nowadays, most of us behave like settled hunter-gatherers. However, the very existence of nomadic hunter-gatherer societies is evidence in favor of “a psychological versatility we still possess.”
In other words, there’s another—arguably better—way for organization. Why did the other one win? That’s covered in Section IV. 
Section IV: The Deep History of Human Anonymous Societies
Section IV consists of only one chapter: “Pant-Hoots and Passwords;” it tries to explain 
 how nomadic life evolved into settled, but why settled hunter-gatherer societies were the only ones capable of becoming anonymous, which, as we explained above is the hallmark of a developed society.
In other words, at some point in the distant past, “our ancestors must have taken the crucial but heretofore overlooked evolutionary step of making use of badges of membership that would, in time, permit our societies to grow large.”
To understand how this happened, Moffett scrutinizes the behavior of our nearest relatives: the chimpanzees and the bonobos. 
And he puts forward a striking hypothesis.
Namely, that “a simple shift in how the apes use one of their vocalizations, the pant-hoot, could make that sound essential for identifying each other as society members.”
“Such a transformation,” Moffett explains, “could have easily occurred in our distant ancestors. Ever more markers would have been added to this initial ‘password,’ many of them connected to our bodies, transforming them into flesh-and-blood bulletin boards for displaying human identity.”
In other words, if your parents don’t approve of you getting a tattoo, tell them that tattoos are the reason why modern societies exist.
Section V: Functioning (or Not) in Societies
Section V moves on to exploring the psychology underlying these markers and society membership. It consists of five chapters.
In the first chapter of the fifth section of 
, Mark Moffett analyzes how these initial markers evolved to function the same way smells and sounds function in social ants and sperm whales.
In other words, in time, these artificial markers started possessing some underlying essence which made the members of one society (and ethnicity and race) feel so 
and 
 that, in comparison to other groups, they see themselves as nothing short of separate biological species.
Of course, 
, these markers are most powerful when they are (essentially fake) narratives which are passed over from generation to generation.
In order for this to happen, these fake narratives are also sacred and unquestionable: members who question them are questioned themselves, i.e. if you doubt the validity of a story shared by your community, people would start wondering if you are a member of that community or an outsider.
Yup, we’re talking about stereotypes.
In time, because of mechanisms such as the one described above, stereotypes get attached to prejudices, and prejudices are, 
, expressed automatically.
Because of this, members of a society often perceive an outsider not as a unique individual—which he/she, by definition, is—but as a member of another society.
This, in turn, deepens the differences between societies and results in using the outsider societies as a cohesive element for any given society.
It seems that we have an innate “penchant for ranking outsiders as ‘below’ our own people or in some cases as subhuman altogether.”
In other words, because of the deepened differences between societies, a person can believe that, even though 
 
a unique individual functioning within a society relatively freely, a member of another society acts solely as a clog in a larger machine which has goals and objectives of its own.
“We are disposed to discount the differences between individuals,” writes Moffett, “and to perceive the members of other societies—and to a lesser extent those of our own—as both similar and forming a unified whole.”
The final chapter of the fifth sections considers “the ways in which the psychology of families relates to perceptions of our society, granting the influence of both in human affairs.”
In other words, are societies something like extended families?
The interesting conclusion is that, even though, by definition, they are not—families share genes, and communities nothing but imagined stories—they are still as foundational and as important about the healthy development of the human psyche as families.
Section VI: Peace and Conflict
Titled “Peace and Conflict,” Section VI takes on “the issue of the relationships among societies.”
The good news: the answer to the question above is “no.”
The bad news: “while animal societies need not be in conflict, peace between them is relatively rare, present in just a few species and supported by situations of minimal competition.”
As you know full well, in addition to your highly developed neocortex, your brain also includes the amygdala, still wired the way it is in all animals, i.e., firing its “age-old cautionary reflexes of fight or flight” around the clock!
That is why “even for groups on excellent terms, sublimated biases ensure the playing field is never perfectly level, as each side jockeys for a better deal.”
After all, even hunter-gatherer societies—relatively peaceful between each other when there were enough resources—didn’t act peacefully when resources and opportunities would dry up.
So, how do we keep the peace when competition is raging?
Well, 
, there’s some good news:
Section VII: The Life and Death of Societies
Section VII, “The Life and Death of Societies,” examines “how societies come together and fall apart.” 
Even though “the dynamics of society genesis and transformation play out in a manner unique to each species,” depending on “the rules by which the members of the species interact and identify each other, and the resources available at a certain time,” a theme emerges:
And this theme—analyzes Moffett throughout this whole section—is observable in both animal and human societies.
As an excellent example of how an animal society crumbles, Moffett uses the case of the Gombe chimpanzees documented by Jane Goodall in the early 1970s.
When Goodall first came to Gombe about a decade before 1971, there was no evidence of factions. But in that year, it was clearly visible that the original group had split into factions, later named Kasakela (on the north) and Kahama (on the south).
At first, the two factions were somewhat amicable between each other, but after some time the Kasakela apes obliterated the Kahama community and took back much of its territory in the following few years.
“The two-step process at Gombe—the emergence of internal factions followed by division—seems to be omnipresent among primates that live in societies, having now been documented for the troops of at least a couple dozen monkey species,” writes Moffett?
Is the same true about human societies as well?
Unfortunately—yes.
And the reason is simple: as Charles Darwin wrote in the final sentence of 
: “Endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.”
And this evolution occurs at different rates, and over time, creates insurmountable obstacles.
To understand this better, think of languages splitting over time: it is difficult to note a point in time when this happens, but it is evident that it happens.
Well, the same occurs with human societies as well.
Simply put, the markers which keep a society together can’t be shared for all times. 
And when they are no longer recognized by all members of a single community, that community breaks into factions, the members of which no longer see each other as being similar.
“In fact,” writes Moffett, “the metamorphosis of societies as they splinter off from each other has been labeled ‘pseudo-speciation,’ in effect turning what had been one species of human into two.”
Hunter-gatherer societies fell apart because of poor communication across hunter-gatherer bands; modern human societies fall apart because the original uniting markers keeping a society together are no longer shared. 
It is not only that imagined things unite us—it is also that imagined things (or even stranger: their reinterpretations) separate us as well.
Section VIII: Tribes to Nations
The penultimate section of 
, titled “Tribes to Nations,” explores the social changes which made the expansion of societies into states (nations) possible.
So, how did settled hunter-gatherer societies evolve to become something bigger, and, eventually, nations?
Precisely as you would expect them to: by conquering other societies.
Mark Moffett says that across the animal kingdom there’s little to no evidence of societies freely merging. 
So, it’s only natural to suppose that early human tribes didn’t merge either.
After some time, due to growth or need for it (roadways, ships, etc.), leaders of certain villages decided to expand their dominion over the territories of their neighbors.
This resulted in something exceptional: the original fold started including outsiders.
Most animal societies don’t want that: when the society of the Gombe chimpanzees split, one faction wanted to destroy the other.
However, humans—like some social ants—developed something far better than this: believe it or not, slavery!
Due to slavery and the subjugation of entire groups of people, the exchange of membership between tribes was taken to a whole new level.
Outsiders were now members of the original fold, but they didn’t share the same status. Even though unwillingly, however, they worked for the benefit of this new tribe.
Precisely because of the fact that these new and larger tribes didn’t consider the outsiders as equals, they were built to be destroyed from the start.
“What’s typical of societies put together by conquest,” writes Moffett, “isn’t division between factions… nor utter collapse, though it can happen, but rather a fracturing that almost always occurs roughly along the ancient territorial lines of the peoples that have come to make up the society.”
Because of this, “large societies may be no more durable than small ones, fragmenting on average once every few centuries,” as archeologist Joyce Marcus has demonstrated.
Section IX: From Captive to Neighbor… To Global Citizen?
The final section explores the “circuitous route that led to the rise of ethnicities and races and the, at times, muddy waters of current national identities.”
“To become an interlocking whole,” writes Moffett, “a conquering society had to make the shift from controlling what had been independent groups to accepting them as members.”
This, of course, “requires an adjustment in people’s identities, in which ethnic minority groups adjust to the majority people—the dominant group that most often founded the society and controls not only its identity but also most of the resources and power.”
However, as we implied above, this assimilation can only be accomplished to a degree.
You don’t need to look further back than the 20
 century to understand what we mean: both Yugoslavia and the USSR broke apart because “no society can persist unless being a part of it is important to its people.”
That’s why, in the 1970s, no Yugoslav or Soviet would have believed that their countries would eventually balkanize into smaller states. But only twenty years later—this seemed all but inevitable.
Suddenly, Yugoslavia and USSR meant less to people than, say, Serbia and Croatia, or Georgia and Armenia—as it had been before their creation.
Now, there’s another way to incorporate other humans within a society: immigration.
As you know full well, it is almost always the case that immigrants are assigned lower power and status when compared to the natives. 
In addition, “the identity immigrants had once treasured in their ethnic homeland is often recast into broader racial groups. The shift in perception may initially be pushed on the newcomers, but they can accept the changes because of the advantages of having a more extensive base of social support in the adopted society.”
Of course, the more immigrants come, the fiercer the opposition against them is because, as is often the case, they want to save their identity by ghettoizing. And that’s how and why nationalism and patriotism develop.
And the circle won’t be broken.
In an address to the United Nations, Ronald Reagan once made the following observation: “I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world.”
If you’ve read/seen 
, you know what Reagan was thinking: when the definition of an outsider changes, the definition of the member of a society changes as well.
An outsider can be a person who speaks another language—but only until someone who, say, walks on four feet and doesn’t understand the difference between languages attack us. Then, the outsider from yesterday becomes your ally; and, thus, you learn to see the similarities between you and start ignoring the differences.
So, will a global human society form if humankind is forced to face a common enemy?
Mark Moffett doesn’t believe that—even though no single society is essential, societies (as a phenomenon) are more than necessary for growth and interhuman understanding, and our 
 will survive even the threat of Martians.
“Space aliens wouldn’t make nations irrelevant any more than Europeans arriving in Australia caused Aborigines to dispense with their tribes,” writes Moffett. “That would be so regardless of how much the aliens shattered the beliefs people held about their own societies, whose beloved differences would now look trivial by comparison.”
“Moreover,” he goes on, “when societies of our species turn to one another, whether for commercial advantage or to defend against aliens, that reliance doesn’t diminish the weight they place on their differences. The notion of cosmopolitanism, the idea that the people of the world will come to feel a primary connection to the human race, is a pipe dream.”
“Divided we will be,” Moffett concludes somewhat bittersweetly, “and divided we must stand.”
Key Lessons from “The Human Swarm”
1.      Anonymous Societies Are Complex Societies
2.      Stereotypes Are Built into the Very Fabric of Human Societies
3.      Societies Have Always Been and Always Will Be Inevitable
Anonymous Societies Are Complex Societies
The questions “why haven’t chimpanzees formed more complex societies?” and “why did the equality-minded nomads who solved issues by discussion lose the organizational war to the settled agricultural communities?” have pretty much the same answer: because only anonymous societies are complex and prosper.
Ants have anonymous societies, and so do sperm whales; chimpanzees, unlike developed humans, don’t.
In an anonymous society, it isn’t necessary that you know all members of your community because there are ways you can differentiate them from the rest.
Ants, for example, use unchangeable scents, and sperm whales—sounds. 
Humans use very complex networks of symbols—called markers—which can include everything from language and religion to clothing and subliminal gestures.
Stereotypes Are Built into the Very Fabric of Human Societies
We think of stereotypes as something one can be done with.
Unfortunately, stereotypes are built into the fabric of human societies: it is impossible for a society to exist in the first place if it doesn’t devise stories in which it is both different and superior to outsiders.
The very idea of an outsider stems from the existence of a stereotype, a story which defines a society. 
And thousands of years ago, it made absolute sense for a member of any society to trust his inner stereotypes. 
For comparison, if a chimpanzee ventures into the territory of a different group, it will almost certainly be killed.
Societies Have Always Been and Always Will Be Inevitable
Even though it may seem like a nice thought experiment a war-of-the-worlds or Armageddon-scenario in which all humans unite in one super-society because of an external threat once and for all—this, says Mark Moffett, is very unlikely.
Simply put, even before they are created, all societies have an inherent expiration date, for the simple reason that both their members and their unifying markers evolve unpredictably.
In time, some of these markers—say, language or religion—start meaning/looking differently for different people, and that’s how factions are formed. 
So, even if we manage to create one 
 human society in some very distant future, it is inevitable that this society too should fall apart in no more than five hundred years.

“Maybe You Should Talk To Someone PDF Summary”
 is a book which asks, “How do we change?” and answers with “In relation to others.”
Author’s words—not ours.
But it’s difficult to say much more than that: a unique type of memoir, 
is an exceptional book by an exceptional therapist about the nature of the relationships with her patients, but also a book about her own relationship with her own therapist, i.e., a chronicle of how she became a patient herself. 
The goal?
To reveal our shared humanity so that we can see ourselves more clearly.
Throughout the book, Gottlieb zig-zags between her experiences with her therapist Wendell, and the experiences of four of her patients (John, Rita, Julie, Charlotte) with 
 as the therapist. 
We’ll mainly focus on Lori in our summary, but we’ll mention some of her patients as well.
What Lies Beneath the Presenting Problem
“It all starts with a presenting problem,” says Lori Gottlieb.
And a presenting problem, by definition, is “the issue that sends a person into therapy.”
“It might be a panic attack, a job loss, a death, a birth, a relational difficulty, an inability to make a big life decision, or a bout of depression,” writes Gottlieb. “Sometimes the presenting problem is less specific—a feeling of ‘stuckness’ or the vague but nagging notion that something just isn’t quite right.”
The problem with the presenting problem?
Well, it’s not the 
 problem!
We can illustrate this with quite a few of Lori’s patients’ stories, but you know this already from one of our recent summaries. 
Allow us to remind you of that one once more.
If you remember well, 
 she merely wanted to talk to him about her frustration with the election of Donald Trump.
“People don’t care about inflection points when they come for their first therapy session,” inform us Gottlieb. “Mostly, they just want relief. They want to tell you their stories, beginning with their presenting problem.”
However, they end up somewhere else after a few months—namely, they end up finding out that their problem was merely the first layer, the curtain under which something much darker lies buried.
For Chelsea, the real problem was the never-gotten-over death of her beloved 22-year-old brother Chet when she was just 9.
Trump’s election merely repeated the sequence: things were going great, and then—boom!—the whole world was out of its joint.
 that “People will do anything, no matter how absurd, to avoid facing their own souls.”
But he also said this: “Who looks inside, awakes.”
The Interesting Paradox of the Therapy Process
We’ve already talked about 
 and how much energy our brain spends to rationalize our irrational behavior.
The result?
 and that the whole world is to blame for our misfortune; everyone—but us.
The interesting bit?
Well, even if you know this, there’s no way you can prevent it. It’s just the way we’re built.
Take it from the author of this book.
She’s a well-known psychotherapist—in fact, she writes the weekly “Dear Therapist” advice column for The Atlantic—and, yet, she wasn’t able to help herself when she faced a serious problem. On the contrary: when she went to a psychotherapist, she did precisely what she had advised all of her patients not to do—i.e., lied to herself to look better in her story.
And, as she informs us, that’s the interesting paradox of the therapy process:
#1. Death: “Let Me Fill You In On the Boyfriend Incident…”
What was Lori Gottlieb’s problem, you ask?
One of the most common ones: A Boyfriend.
The guy we’re talking about here—for obvious reasons, Lori refers to him as nothing more but the Boyfriend—was going out with our therapist for two years, and then, out of the blue, put an end to their relationship, just around the time when Lori was making plans for a wedding.
The reason?
Well, Gottlieb had an eight-year-old child, and the Boyfriend deemed this an unnecessary complication in his life. It was a problem he had never mentioned before, so, of course, in Lori’s eyes, all of this made the Boyfriend either selfish or a liar—or both!
And that’s what she wanted her psychiatrist—a certain Dr. Wendell (of course, his name is changed too)—to confirm. She felt life would be a lot easier of someone as qualified would back up her story.
However, Dr. Wendell wouldn’t admit that the Boyfriend was a sociopath.
He just listened and listened, picking up cues. After all, he did know that the Boyfriend was actually the presenting problem. The only way he could reach the real problem was 
.
And one day, he picked up the real cue: Lori said that her life was half over.
Wendell realized: the frustration over her ex-boyfriend was merely an external symptom which masked something rooted deep within Lori—her pretty tangible fear of death.
You see, Lori was already in her late 40s, and, not that long before her therapy session, had begun experiencing a mysterious illness which none of her doctors could diagnose.
The Boyfriend—and the imagined future built around him—served as a kind of curtain covering this fear. His going away left Lori to face the fear alone.
#2. Isolation: The Importance of Human Connection
Wendell told Lori that, with the loss of her Boyfriend, she had lost more than her relationship in the present: she lost her relationship in the future as well. 
“We tend to think that the future happens later,” he went on, “but we’re creating it in our minds every day. When the present falls apart, so does the future we had associated with it. And having the future taken away is the mother of all plot twists.”
Unfortunately, if we spend the present trying to fix the past or control the future, “we remain stuck in place, in perpetual regret.”
Lori couldn’t do anything else but Google-stalking her Boyfriend because she felt that her life had ended. Moreover, that, due to her age, she would never find another partner to be with her.
There’s nothing worse than loneliness, is there? 
That’s why the worst kind of punishment is solitary confinement.
Unfortunately, sometimes, we pass this judgment upon ourselves, by being not open enough to meet new people, by treating poorly the ones who are around us, or, simply, by being afraid that we won’t be accepted.
That was the story of Rita, a divorced patient of Lori who came to her expressing regret over her “bad choices” and a life poorly lived. She even thought about ending it if she doesn’t find a way to better it through her therapy sessions.
In a way, it was the therapy sessions themselves that did the trick: Rita needed someone to talk to. She had been isolated for a decade, coming to the point of splurging on pedicures just so that she could feel some human touch.
It came from a woman named Connie who didn’t speak “a lick of English;” but her touching her feet was enough to keep her alive.
#3. Meaning: Happiness Is an Abnormal Condition
 starts with an eye-opening epigraph, which has haunted us ever since we opened it for the first time:
Before you scoff it off, let us tell you that this is not merely a philosophical rumination over the nature of happiness.
Oh no!
It’s the author’s abstract of “
” by Richard P. Bentall, a Professor of Clinical Psychology, published in the Journal of Medical Ethics in 1992.
What does this tell us?
Well, something 
, 
, 
—and many others—have been telling us all along: that it’s pointless to make happiness your objective in life.
Why?
For the simple reason that nobody ever has been permanently happy. Happiness, in other words, is temporary, has a lot to do with your biology, and is, thus, all but unattainable.
What you should strive for, instead?
Meaning.
We get nothing out of 
 things, and, as Frankl so memorably told us, it is only when we find some meaning that we can fight through things.
That’s why guys like 
 or 
 sound so conservative at times: religion, for example, offers pre-packed meaning and, even if wrong, 
.
Lori experienced this herself.
During her therapy sessions with Wendell, she realized that her Boyfriend was not merely a way to hide her fear of death from herself, but also a great distraction from something which had made her anxious for a while.
Namely, Lori had a book deal with a publisher to write something on the subject of helicopter parenting. She felt utterly disconnected from the topic, and every time she would sit down to write something, she felt uneasiness that struck her to her very core.
Because, you see, Lori had received an advance for that book. Moreover, she had already spent it. And the fact that she was obliged to return the money wasn’t the most frightening part. It was the fear that, in the future, she wouldn’t get another deal (at least that’s what her agent had told her).
However, through her therapy sessions with Wendell, Lori realized that all of this was, once again, just a complex distraction.
The real problem was that Lori didn’t 
write that book: she found the work meaningless and 
 to write something else.
Encouraged by her therapist, she returned the advance and started writing this other book.
Its title:
#4. Freedom: Unstuck Yourself
According to the person-centered approach to therapy, there are four reasons why one seeks the help of a professional. 
We went over three of them—death, isolation, meaning in life—so it’s time to round things up with the fourth one: lack of a sense of freedom.
That’s precisely what Lori felt due to her book deal and the advance that came with it. Simply put, she wanted out of it, she wanted to find a way to 
.
True, it seemed complicated, but Lori 
have a choice; unfortunately, a patient of hers named Julie didn’t.
A thirty-three-year-old university professor diagnosed with cancer upon returning from her honeymoon, Julie was objectively trapped in her situation.
In a way, there was no way out of it: she had no choice but to face the inevitable.
However, 
to do that is an entirely different matter. And that’s where therapy and Lori proved helpful.
Over time, Julie decided that crumbling beneath the weight of the news is pretty much the same as dying before your time. Embracing the new kind of freedom meant living to your last breath.
And she did just that!
She started risking the way she had never risked before, for the simple reason that she had nothing to lose. And she learned that switching from professorship to being a cashier was a great decision at that time in her life: she craved for social contact, and as a professor, she barely had one.
If that sounds like another version of the plot of Ricky Gervais’ 
, it’s because it is. 
, but it’s also what makes life worth living.
So, no matter how painful it is—rip off the band-aid sooner rather than later.
Key Lessons from “Maybe You Should Talk To Someone”
1.      The Presenting Problem Is Merely a Curtain for the Real Problem
2.      We Rationalize Too Much to Be Able to Trust Ourselves
3.      There Are Four Reasons Why People Go to Therapy 
The Presenting Problem Is Merely a Curtain for the Real Problem
When someone goes to a therapist, usually, the first question that he/she hears is the one Lori Gottlieb considers the best ice-breaker out there: “So, tell me what brings you here today?”
However, Lori—and all good therapists, in fact—are aware that the answer to this question is never the answer to the real question: what is 
troubling the patient?
The answer to the question above is always something therapists refer to as “the presenting problem.” The “real problem,” however, lies much deeper, and can be unearthed through hours and hours of discussion.
We Rationalize Too Much to Be Able to Trust Ourselves
The reason why therapists need hours and hours to unearth the 
problem underneath the 
 problem is simple: as a species, humans are exceptionally good at lying. 
And, 
, the easiest person to fool is yourself.
Unfortunately, even if you know this, there’s no way around it without the kind and carefully directed words of another person.
Put otherwise, when you go to a psychotherapist, you’re already prepacked with a narrative which gives an explanation about all of your decisions, making you a nice person in his/her eyes.
It is his/her job to dig around these stories and, like a modern Sherlock Holmes, pick up a clue which would redirect the discussion to a territory you’ve never trodden before.
Because, let’s face it, that’s the only territory you’d want to go if you want to sort out your problems.
There Are Four Reasons Why People Go to Therapy
, there are four ultimate concerns, i.e., four givens of existence: death, isolation, meaning in life, and freedom.
In a way, all of your problems, frustrations, and anxieties boil down to one—or even all—of them.

If the subtitle isn’t a giveaway, 
is primarily a book directed at women and policy-makers.


Who Should Read “The Moment of Lift”? And Why?
Women should read it to understand that they are all in the fight for equality together, and policy-makers to understand why this fight is just.
Read this book even more carefully if you are a man: hopefully, it will help you see the extent of women’s troubles worldwide, and—who knows?—maybe even turn you into a feminist.
About Melinda Gates
 is a philanthropist, businesswoman, and feminist.
After receiving a bachelor’s degree in computer science from Duke University and an M.B.A. from Duke’s Fuqua School, Melinda got a job at Microsoft, where she worked for almost a decade, before leaving the company to focus on her family and philanthropic work. 
As the co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Melinda “sets the direction and priorities of the world’s largest philanthropy.” In addition, she has also founded Pivotal Ventures, an investment and incubation company.
is her first book.
 “The Moment of Lift PDF Summary”
Launched in 2000, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) is the largest private foundation of the world (and, thus, the world’s largest private charitable organization as well) with primary aims to reduce extreme poverty, expand educational opportunities, and enhance healthcare all over the world.
In 
, Melinda Gates tells the whole story behind it: its beginnings, its objectives, its utopian dreams of contributing to a better future.
The main focus is girls and women—because they 
be.
Don’t agree with us?
Well, Melinda Gates would like to change your mind!
Chapter 1 | The Lift of a Great Idea
Soon after founding the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Melinda went to Malawi “and was deeply moved to see so many mothers standing in long lines in the heat to get shots for their kids.”
What got her attention even more was the answer of a young mother with small kids when asked by her, “Are you taking these beautiful children to get their shots?”
“What about 
 shot?” she replied. “Why do I have to walk twenty kilometers in this heat to get my shot?” 
“She wasn’t talking about a vaccination,” comments Melinda. “She was talking about Depo-Provera, a long-acting birth control injection that could keep her from getting pregnant.”
A mother named Sadi Seyni from a small village in Niger said something even more terrifying: “It wouldn’t be fair for me to have another child. I can’t afford to feed the ones I have now!”
In time, Melinda realized that these were not lonely voices in the wilderness—this was the leitmotif. Namely, most of these poor African women wanted to protect their children, and the best idea they had in mind was 
having more of them.
Only, they couldn’t afford that.
Their experiences comply with the available data.
As Melinda says, in 2012, in the world’s 69 poorest countries, 260 million women were using contraceptives. 
That’s the good news.
The bad news?
Over 200 million more women in these nations 
 to use contraceptives—but couldn’t get them.
The problem goes even deeper than you’d think.
As a Bangladeshi study spanning over two decades has discovered, contraceptives make the lives of both the mothers and the children better and longer.
“It took us years to learn that contraceptives are the greatest life-saving, poverty-ending, women-empowering innovation ever created,” concludes Melinda.
Fortunately, now we know.
Chapter 2 | Empowering Mothers: Maternal and Newborn Health
“Socialism never took root in America,” wrote someone somewhere (probably Ronald Wright in 
),
because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.”
Socialism aside—the second part of the quote sounds quite true: because of the American Dream, most Americans believe that the poor are simply 
 and that not having enough money to meet your own needs speaks much more about you than the system.
However, throughout her work—and through an enlightening discussion with the late great 
—Melinda Gates learned another, much better definition of poverty:
What does this mean in practice?
3 million newborns die 
, and most of them die because of poverty. In other words, most of these 3 million deaths happen in far-off, impoverished places where death holds dominion over areas of life from which it has been banished in the West long, long time ago.
Fortunately, since the early 1990s, the global vaccination drive cut the number of childhood deaths in half.
You can see where this is going already: if you want to help mothers protect their children, give them access to free vaccination.
Also—as we read in the first chapter—give them access to free contraception as well; because, instead of getting better, things are getting worse during the last few years.
Chapter 3 | Every Good Thing: Family Planning
In 1994, the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo drew more than 10,000 participants from around the world. 
It is still the largest conference of its kind and, as Melinda Gates says, it marks “a historic early statement on the rights of women and girls.”
Why?
Because it unambiguously “urged the empowerment of women, set goals for women’s health and education, and declared that access to reproductive health services, including family planning, is a basic human right.”
The problem?
Funding for family planning hasn’t increased since 1994; in fact, it has dropped 
 since Cairo.
Why?
Well, blame it on the conservative governments who are coming to power all over the world.
Don’t believe us?
Well, take the United States as an example.
During the past few decades, the US was exceptionally successful in bringing down teen pregnancy rates. 
In fact, the country is at a historic low for teen pregnancy, and the number of unintended pregnancies is one of the lowest in history as well.
What brought about this outcome?
Two things.
First of all, the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program, which spends $100 million a year to reach low-income teens in communities across the United States.
And secondly—yes!—the Affordable Care Act, which allows women to get contraceptives without paying for them out of their pocket.
You know where this is going, don’t you?
“Unfortunately,” notes Melinda Gates, “that progress is in jeopardy—both the drop in unwanted pregnancies and the policies that helped make it happen. The current administration is working to dismantle programs that provide family planning and reproductive health services.”
Why?
Beats us!
.
It seems that the goal of his policies is to replace programs proven to work with programs proven 
 to work. (Abstinence-only sex? Really?)
Chapter 4 | Lifting Their Eyes: Girls in School
Because of the reasons Melinda Gates uncovers above, she decided that family planning should be one of the main objectives of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
“But every time I’ve thought, 
,” she notes, “I’d meet another woman or girl who would show me a 
 picture. And my most important teachers were not the experts we would meet with in Seattle. They were women and girls who met us in their towns and talked about their dreams.”
Well, one of these girls was Sona, a 10-year-old from a very poor community in a village called Kanpur.
Kanpur is mainly inhabited by the lowest of Indian castes. If you’ve read our summary of the incredible journalistic work that is 
you can already guess how life looks like in Kanpur.
For most of the people there, the highlight of the month is finding something valuable in the trash that can be sold in return for some money.
Family planning is just one of the problems here.
And, intuitively, the 10-year-old Sona knew that full well.
“I want a teacher,” she would repeatedly say to Gary Darmstadt, a foundation colleague of Melinda, when he went to Kanpur in 2011 to talk about family planning.
Family planning is helpful.
But the truth is, unless the kids of the women taught about family planning, get some kind of education they’re going to live the same lives as their parents.
No end to the cycle without lifting their eyes, without making it possible for girls to attend school!
Why just girls?
Well, because in most low-income countries, for every 100 boys who go into tertiary education, 55 girls stay at home!
Why is that?
Find out in the summary of the next chapter.
Chapter 5 | The Silent Inequality: Unpaid Work
As we said above, the picture is even bigger than family planning and education. And that’s because even educated women have the misfortune of facing thousands and thousands of hurdles in the world of work.
But, yet again, we’re not merely talking about 
; we’re talking about something Melinda Gates refers to as “the silent inequality,” i.e., unpaid work.
Kanpur may be a poor neighborhood inhabited by the most conservative of people, so one would expect for women—and even girls—to carry out all the errands, including childcare itself.
But India is a powerhouse.
And yet, the data says that Indian men engage in only one hour of unpaid work on a daily basis, while women engage in no less than six!
And the same holds true even for the richest countries in the world!
In the United States, for example, women engage in unpaid work at least one and a half hour more than men—on a daily basis.
That means that during any given week, women work one workday more than men—which makes all the difference 
 if they are paid equally for the rest of their work (which, oftentimes, are 
).
How are we supposed to mend this?
Inspired by Marylin Waring’s exceptionally important book titled 
, economist Diane Elson devised the 3R framework to shrink the gender gap regarding unpaid work.
Its three steps are quite simple when you think about it:
#1: We should start by 
 that unpaid work is being done; that, of course, means that governments should start counting the hours both men and women spend in unpaid work;
#2. Afterward, we should work our best to 
 the number of unpaid work hours, using modern technology (not only cookstoves and washing machines but also breast pumps);
#3. Finally, we need to 
 the work we can’t reduce so that men and women share it more equitably.
Sounds like a nice plan, doesn’t it?
Chapter 6 | When a Girl Has No Voice: Child Marriage
Do you know what is the number one cause of death for girls aged 15 to 19 worldwide?
Believe it or not, going through childbirth!
Why would that be a problem, you ask?
Of course, because it’s happening in low-income and emerging economies; but, also, because tradition works hand in hand with poverty to make these things happen.
What precisely do we have in mind?
Two words: child marriage.
So widespread phenomenon that about a third of girls living in emerging economies are married off as teenagers; even worse, every tenth girl in these countries has a husband before turning even 15!
Why?
Because, unlike a son, a daughter can be married off for money, which makes her marriage a double boon for her family: more money, and one less child to take care of.
Add to that biased traditions devised in some times when empathy was barely even a word, and you get a certain recipe for disaster.
“Tradition without discussion kills moral progress,” writes Melinda Gates.
“If you’re handed a tradition and decide not to talk about it—just do it—then you’re letting people from the past tell you what to do. It kills the chance to see the blind spots in the tradition—and moral blind spots always take the form of excluding others and ignoring their pain.”
On the other hand:
And that’s what the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, in partnership with Tostan, and Dutch Princess Mabel van Oranje’s foundation “Girls Not Brides” are constantly doing.
Hopefully, in a very recent future, child marriages will be a thing of the past, and girls will be allowed to choose their husbands, and their next career moves even in poorer countries.
Chapter 7 | Seeing Gender Bias: Women in Agriculture
In 2015, during another one of Melinda Gates’ visits to Malawi, she met a farmer named Patricia, so dedicated to her seeds and crops that she—and she alone from her whole farming community—spent Christmas Day in a field a mile away from the celebrations, “kneeling on the damp earth in her half-acre farm plot, planting groundnuts.”
“You’d think that someone with Patricia’s dedication would be hugely successful,” writes Melinda Gates, “but for years, she had struggled.”
Why?
You’ve guessed it alright: because she is a woman with the misfortune of being born in sub-Saharan Africa!
What does this mean in practice?
Well, first of all, women in Malawi are not allowed to inherit land, which means that Patricia has to pay rent for her field; secondly, no matter how dedicated she is, if she needs additional farming supplies, she would have to ask for her husband’s permission, because she—as most of the Malawi women—has no control over the family’s money.
The result?
In spite of Patricia’s painstaking work, even the basics had been out of reach for her and her family. Not only she didn’t have money for school fees for her kids, but she also didn’t have money to buy a set of cooking pots, let alone something more.
Fortunately, the CARE Pathways, a program dedicated to teaching agricultural techniques and gender equality in agriculture, spelled the way out of this dreadful situation for both Patricia and her family. 
After they both attended, her husband started listening to her more, and Patricia was able to buy better seeds. This quadrupled her crop yield and allowed her to send her children to school. Inspired by her, other women joined in.
That’s merely the beginning of course: if women in agriculture are empowered the way Patricia is, the resulting food surplus could lift 150 million people out of hunger and poverty.
And now you know why Melinda Gates and the BMGF is interested in agriculture!
Chapter 8 | Creating a New Culture: Women in the Workplace
In 1987, when Melinda Gates graduated, 35% of IT graduates in the USA were women; nowadays, it’s only 19%.
According to her, there are many reasons for the drop, but the three most important ones are gender biased:
#1. PCs were usually marketed as gaming devices for boys, so boys spent more time in front of them than girls in the early days;
#2. The ideal computer coder is often seen as someone with no outside interests or social skills (hence, this often screens out women much more than men);
#3. And finally—and most terrifyingly—managers hired many more women for IT-related jobs when programming was seen as clerical in nature, and hire many more men nowadays when it is understood as something more complex.
Another reason is the staggering fact that only 2% of venture capital partners are women, and only 2% of venture capital money is going to women-founded ventures! 
This is the reason why Melinda Gates is investing in specialized venture capital funds—such as Aspect Ventures—that invest in companies led by women or people of color.
“This isn’t charity on my part,” notes Gates.
“I expect a good return, and I’m confident I’ll get one because women are going to see markets that men won’t see, and black and Latina and Asian women will see markets that white entrepreneurs won’t see. I think we’ll look back in ten years and see it was crazy that more money wasn’t flowing toward markets understood by women and people of color.”
Remember the Hammurabi Code as described by Harari in 
?
If not, here’s a reminder: according to the Code, one eye of a male commoner was worth twice the life of a female commoner.
Why?
Well, because the Code was written by men.
And that should explain to you more about Melinda Gates’ decision to invest in Aspect Ventures than anything else.
“If societies are going to elevate women to equality with men—and declare that people of any race or religion have the same rights as anyone else—then we have to have men and women and every racial and religious group together writing the code,” writes Gates.
And then she gives the best argument for diversity we’ve ever read: “Diversity is the best way to defend equality.”
“If people from diverse groups are not making the decisions,” Melinda clarifies things, “the burdens and benefits of society will be divided unequally and unfairly—with the people writing the rules ensuring themselves a greater share of the benefits and a lesser share of the burdens of any society.”
“No group should have to trust another to protect their interests,” she concludes; “all should be able to speak for themselves. “
Highlight that, and never forget it.
Chapter 9 | Let Your Heart Break: The Lift of Coming Together
After returning once again to Hans Rosling and his last lesson given to Melinda Gates, the final chapter of 
brings the author’s discussion to a worthy closure.
“Every issue in this book is a door women must walk through, or a wall we must break through,” she writes, “to become full contributors.”
Whether it is the right for women to decide whether and when to have children, to marry or not marry, to seek opportunity, attend a university, control their income, manage their time, pursue their goals, and/or advance in the workplace—women need to meet, talk, organize and lead, so that they can break down the walls and open the doors for 
.
Of course, a casual reader might read into this paragraph something akin to exclusion. 
Well, what about the men? he might ask.
“I’m not saying we should include women and girls 
 men and boys,” answers Gates, “but 
. This is not about bringing women in and leaving others out. It’s about bringing women in as a way to bring everyone in.”
And then she concludes:
Key Lessons from “The Moment of Lift”

3.      The Policies of Inclusion vs. The Culture of Exclusion
Women Suffer More Than Men—In Oh So Many Ways
In her journeys throughout the world as a public advocate and a dedicated implementer and facilitator of the altruistic mission of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Melinda Gates learned a painful truth (somewhat muddled by modern alt-right conservatives): that women suffer much, much more than men.
Hundreds of millions of them want to decide for themselves whether and when to have children, but they can’t because they have no access to contraceptives. 
Others don’t have the right to decide whether and when and whom to marry. Millions don’t have the right to go to school or earn an income. 
Some are forbidden to work outside the home or even 
 outside the home—which results in so many women worldwide not having enough money let alone their own space (
).
Starting a business, owning a property, running for office, finding inventors—you name the right, millions of women don’t have it!
Even when they’re allowed by law!
Why Melinda Gates Speaks Up for Women
If the reasons above are not enough for you, here’s the story behind 
.
Melinda Gates started her philanthropic journey two decades ago as an advocate of family planning, believing that contraception would solve so many problems of the women around the world.
However, as time passed, she learned that this is merely the start. It did help a lot, but women were still denied the right to education, with 13 million girls being forced into marriages before reaching the age of 15 on a yearly basis.
And what about owning some land, being paid for household chores, or doing away with the gender-biased work atmosphere?
“I quickly realized—because I was quickly 
—that it wasn’t enough to speak up for family planning,” writes Melinda Gates. “I had to speak up for women. And I soon saw that if we are going to take our place as equals with men, it won’t come from winning our rights one by one or step by step; we’ll win our rights in waves as we become empowered. “
The Policies of Inclusion vs. The Culture of Exclusion
Speaking up for women, however, is not easy.
In fact, it is always very difficult to speak for the ones who are excluded—be they women, people of color, the poor, the immigrants, the marginalized sexual communities.
Why?
Because the ones who have excluded them are most probably the ones who are in power.
So, your job is to make the people who’ve built their power by developing a culture of exclusion to start implementing policies of inclusion.
Of course it’s not going to happen very soon.
But it must happen—and Melinda Gates is all about putting the wheels in motion today!

“No-Drama Discipline PDF Summary”
Yesterday, we told you something about 
; and the day before that, we allowed Esther Wojcicki to teach you 
.
Well, consider this book the illegitimate child of the two: it is Daniel Siegel teaching parents how to discipline their children.
Introduction: Relational, Low-Drama Discipline: Encouraging Cooperation While Building a Child’s Brain
The word “discipline” comes directly from the Latin word 
, which was used as far back as the eleventh century to mean teaching, learning, and giving instruction.
After all, the root of the word “discipline” is 
, which means “student,” “pupil,” and “learner.”
However, for modern parents, the word discipline seems to have taken another meaning, as in the sentence: “I’m doing a lot of teaching with Sam, but when do I start disciplining him?”
But when your child misbehaves, what do you want to accomplish through your actions? Is spanking the objective or should spanking merely teach him/her a lesson about something else? Surely, it is the latter: the objective of discipline is still not merely 
, but 
.
Now, there’s a problem with this: as practically any parent you’ve ever met would tell you, it doesn’t really work.
The good news?
Well, unlike previous generations, we now have better models for disciplining – in the right sense of the word. And this is because we now know that “the way to help a child develop optimally is to help create connections in her brain—her whole brain—that develop skills that lead to better relationships, better mental health, and more meaningful lives.”
Put simply, our words and actions quite literally change the behavior of our children, and that’s because our children’s brains will 
 change because of them.
And that’s the goal of the no-drama discipline advocated by Daniel J. Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson. It’s a model of parenting which revolves around the motto “say no to the behavior, but yes to the child” via a very simple “connect and redirect” strategy.
It’s time to say goodbye to the act-react disciplining cycle!
Read ahead to learn how!
Chapter 1: ReTHINKING Discipline
As we said above, the word “punishment” shouldn’t be synonymous with “discipline.” 
Paradoxically, that is precisely the reason why Siegel and Bryson chose it: they wanted to reframe the whole discussion, to reclaim the word “discipline” along with its original meaning, to inspire caregivers to start thinking of discipline as “one of the most loving and nurturing things” they can do for kids.
And the first lesson is this: there’s no such thing as one-size-fits-all discipline.
Really, you ask? What about spanking and time-outs? They have stood the test of time and have been around since the dawn of times!
Well, the reason why spanking and time-outs have stood the test of time is pretty much synonymous with the problem: these are autopilot reactions.
In other words, if your child misbehaves, the very first words that come to your mind are “Go to your room and think about this;” if it’s something more serious, then you skip the words and proceed to the spanking; sometimes, it’s both.
Either way, it’s not rocket science: it’s the very basic, most primitive reactions available at your disposal.
The problem is that this inspires your kid to do the same; his/her action causes an immediate reaction of yours; your reaction, in turn, causes your child to autopilot-react as well.
That’s why it never actually learns anything.
There’s a better way, of course!
Instead of reacting—lecturing, spanking, timing-out—you could just take a moment and ask yourself three simple questions:
#1. Why did my child act this way?
#2. What lesson do I want to teach in this moment?
#3. How can I best teach this lesson?
Since every child and situation are different, the answers will differ from case to case. 
But, after all, that is pretty much the point!
Chapter 2: Your Brain on Discipline
Have you ever heard of the phrase “neurons that fire together, wire together”? 
If not, it describes something 
, according to which “when neurons fire simultaneously in response to an experience, those neurons become connected to each other, forming a network. And when an experience is repeated over and over, it deepens and strengthens the connections among those neurons.”
This is colloquially known as neuroplasticity and has enormous ramifications in terms of parenting.
Because, as Siegel and Bryson note, “if repeated experiences actually change the physical architecture of the brain, then it becomes paramount that we be intentional about the experiences we give our children.”
Let’s illustrate this a bit better.
Liz and Tim have two children: Vera, a seven-year-old, and Nina, a four-year-old. For convenience’ sake, it makes sense for Tim to take Nina to school and Liz—Vera.
However, one day, Nina rebels: “You took Vera yesterday! I want you to take 
 today.” Liz tries to explain away her reasons: “I know, sweetheart. That’s because Vera’s school is right by my work.”
This, expectedly, doesn’t get to Nina and, in a few minutes, the situation boils over: after a few shouts and screams—and maybe even a slap—Nina is forced to go with Tim and cries all the way to school, and Liz’s day is ruined from the morning.
What Liz should have done?
Firstly, she should have asked herself the three questions introduced above. Secondly, she should have hugged Nina. Finally, she should have offered her a choice: she can go to school alone or with her dad.
Why this would work?
Because spanking and shouting engage the downstairs brain (the amygdala); and it doesn’t learn. Hugs and thinking, on the other hand, engage the upstairs brain; it learns and changes.
Chapter 3: From Tantrum to Tranquility: Connection Is the Key
Before going on, let’s sum up the things discussed so-far in merely a few sentences.
Science has taught us that our children’s brains are 
, 
, and 
. In simplified terms, they consist of two sections: the downstairs brain, and the upstairs brain. The downstairs brain is the reptilian one; the upstairs the human one.
Now, most parenting techniques are 
: they are merely reactions to some actions, and engage the downstairs brain of the child; thus, they encourage him/her to counteract.
There’s a better way!
It’s called 
 parenting, and it consists of two steps: connecting and redirecting. Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 analyze the art of parent/child connecting.
Now, 
connecting?
For three reasons:
#1. Connection moves a child from reactivity to receptivity
#2. Connection builds the brain
#3. Connection deepens the relationship with a child
And this is true even in the worst-case scenarios, i.e., tantrums:
Chapter 4: No-Drama Connection in Action
Now, that’s connection in theory. 
This is how it looks in practice.
First, let us look over three No-Drama connection principles that set the stage and allow for connection between parent and child.
Remember the sound of 
? 
Play it over a video depicting a man walking through a beautiful forest to the ocean, and the peaceful scene would suddenly become more than threatening!
Well, that’s exactly how phrases such as “Go to your room!” “Because I said so!” or “Here we go again” sound to your child. How about switching to something more akin to “You seem disappointed about this grade”?
“One of the worst by-products of shark music,” write Siegel and Bryson, “is the parental tendency to make assumptions about what we perceive to be obvious.”
Sherlock Holmes would be the first to differ: “It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data,” she famously says. “Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.”
So, instead of blaming and criticizing (“What did you do this time?”), you should instead consider chasing the deep and profound 
 (“What happened here?” “I wonder what you two were aiming for this time!”)
The third connection principle focuses on the way you 
 interact with your children. 
It challenges you to consider the way you talk to your kids when they’re having trouble managing themselves or making good decisions. 
 you say to your kids is, of course, important. But you know that just as important, if not more important, is 
 you say it.
In other words, even orders such as “Get in your car seat!” if told with a Jim Carrey voice and a Monster-Mash face, can sound wacky and alluring!
The No-Drama Connection Cycle looks something like this:
Let’s see what it means in practice.
Communicating comfort is the basic (and, in most cases, the foremost) connection strategy; it is primarily non-verbal and, most powerfully, it is expressed through a loving touch.
When your child is sad for missing a playdate, you shouldn’t react the way you’re automatically inclined to – by dismissing the importance of the event. On the contrary, in fact: you must validate it before moving on with the other strategies. In other words, instead of saying, “What’s the big deal about missing a playdate?” say, “I understand that you’re sad. You really wanted to go.”
This one’s pretty much self-explanatory: talking often compounds the problem; so, be quiet for some time and just listen.
Reflecting what you hear is similar to validating, but it differs in that in the fourth connection strategy, you focus specifically on what your kids have actually told you. 
Chapter 5: 1-2-3 Discipline: Redirecting for Today, and for Tomorrow
Now, that you’ve learned how to 
 with your child, it is time to learn how to redirect his/her behavior in the desired direction.
In “Chapter 5,” Siegel and Bryson go over the redirection basics, helping readers remember one definition of discipline (to teach), two key principles (wait until your child is ready, and be consistent but not rigid), and three desired outcomes (insight, empathy, and repair).
No-Drama Discipline is all about teaching, and that is because all discipline 
 be about teaching, and not about consequences.
So, instead of immediately giving consequences (“I can’t believe you’ve stolen my cigarettes! No going out for a month!”), you should initiate a conversation (“Can you tell me something more about my cigarettes?”)
Only in the second case, you can hope that you and your child will learn something; in the first case, things might just go worse, because “downstairs-brain reactions” breed “downstairs-brain reactions.” It’s as simple as that.
The two main principles when redirecting your kids encourage cooperation and make life easier for both your children and you. 
These principles are #1: wait until your child is ready, and #2: be consistent, but not rigid.
In essence, they mean that you shouldn’t rush anything and that instead of rigidly commanding and demanding (“You can’t talk to me that way! You’re in a lot of trouble now!”) you should give your child practice doing the right thing (“Let’s have a do-over. I know you can say that again in a more respectful way.”)
If you’ve read Dan Siegel’s 
and
, you’re already familiar with this simple equation: insight + empathy = mindsight.
In other words, “when we ask our children to consider their own feelings (using personal 
) while also imagining how someone else might experience a particular situation (using 
), we are helping them develop mindsight.”
You can learn more about mindsight if you read the summaries linked above, but, explained most simply, “mindsight is the ability to see our own mind, as well as the mind of another. It allows us to develop meaningful relationships while also maintaining a healthy and independent sense of self.”
And that’s what you’re aiming with your kid, aren’t you?
Chapter 6: Addressing Behavior: As Simple as R-E-D-I-R-E-C-T
Chapter 6 “concentrates on specific redirection strategies you can use for achieving the immediate goal of eliciting cooperation in the moment, and for teaching kids about personal insight, relational empathy, and taking steps toward making good choices.”
Siegel and Bryson have made an effort to organize these strategies in an acronym which spells their goal: R-E-D-I-R-E-C-T.
The last thing a child needs is a long lecture about their mistakes; so, resist the urge to overtalk.
“We want to say yes to our kids’ desires,” write Siegel and Bryson, “even when we need to say no to their behavior and redirect them toward appropriate action.” 
So, don’t squelch emotions saying things like “I know you don’t hate your brother;” say something like “OK, you feel like you hate your brother, but let’s talk about other ways to express this.”
What kids need is for their parents to redirect them, “helping them recognize the bad decisions they’re making and what leads up to those decisions, so they can correct themselves and change whatever needs to be changed.”
In other words, instead of preaching along the lines “If everyone put the shoes at the front door, it would be a mess: put your shoes away,” use a mere description which says even more under the surface: “I see shoes at the front door.”
“When children are involved in the process of discipline,” inform Siegel and Bryson, “they feel more respected, they buy into what the parents are promoting, and they are therefore more apt to cooperate and even help come up with solutions to the problems that created the need for discipline in the first place.”
The lesson: parents and children should work as a team to figure out how best to address disciplinary situations.
That starts with a 
which doesn’t start with “You don’t know what you’re doing and saying,” but with a question: “What could you do next time you’re mad?”
Most parents use a “no” even though a “conditional yes” is also a possibility and 
 helps. Transform the “No, we can’t stay” into “Of course you can have more time with Nana,” with a simple time-conditioned question: “How about this weekend?”
We all know how to scold negative behavior, but very few of us really encourage positive traits in our children.
And it’s fairly easy to do that: just catch your kid behaving well, and emphasize that to create synaptic networks inside her/his brain.
Remember: your kids are 
; in other words, they like games more than almost anything in the world.
So, start masking the orders (i.e., the things they 
 do) into games (i.e., playful, creative ways to spend the time).
Need an idea?
How about, instead of saying “Get in your car seat right now!” you say something like “Please, please don’t sit in that car seat because Jimmy Jimmerino is already sitting there!”
Of course, Jimmy Jimmerino is your imaginary friend (who, we feel, will make quite a few appearances along the way).
The final redirection strategy, say Siegel and Bryson, is perhaps the most revolutionary. 
Why?
Because it involves you teaching your children the things they taught you throughout this book.
Think of it this way: the earlier your child learns to tell the difference between downstairs and upstairs brain, the earlier it too can become an active participant in the No-Drama Discipline school of parenting.
That will certainly allow you to skip a few steps.
Conclusion: On Magic Wands, Being Human, Reconnection, and Change: Four Messages of Hope
The book’s concluding chapter offers four messages of hope intended to help you take the pressure off yourself as you discipline.
These are:
#1. There Is No Magic Wand
#2. Your Kids Benefit Even When You Mess Up
#3. You Can Always Reconnect
#4. It’s Never Too Late to Make a Positive Change
Don’t forget these four messages of hope and solace—especially not in those difficult moments you’ll inevitably face at one time or another as you discipline your children.
“Even with the best ambitions and the most intentional methods,” conclude Siegel and Bryson, “sometimes everyone walks away from a disciplinary interaction feeling angry, confused, and frustrated.”

Twenty Discipline Mistakes Even Great Parents Made
Keeping these twenty mistakes in mind can help us to avoid them or to step back when we start heading down the low parenting road:
#1. Our discipline becomes consequence-based instead of teaching-based.
#2. We think that if we’re disciplining, we can’t be warm and nurturing.
#3. We confuse consistency with rigidity.
#4. We talk too much.
#5. We focus too much on the behavior and not enough on the why behind the behavior.
#6. We forget to focus on how we say what we say.
#7. We communicate that our kids shouldn’t experience big or negative feelings.
#8. We overreact, so our kids focus on our overreaction, not their own actions.
#9. We don’t repair.
#10. We lay down the law in an emotional, reactive moment, then realize we’ve overreacted.
#11. We forget that our children may sometimes need our help making good choices or calming themselves down.
#12. We consider an audience when disciplining.
#13. We get trapped in power struggles.
#14. We discipline in response to our habits and feelings instead of responding to our individual child in a particular moment.
#15. We embarrass our kids by correcting them in front of others.
#16. We assume the worst before letting our kids explain.
#17. We dismiss our kids’ experience.
#18. We expect too much.
#19. We let “experts” trump our own instincts.
#20. We’re too hard on ourselves.
The Eight Basic Principles of No-Drama Discipline
If you want to avoid the twenty mistakes above, you need to start practicing the no-drama discipline, which is founded upon eight basic principles:
#1. Discipline is essential.
#2. Effective discipline depends on a loving, respectful relationship between adult and child.
#3. The goal of discipline is to teach.
#4. The first step in discipline is to pay attention to kids’ emotions.
#5. When children are upset or throwing a fit, that’s when they need us most.
#6. Sometimes we need to wait until children are ready to learn.
#7. The way we help them be ready to learn is to connect with them.
#8. After connecting, we redirect.

It was Daniel Pink who taught us that

Unlike

“The Only Negotiating Guide You’ll Ever Need PDF Summary”
In a research study of university studies conducted about a decade ago, more than a third of the participants answered that they seldom or never negotiate.
The truth is, however, quite the opposite:
That’s why you need a negotiating guide. And 
—not just because of the title—is one of the best ones you’ll find on the market.
It is conveniently divided into two parts: “The Skillful Negotiator” and “101 Tactics for Successful Negotiation.” As the titles themselves suggest, the first part is mainly theoretical and explains the basics of negotiation, while the second one is practical and goes over what this means in practice.
Part I: The Skillful Negotiator
As we pointed out above, “most of us are involved in negotiations to one degree or another for a good part of any given day.”
Consequently—and contrary to popular opinion—negotiation tactics should never be considered anything less than “a positive way of structuring the communication process.”
In other words, as Gerard I. Nierenberg—justly dubbed “The Father of Negotiation Training” by 
—said a few decades ago: “in a successful negotiation, everybody wins.”
And that feels like a good place to start our summary!
, any negotiation you take part of can end in only one of four (
 five) possible outcomes: lose-lose, win-lose, win-win, or no outcome (no consequences, negative or positive).
Needless to say, lose-lose
is the least desirable outcome. 
Unfortunately, it is also one which often happens. 
Stark and Flaherty point to the June 2016 grocery workers strike against the supermarket chains Ralphs and Albertsons, which ended with them accepting 35% cut to their pensions, and Ralphs and Albertsons losing $1.5 billion in sales and about 30% of the market.
Win-lose or lose-win
is the outcome everybody secretly hopes for—that is, if you end up on the winning side. 
Of course, if you are capable of doing that, you might not be interested in any other outcome. However, even so, in the long run, win-lose doesn’t work as well as you think. And that’s because when you create a win-lose situation, the loser will most likely refuse to negotiate with you again in the future.
“Almost all win-lose relationships end up lose-lose over time,” say Stark and Flaherty.
The ideal outcome is, of course, win-win, i.e., the outcome when the needs of both parties are met.
You might think this sounds like something taken out of a fairytale, but it is not: win-win is quite a possible outcome and is best in both the short and the long run.
As an example of this kind of outcome, Stark and Flaherty point to Barack Obama successfully normalizing relations between the US and Cuba after half a century.
Everybody won in the end.
“After years and years of failed negotiations,” Stark and Flaherty write, “both countries were granted release of their prisoners. Americans and Cuban Americans are free to travel to Cuba. The Cubans will significantly benefit from the travel and trade revenue that is brought to their country from the United States.”
This is the final possible outcome: the lack of one. Neither party wins or loses—everything remains just the way it was at the beginning.
A great example of negotiating “no-outcome” is you selling your car. Your buyer doesn’t agree with your estimation, you don’t agree with his/her offer. As a result, he walks out, and you try to find another buyer.
Of course, every “no outcome” can evolve into a “win-win” or “lose-lose” outcome. For example, if you find a buyer willing to give you more money, you’ll see the “no outcome” as a preparation for a “win-win” scenario. 
However, if, after several buyers unwilling to commit, you realize that the offer of the first one was the best one, you’re heading toward a “lose-lose” outcome as a direct consequence of the previous “no outcome.”
“Some negotiators,” write Stark and Flaherty, “have a strong reputation for consistently achieving win-win outcomes in their negotiations.”
If you want to become one of them, then it’s best to keep the following three guidelines in mind:
Whether you’re negotiating with your spouse or a
seller, focusing on just one issue is one of the worst things you can do during a negotiation. It almost inevitably sets the scene for a win-lose outcome.
No matter what the negotiation subject, there are always more 
to be considered. And the more issues are on the table, the more chances there are for both sides to juggle them into a “win-win” outcome.
For example, if you’re buying something and negotiating only the price, there’s a good chance one side will lose the bargain. However, if you bring up additional deal points to negotiate (delivery date, financing, upgrades, warranty, training, and support), you might get yourself a deal.
The interesting part: all of the things put in the parenthesis above contribute to the overall “price” of the product; and yet, people narrow themselves down to one issue in most negotiations.
Everything other than this attitude inevitably leads to a win-lose situation. 
Don’t ever start a negotiation with the idea that your gain is your counterpart’s loss and vice versa. First of all, the market is never that rational or simple, and, secondly, it is not a good feeling to end up on the losing side.
It is not only important to 
 assume that your counterpart has the same needs as you, but it is also important to assume that you don’t know his/her needs.
It’s quite common for negotiators to make this mistake, simply because sometimes
.
For example, a seller might assume that his/her buyer wants to buy the product or service in question at the lowest price possible, but what if his/her actual need is, in this case, quality or status?
That’s a missed opportunity for a “win-win” outcome, right there!
“The three most critical elements in negotiation,” inform us Stark and Flaherty, “are time (the period over which the negotiation takes place), information (the more you have, the better), and power (which comes in many forms).”
Most negotiations, just like almost everything in life, are a process. 
And, once again, just like most things in life, they seem to adhere to the Pareto principle, with over 80 percent of your results in a negotiation generally agreed upon in the last 20 percent of the time.
If you want to bring time to your side of the table during a negotiation, it is smart to follow these simple guidelines:
About half a millennium ago, Francis Bacon noted that “knowledge is power,” and there is nothing truer than this as far as negotiations are concerned.
The more you know about the topic being negotiated, the better the result. The less you know, the more susceptible you are to being on the losing side of a “win-lose” outcome.
A negotiation is not an event, but a process, which starts long before the actual face-to-face encounter. Be prepared.
Find out everything you need from anyone who has the facts and statistics, be him/her a friend of yours or a relative, a colleague or an acquaintance of your counterpart. Browse the Internet, check the archives, and never forget—your counterpart will probably do the same.
“Several types of power can influence the outcome of a negotiation,” point Stark and Flaherty, highlighting the word 
 in that sentence, “because if you have power but don’t use it, the power adds no value to the negotiation.”
According to them, there are ten types of power that need to be taken into consideration and that, unfortunately, can not only be used but also abused:
In addition to these types of power, they point out the five rules of power as well:
According to Stark and Flaherty, no matter what the subject of negotiation, there are three types of negotiators you are bound to come across: sharks, carps, and dolphins. 
As far as the sharks are concerned, there are no other outcomes but the win-lose outcome; and they are unwilling to end up on the losing side.
They live in a world of scarcity and think that it is important to win at all costs. That’s why, for them, it is vital to focus on the “kill.”
Carps too live in a world of scarcity, but their final objective is not to win but to minimize their losses.
They dread confrontation and are entering all negotiations with the idea that they will have to work hard to just maintain what they already have. 
Needless to say, when faced with a shark, the carps always end up being on the losing side.
The dolphins are the best negotiators because they live in a world of potential abundance: as far as they are concerned, negotiations can have numerous different outcomes, and not only two.
They are flexible and can change their behavior depending on the situation. In addition, they would try everything to swim around a confrontation, but if challenged by a shark, they are capable of responding swiftly and purposefully.
They are also quick to forgive, as well. So, if a counterpart, even if shark, shows any signs of cooperation, dolphins are capable of quickly switching from retaliation to a more cooperative strategy.
Part II: 101 Tactics for Successful Negotiation
As we said above, part 2 of 
includes no less than 101 tactics for a successful negotiation. And we mean literally “no less,” because, in the revised edition, there are also 20 bonus tactics included!
The tactics are presented in a uniform manner: each of the presentations includes a description of the tactic, an example, and a counter.
Of course, even listing the 101 tactics would go beyond the limits of this summary, so we decided to randomly choose three and sum them up in our “Key Lessons” section.
The good news?
Well, Peter Stark and Jane Flaherty have made all of the 101 tactics available for free: you can read everything about each one of them 
 and 
. 
Key Lessons from “The Only Negotiating Guide You’ll Ever Need”
1.      Negotiating Tactic #1: Is That Your Best Offer?
2.      Negotiating Tactic #10: Wow! You’ve Got to Be Kidding!
3.      Bonus Tactic #2: Giving Up a Future Draft Choice
Negotiating Tactic #1: Is That Your Best Offer?
This question—”Is that your best offer?”—is Negotiating 101. 
A great way to practice your negotiation skills is to simply get in the habit of asking salespeople this question. 
“You would be amazed how many times they will lower their price or throw in an extra benefit in response to this simple question,” write Stark and Flaherty.
Try it and find out!
Negotiating Tactic #10: Wow! You’ve Got to Be Kidding!
“Successful negotiators are good at acting surprised,” say Stark and Flaherty. 
And this is the way they usually express that surprise. It may seem silly, but, in the real world, it really has an effect. It makes your counterpart ask himself “What does he know (that I don’t)?”—even when he knows it’s merely a trick.
In fact, failing to act surprised when price or conditions are mentioned could result in something you don’t want: your counterpart taking advantage of you.
Bonus Tactic #2: Giving Up a Future Draft Choice
Everyone who watches the NBA knows what this means: gaining more at the present moment by giving up something in the future.
For example, if you really—
—want to watch the football game tonight even though you promised your girlfriend to take her out to a nice restaurant, maybe you’ll manage to by offering her this kind of deal: “OK. If you let me watch the football game today, I’ll take you out three times during the next week.”
We don’t guarantee it will work—but, hey, it’s worth a shot!

“The Only Negotiating Guide You’ll Ever Need Quotes”
Our Critical Review
One can’t be skeptical enough of books which promise to be “The Only Book” of their kind one will ever require, but a case can be made for the validity of the title 
for Peter B. Stark and Jane Flaherty’s primer.
Of course, you might need many more negotiating guides other than this, but we feel that this is the one you’ll always return to, because it works as a sort of a school book (the first part) and an encyclopedia (the second part).
Don’t let the print length fool you: there is much more here about negotiation than you could expect to be packed in 300 pages. Trust us."

The Awakening
Chelsea Handler’s search for herself and her “Year of Self-Sufficiency” started with Trump getting elected; otherwise, who knows if it would have happened at all!
Why?
Well, let’s go back a few years to a couple of weeks before the 2016 presidential election and see what Chelsea was doing on a rare windy fall night in Los Angeles.
“I went up to my bedroom,” she informs us, “opened up my sliding glass doors, grabbed my vape pen, and turned on some Neil Young.”
Then she laid on her bed in the dark, and watched the wind blowing her bedroom drapes around; and then she leaned on to hear the ruffling of the leaves, and watched the lanterns that hang from her backyard trees swinging into each other.
She thought: “If there’s an electrical fire, I hope the dogs will at least bark to wake me up.”
Because, overall, her thought was: “This is awesome. This is exactly what I’d hoped adulthood would be.”
What does that mean, you ask?
Well, it’s simple: 
But that didn’t happen, did it?
“I suppose I could blame my state of mind on the election of Donald Trump,” writes Chelsea Handler in the first chapter of 
, titled “Where Have I Been All My Life.”
You’d expect a “but” after the sentence quoted above, but Chelsea follows it with something entirely different.
“So I will,” she says.
And she goes on:
So, in other words, Chelsea was wondering what most of us were wondering about two years ago: how, on earth, did Donald Trump become a President and how did most of the world didn’t even know this outcome was even a possibility?
And that, right there, inspired Chelsea to do something she hadn’t done before: start a spiritual journey. Only she calls it “The Year of Self-Sufficiency” because she not only hates but despises the word “journey” – ever since 
ruined it a decade ago (“a manufactured relationship on a reality show is not a ‘journey’”).
But you know what she means.
Now, the first thing that came to Chelsea’s mind in the “torpor of despair” she had fallen in after Hillary didn’t become a President was a single word: “elitist.”
After all, it was the word everybody was using in all of the President-Trump-related explanations at the time. Apparently, “everyone in California and New York lived in a bubble” and “the election of this lunatic was a result of all of us not knowing anything about the rest of the country.”
That didn’t ring true for Chelsea.
After all, she had traveled all over the country doing stand-up for so many years and had visited almost every major and minor city multiple times.
Moreover, her father had been a used-car dealer, she didn’t have a trust fund, and never even went to college due to lack of money; not to mention: she worked as a waitress numerous times, and was “broke for seven years living paycheck to paycheck.”
So, what kind of privilege are we talking about here?
Well, precisely the kind you would expect a New Yorker or a Floridan to have: “I had created a life in which there was a zero-tolerance policy for any discomfort,” Chelsea writes.
“I did live in a bubble, inside a bigger bubble, which was inside an even bigger bubble. Three bubbles. Two assistants, two cleaning ladies (who are more like my nannies), a driver, a pool guy, a landscaper, a florist, a houseman.”
 “I had become exactly what I’d always wanted to be—an elitist,” Chelsea concludes.
And, of course, this revelation scares her immensely; after all, it means that she’s one of those people who have probably contributed to Trump being elected a President.
Cue: midlife crisis.
What gets her out of it?
Well, the first thing was a line she remembered from Viktor Frankl’s memoir, 
:
“it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.”
Why does Chelsea even know that line by heart?
Simply put, because she got tired, at an early age, of reading hard books (such as 
) and she wanted to hack the tests her father gave her to be sure she had read the books he had tasked her with reading.
Namely, Chelsea’s father believed that there was one line in every book which summed up the whole book. So, when Chelsea got to such a line (she refers to them as putter-downers), she’d stop reading the books and relate the line to her father, giving the impression that she had read the whole book.
But, now, one of these lines (the one quoted above) really spelled volumes in her mind: 
 she started asking herself, wondering 
And, suddenly, it all seemed clear: Chelsea was always “white, pretty, and Jewish,” always loved by many and never hungry, self-confident, “a lot of luck and a lot of privilege;” in other words, life was 
 actually difficult for her.
“My life 
a bubble,” she realized. “That’s exactly what it had become. A big vapid bubble.”
So, she decided to burst that bubble and start discovering herself.
The Journey
For Chelsea, the process of self-discovery (once again, sorry, Chelsea, for calling it a “journey”) includes learning quite a few pretty basic things (such as working the remote, picking up the dog’s feces, or finding the toaster), trying out a few new drugs and going back to the old ones (marijuana, ayahuasca), and becoming politically active. 
Let’s share with you some highlights.
In an episode of her 
 show, 
 – titled “Dinner Party: Getting School” – Handler interviews a neuropsychiatrist and researcher named Daniel J. Siegel. But you know him already, don’t you: he’s the guy who authored 
 and 
.
Well, just a few months after the election, this same guy becomes Chelsea’s first real psychiatrist.
Her first few sessions consist of Dan guiding her through meditation; of course, the rest of the time Chelsea talks of nothing else but Donald Trump.
“I was paying someone hundreds of dollars an hour to complain about Donald Trump, which seemed like the exact right move,” she writes. “I would have paid him double. I had definitely paid for far worse in my life. I knew people were getting sick and tired of my anger directed toward the 2016 election and the daily horrifying cabinet appointees, and Ivanka and that schmuck Jared, and that evil witch they called a press secretary.”
“I couldn’t wrap my head around the fact that Sarah Suckabee Sanders and Ivanka Trump had no morality or sense of obligation to the very sex they inhabited – to stand up and say, No more. I needed someone to let me vent, privately. I needed someone to help me harness my anger into something positive.”
Dan, however, was merely preparing the field for something far deeper than these kinds of superficial frustrations; and if you’ve ever been to a psychiatrist, you know full well what we’re talking about: childhood issues.
The first time Dan asked Chelsea about her childhood, Handler answered in a very disinterested manner: “my parents were kind of lame, I have five brothers and sisters, one of whom died when he was twenty-two, and my mom died a few years ago… but I’d rather talk about right now. 
?”
“
,” she adds offstage, “but I wasn’t about to admit that to a stranger.”
In time, however, she opens up and realizes something strange: Trump’s election got to her because she saw it as some sort of a recurrence of what had happened to her when she was nine, and her 22-year-old brother Chet died on a hiking trip.
How, you ask?
Well, in both cases, the world just turned upside-down for Chelsea.
Her brother Chet (the oldest of a family where Chelsea was the youngest – they were the bookends) represented practically everything for Chelsea.
She wasn’t that fascinated with her parents and, in time, Chet started representing much more than a brother: a father, a crush, a boyfriend. Hell, Chet was the first man she ever slept with – but not in a gross way, of course (it was when Chet was 13 and Chelsea had just been born!)
And he had told her, before going on the trip to get some rest, that he would never allow for her to grow up around people such as Chelsea’s parents.
Then, he never returned.
Chelsea doesn’t believe men to this day because of this: the first man she got emotionally attached to, lied to her about the most important thing ever; and didn’t keep his promise.
In a great chapter of Chelsea Handler’s memoir, she retells the filming of one of the episodes of her new 
 show in which she and two of her friends (Jenny Mollen and Dan Maurio) try ayahuasca in front of the cameras.
Now, before you take ayahuasca, it’s recommended that you cleanse. Chelsea, unlike her two friends, didn’t, and spent the night holding and comforting Jenny, while Dan was moaning on a mat in the corner of the room. 
In other words, while the two intermittently vomited and broke down, she was becoming more and more sober. Add to this a lot of crying and diarrhea, and, as Chelsea says, “the situation couldn’t have gotten any worse—the final blow being that it was all caught on film and would be airing on Netflix.” (Well, it already is: just watch the fourth episode of 
.)
Anyway, the next time Chelsea was advised to try ayahuasca on her own, and this time everything’s great: she is, unexpectedly, overcome with love for her sister.
Her conclusion?
“You have been a human doing, and we need to get you to be a human being,” says Daniel J. Siegel to Chelsea during one of their therapy sessions.
“It just sounds like something straight out of a therapist’s handbook,” Chelsea objected.
However, during the year of her self-sufficiency, during her post-Trump journey of self-discovery, Handler realized that Siegel was more than right: and that’s precisely what happened during her transformation chronicled in 
.
She sums up the experience in four great sentences:
“I thought I was nailing it, for a really long time. I spent my twenties wanting people to think I was great. I spent my thirties thinking people thought I was great. I turned forty, and I started wondering what I thought about me.”
Handler ends the book with a few pieces of advice which sound a lot as if taken straight out of the “Wear Sunscreen” hypothetical speech.
We’ll quote them in our key lessons.
Key Lessons from “Life Will Be the Death оf Me”
1.      If You Are a New Yorker or a Floridan – You Are Probably an Elitist
2.      Your Frustration with Trump May Be Related to Your Family
3.      Chelsea Handler Has Something to Tell You
If You Are a New Yorker or a Floridan – You Are Probably an Elitist
Chelsea Handler didn’t exactly live a privileged life for some parts of it – her father had been a used-car dealer, and she spent at least seven years making ends meet – which is why she failed to see that one of the reasons that Trump happened was her.
Namely, as she realized soon after Trump got elected, in her LA apartment, she did have a butler and two servants, and if that’s not elitist – what is?
Well, people in NY and LA scoffed at the very idea of Trump becoming a President because they were segregated in the privileged districts of America.
Your Frustration with Trump May Be Related to Your Family
Chelsea Handler was very mad after Trump won. So mad, in fact, that she started seeing a psychotherapist. Most of the sessions were nothing more than her ranting on and on about Trump being “a bag of psychological cement.”
However, he was also a catalyst for her unlocking her own bag of psychological cement: his election meant that the world had unhinged, and that’s exactly what happened to Chelsea when her brother Chet unexpectedly died on a hiking trip when she was 9.
She was reliving the greatest tragedy of her life; fortunately, this time, she finally realized who she was – and had been all along.

“This will be one of your favorite books of all time,” says Amy Schumer. “Through her intensely vulnerable, honest, and hilarious reflections, Chelsea shows us more than just her insides. She shows us ourselves.”
The opinion is shared by everybody from Gloria Steinem to Ellen DeGeneres, from Trevor Noah to Jon Favreau.

People, in general, are apt to build and cultivate relationships with each other. Being able to click with someone is a process that is so deeply entrenched in our mindset, that is almost impossible to break.
Don, delivers an ancient but practical guide related to the art of building fruitful relationships and explains the benefits springing from them.
Let’s dive right in.
Who Should Read “The Mastery of Love”? And Why?
The secrets of Toltec wisdom are embedded deep into the hearts of naguals who have inhabited the region of today’s central and North America for hundreds and perhaps thousands of years.
While dealing with the challenges of survival, they’ve developed a set of ideas that had guided them through difficult times.
With this in mind, we firmly believe that “
” is a good fit for the broader audience.
About Don Miguel Ruiz
 was born on August 27, 1952, and is best known for his eagerness to unpack the Toltec spiritualist philosophy.
He is also a bestselling author, who has written a couple of profound neo-shamanistic texts that revolve around ancient teachings. 
“The Mastery of Love PDF Summary”
Before the Europeans landed on the shores of what in the middle-ages was known as the New World, the Toltec had already earned the reputation of being 
 and 
 of knowledge. In recent studies and white papers, scientists have spoken of the Toltec, as a race.
In fact, they were scientists who contrived a society that was propelled by spirituality and knowledge. 
Over the course of hundreds of years, the 
 were compelled to keep this knowledge a secret from those who planned to misuse it for personal gain. During the European conquest, in particular, the 
 remained in the shadows, fearful of potential abuse of power.
Luckily, the fortune was kept alive and passed on from generation to generation despite being under constant pressure of new cultural tenets. Don Miguel Ruiz, himself a 
 from the Eagle Knight lineage, decided to lift the veil on the powerful practices and teachings of the Toltec.
The Wounded Mind
It is needless to say that we are all masters of our own little world. 
In the same way, societies have created their own heroes, villains, and people to be venerated, our own minds have the power to do the exact same thing. Among other things, we also attribute specific features to one group of people whose actions reflect their inner world.
Evidently, we’ve been doing this since the beginning of time, and it is nothing other than an attempt to master your own personality and define your principles.
It takes years for a person to reach a certain level of mastery. Also, this is in direct relation with the idea you have of yourself, so striving to form your own set of beliefs is at the core of the Toltec wisdom. 
It also helps you understand that all of us are masters, whether we are aware of it or not – it doesn’t matter.
Think of it this way – children get into a quarrel with their friends about something trivial, and they get angry. With time, that child becomes aware that neglecting the problem, or pushing it aside, doesn’t add to the problem-solving, not in the least.
So, as a response, the child instinctively strives to become the master of anger. You can apply the same process to almost any external phenomena such as:
When the fear of rejection or rebuff develops into something overwhelming, our mind is pushed into a state of confinement. It can no longer treat the wounds inflicted upon itself, and it is something that the medicine labels as mental illness. 
If you are into reading, you’ll come across some more specific terms such as schizophrenia, paranoia, Alzheimer’s psychosis, and others. Also, these diseases are a direct consequence of our mind’s impaired ability to heal the wounds, from the moment they surface. 
The mind is frightened to take action and decides to abandon the outside world while being driven by the notion of less suffering. 
The fear of getting hurt, can only be described as a fuel on the fire, or to use a more sophisticated term, it leads to the creation of a: 
. 
This system is the perfect breeding ground for lies, and it facilitates the process of becoming a liar. The goal is that eventually one day, that lie is going to become your deep-rooted reality, and no one would dare to question it.
– Don Miguel Ruiz writes.
As we pointed out, each of us creates or nurtures a set of personal beliefs that represent the foundation for the development of personal identity. But, we are also dragged into this big outside dream that creates the rules and sets the damn game. 
The big dream incorporates in itself the cultural values, the religious tenets, the laws, regulations, and the environmental rules. 
The question that troubles the mind of many is – Is this the right way to organize society?
When a human is born, his or her existence is intact and clear of emotional baggage. In other words, the human is healthy pretty much until it hits the age of four. Then, the first wounds begin to crop up, and as time goes by, the emotional wounds only become more painful and poisonous. 
Almost all of humanity will agree that the happiest moments in our lives are when we embrace the child-like behavior. 
The fear of being judged disappears, the idea of being rewarded also vanishes, and we are simply there to enjoy life and have fun.
The adults, already infected with the disease of denial, pass it on to their children like some badge of honor. And as we said, the emotional wounds only become more contagious as the child grows both physically and mentally.
Some might argue that the problem lies in the upbringing of children, but the real problem prevails in the programming of our minds.
With time, young toddlers lose their innocence and acceptance of themselves and replace it with a wide array of fears. The most symbolic one is the fear of rejection; brought to life by our ignorance and social brainwashing, to say the least. 
You can absolutely see how love and freedom are shattered in the presence of children, just by looking at them.
As grown-ups, we can all relate to the times when we were punished or reprimanded just for being too playful as kids. As if, it is bad to express your innate proclivity towards playing and expressing joy. It is impossible not to notice that the risk-reward system is corrupt to the very core.
“You are grounded” or being said something along the lines of that’s not how good boys/girls behave; is not very productive.
And no, we are not talking about gender roles, but the sense that something is right and something is wrong. 
When that poison becomes ingrained into our daily lives, the sense of injustice only grows bigger.
You are no longer a child, and you have to deal with the world. For instance, if you are in a relationship with an abusive partner, you’ll probably prolong your suffering by espousing the idea of you being the culprit for your partner’s misconduct.
As you become tolerant of abusive behavior, the world will inflict havoc upon you. 
You live in a dream, some might call it an illusion, but it’s more of a vision you have of yourself. That dream, or whatever name you want to affix to it, is only genuine to you, and only you. 
Not even your mother nor your closest circle embraces the same vision.
You have to acknowledge the fact that every dream is a form of life in and out of itself. Some might call it an apt description for one’s mindset, but it is more of a mix of emotions, experience, and hopes.
Apparently, it’s not easy to let go of the judgemental notions altogether, because it is more of a process than a one-time thing. 
To achieve mental victory, a person must tackle its inclinations towards exhibiting reactions and settle down.
You’ll often see and hear people who chastise themselves for minor mistakes and say things along the lines of:
Even though life just keeps on giving, the drama doesn’t seem to stop. 
Some call it a numbers game; with time, more positive emotions will overpower the fewer negative ones, but it’s not as easy as it appears. 
You cannot order your mind to think positively, and love when you have built-up this negative mindset, which acts in a very destructive manner.
In the process, you are not just hurting yourself, as these notions preclude you from forming strong bonds with other people. Nurturing positive relationships becomes more distant to you, as you delve into lies and denial.
The Creator of the Universe tells us to accept ourselves and not fall prey to the social norms of today.
Loving yourself in this world of madness is becoming harder and harder, despite all the inventions that made life easier for us.
Remember, there are is no right and wrong; there are no winners and losers; they are all in your head.
How to move away from this stalemate?
Start the next day with a prayer for self-love.
Key Lessons from “The Mastery of Love”
1.      Get ahold of yourself
2.      Build the perfect relationship
3.      The biggest demon
Get ahold of yourself
It might come as a shock to someone, but you are not here to justify your existence.
Expectations put up, on your behalf, should be discarded immediately as the level of success must never be gauged by your willingness to please society.
Build the perfect relationship
This lesson is not only in reference to other human beings, but it also conveys the meaning of being in peace with yourself.
Plunging into a productive discussion is the backbone of any relationship, and that’s precisely what you should be eager to apply.
The biggest demon
From today’s vantage point, we can all see that angels, demons, and saints are nothing other than a human creation.
 – being the biggest sin, was seen as the fast-route to hell.
But, we are all sexual creatures – built or made to create life on Earth, and there’s nothing wrong about engaging in sexual intercourse. Your body is smart, and it generates stimuli that are in line with your needs, society, on the other hand, cannot provide the same level of honesty when it comes to addressing your cravings.

Want to become a better parent?
Who better to teach you than Esther Wojcicki, respected educator and Mother of a Super Family?
Read our summary of her book and learn:
.
Who Should Read “How to Raise Successful People”? And Why?
is a parenting book, which means that it is aimed at parents, especially new parents. 
However, this is one book which should not only make the children better adults but also the parents better people.
But, then again, these two things should be connected, shouldn’t they?
About Esther Wojcicki
 is an American journalist, educator, and Founder of the Palo Alto High School Media Arts Program in Palo Alto, CA.
Considered one of the foremost educators of the 20
 century, she has won numerous pedagogical awards including the 2002 California Teacher of the Year by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, and the 2011 Charles O’Malley Award from Columbia Scholastic Press.
Known for “Moonshots: The Woj Way Pedagogical Philosophy (Trust Framework),” Wojcicki was awarded an honorary doctorate from Palo Alto University in 2013. 
is her first book.
“How to Raise Successful People PDF Summary”
“There are no Nobel Prizes for parenting or education, but there should be,” writes Esther Wojcicki in the first sentence of 
. “They are the two most important things we do in our society. How we raise and educate our children determines not only the people they become but the society we create.”
And there’s a reason why you should believe Wojcicki, or WOJ as she is known to many of her friends and admirers: she is not only a legendary educator and, unofficially, “The Godmother of Silicon Valley,” she is also, very official, the exemplary mother of a Super Family.
What does that mean?
Well, let’s just say that, in her family, you really don’t know who has achieved more.
Together with her husband, Stanford University professor of physics, Stanley Wojcicki, Esther has raised three exceptionally talented daughters: Anne (co-founder and CEO of 23andMe), Janet, a Fulbright-winning anthropologist, and Susan, YouTube’s CEO.

?
Read on!
The Childhood You Wish You’d Had
When Esther Wojcicki starts the chapter with the title above with “we all tend to parent the way we were parented,” one cannot be blamed for thinking that she had wonderful parents.
That is, however, not the case: “when I became a mother,” she goes on, “the one thing I knew for sure was that I didn’t want to repeat the mistakes of my parents.”
The oldest of the three children of two Russian Jewish immigrants, Wojcicki grew up in a family where religious beliefs and practices decided every aspect of upbringing.
If you know anything about Orthodox Jewish families, you certainly already know that, in this tradition (as, unfortunately, in many others), women have one clearly defined role: mother of the family. 
“That means women don’t need an education,” writes Wojcicki. “They only need to know how to take care of the children and their husband, and how to maintain a household.”
Case in point: when Esther’s brother Lee was born (on May 23, 1945, five years after her), she was told by her father something rather shocking: “Your brother Lee is a boy, and in our family boys are more important.”
Esther’s father wasn’t one who only talked the talk: he made this perfectly clear by walking the walk as well: while Lee was showered with presents and attention, Esther was merely watching from the sidelines.
“Part of what helped me cope,” says Esther in retrospect, “was the constant love of my mother; she was patient, never critical, and she made me feel important despite what my father had said.”
Unsurprisingly, much of Esther’s parenting philosophy is based on avoiding the mistakes her father had made and repeating the good things her mother had done.
TRICK Is the Trick
“I may have figured out a lot on my own,” says Wojcicki, “but I’m the first to admit that parenting would have been much easier with some guidance. So that’s what I’d like to offer you here – guidance,” she concludes.
And she writes:
Let’s look at each of these values in detail.
Trust
Just recently, we summarized David Brooks’ immensely important book, 
 
If you have already read that summary (by all means, you should), you are familiar with the depth and extent of the “four interrelated social crises of modernity.”
One of them is distrust, best exemplified by the fact that less than a fifth of millennials believe that most people are trustworthy – a serious  drop compared to the 1950s; and, yes – those surveys came after a great war!
“The digital age and the ease of transmitting information has resulted in a crisis of trust,” writes Wojcicki, “and it’s affecting the way we live and the way we parent.”
The problem?
If you want your child to grow up in a trustworthy adult, and if you want it to believe in his/her capabilities, then it’s crucial that you start believing other people.
Why?
Because only that way you’ll allow your children to start roaming freely and experience things, and prevent them from internalizing your distrust.
“As parents, we have to take ourselves in hand and trust that we taught our children to make good decisions,” writes Wojcicki. “We have to trust the basic goodness of people and the basic goodness of the world. And sometimes, our children can be our greatest teachers.”
Respect
The only subtitle of this section of Wojcicki’s 
is, really, all you need to know when it comes to respect: your child is not your clone.
Take, for example, Greg, “a genius in graphic design” who Wojcicki had the privilege of teaching journalism.
The problem?
Greg’s father was a physician, and his mother was a medical researcher. “The very last thing they wanted their son to become was some creative type,” informs us Wojcicki. “He was supposed to be a doctor, a lawyer, or – best of all – a scientist.”
Of course, since Greg was sixteen at the time, his parents chose his courses for him. And even though he wasn’t that great in his science classes, for some reason, these were the ones he attended.
After some time, this resulted in him feeling depressed, withdrawn, and disinterested in absolutely everything.
Fortunately, Greg overcame this and eventually became a well-known graphic artist and web designer who currently runs a successful company in Los Angeles.
However, another student of Esther named Lisa wasn’t that lucky: instead of becoming a teacher, she became a doctor (her parents’ wish) and is still unhappy. 
And if you have ever watched 
, you know that these kinds of stories may end even worse than this.
“Children will listen to you – they want your approval and love – but if they want to be happy, they’re going to have to listen to themselves,” says Wojcicki.
That’s what she did after her daughter Anne announced to her that she had no intention of pursuing a professional career (after graduating from Yale!) and wanted, instead, to become a babysitter.
Esther allowed her daughter to lead the way, and, eventually, it paid off: 
.
Independence
Trust and respect are the foundation of the third trait of good parenting: independence:
“Children who learn self-control and responsibility early in life are much better equipped to face the challenges of adulthood, and also have the skills to innovate and think creatively,” writes Wojcicki. “Truly independent kids are capable of coping with adversity, setbacks, and boredom, all unavoidable aspects of life. They feel in control even when things around them are in chaos.”
Most of us think that independence is something children officially acquire after their 18
 birthday. However, this is a very wrong way to think about things.
Truly independent adults are formed in early childhood and to help them become such you need to follow two pieces of advice: 1) don’t do anything for your children that they can do for themselves; and 2) give your children grit.
If you know what we mean by 2, you have Angela Duckworth to thank for. And that’s because, in her succinctly titled 2014 book, 
, Duckworth revealed to the world something rather interesting: passion and perseverance are more important than innate talents.
In other words, the ones who make it are the ones who have set clear goals before themselves, and have the energy to stride toward their completion; even in Auschwitz, 
, the ones who survived were the ones with goals and determination.
Now, to give your children grit, you need to learn to allow them to do 
 they can do by themselves; even if you 
 help them.
Independence starts there.
Because with doing things inevitably comes failure to do some of them; and with that, just as inevitably, comes the determination to try again, aka grit.
In short, failure in early years results in grit; in later – in depression.
Collaboration
Julie Lythcott-Haims says that 
: authoritarian (demanding and unresponsive), permissive (undemanding and responsive), neglectful (undemanding and unresponsive), and authoritative (demanding and responsive).
We don’t need to tell you that neglectful parenting is the worst kind, but we feel that we do need to remind you that permissive parenting allows children too much.
And, as studies have demonstrated over and over again, children 
 some structure!
Psychologist Diana Baumrind discovered this in two separate studies (from 1971 and 1991) which demonstrated that children with demanding parents are less likely to become involved in drugs and similar delinquent behaviors during adolescence.
However, as described above, there’s a big difference between 
and 
style of parenting: the first one is the one practiced by Wojcicki’s father, and the second one the one advised by many psychologists in the world.
In other words, you need to be demanding of your child, but, moreover, you need to be responsive as well.
Esther goes a step further and introduces a new, fifth type of parenting: collaborative. It is the one in which the parent works with the child constantly, about all things and matters.
For comparison, an authoritarian parent would choose the color for his/her child’s bedroom and have it painted too; an authoritative one would choose the color and then instruct the child on how to paint it; a collaborative one, finally, would both choose the color and paint the bedroom with the help of his/her child.
“Collaboration means working together as a family, in a classroom, or at a workplace,” writes Wojcicki. “For parents, it means encouraging children to contribute to discussions, decisions, and even discipline… We shouldn’t be telling our children what to do, but asking for their ideas and working together to find solutions.”
Kindness
Let us start the final trick in the Parenting TRICK manual with a very enlightening quote by Wojcicki:
Now, let’s go back once again to David Brooks’ 
(we told you it is an important book, didn’t we?)
In it, the author expresses his deep concern about the future of humanity in the land of radical individualism: the United States.
We don’t even need to analyze why: individualists care for themselves more than they care for the ones around them; and communities are built on the very opposite: togetherness.
Wojcicki comments upon this sad state of affairs through the results of a study done by researchers at the Harvard Graduate School of Education: the Making Caring Common Project.
A survey of 10,000 children – mind you, children! – discovered that 80% of them identified achievement or happiness as their top priority, and only 20% said the same about “caring for others.”
But if everybody cares for himself/herself and not for others, then how are we going to build a human society?
Zoom in a little bit and the same goes for families: it’s either “one for all, and all for one,” or the demise of the nuclear family as we know it! 
Key Lessons from “How to Raise Successful People”
1.      The Trick of Good Parenting Is TRICK
2.      Independence Relies Upon a Strong Foundation of Trust and Respect
3.      Collaborative Parenting Is All About Kindness and Understanding
The Trick of Good Parenting Is TRICK
TRICK is an acronym which stands for trust, respect, independence, collaboration, and kindness.
And in Esther Wojcicki’s mind, it is also the simple (and, thanks to her, easy-to-remember) recipe for good parenting.
Independence Relies Upon a Strong Foundation of Trust and Respect
Distrust and disrespect breed distrust and disrespect; trust and respect breed independence.
It’s as simple as that!
If you don’t allow your child to roam freely and explore the world by itself (helicopter parenting), then it will certainly internalize this distrust and grow an untrusty parent itself. If you disrespect his/her choices, it may get even worse (this is one of the main causes of depression and suicides).
However, if you are trustworthy and respectful, your child will grow into just that kind of adult. And this is the difference between independent and needy children.
Collaborative Parenting Is All About Kindness and Understanding
Most parenting books advise authoritative parenting, which is different from authoritarian parenting in that it is both demanding and responsive (authoritarian is unresponsive).
However, Esther Wojcicki suggests a new kind of parenting: a collaborative one.
Collaborative parenting is all about the TRICK values; it’s doing things with your children 
by showing them how to do them, but by doing them 
 them.
It’s about showing kindness and putting the needs of your children first; finally, it’s about understanding that allowing your children to lead the way from time to time is the best thing you can do.
They might teach you things such as trust, kindness, and respect – you know, the trick to being a better person!

“How to Raise Successful People Quotes”
Our Critical Review
 should really be titled 
 because, throughout the book, that seems like Esther’s main objective. 
Unlike Amy Chou, Wojcicki thinks that a successful adult is just that: an independent, trustworthy, respectful, and kind person.
And her book will teach you how to help your children grow up like that; the successes of her children is evidence enough that her parenting methods really work."

Having problems making a decision?
Emily P. Freeman has a simple piece of advice: 
Just do 
.
Who Should Read “The Next Right Thing”? And Why?
Emily P. Freeman is a devoted Christian, so there’s a good chance that those who are not will find many of her recommendations and suggestions not only inapplicable but also even useless.
However, even they should be able to extract some guidance from this book. Even if merely the importance of the main lesson – doing the next right thing – that may be enough to make them more decisive.
About Emily P. Freeman
 is an American writer, creative director, and spiritual mentor.
Co-founder of the hopewriters.com community, Freeman has been writing online for over a decade.
In addition, she has also authored several Christian-themed books, two of which – 
 and 
 – topped the 
bestseller list.

“The Next Right Thing PDF Summary”
As Emily P. Freeman notes in the first chapter of 
,
“this is a book about making decisions.”
Consequently, it is also a book – as she adds almost instantly – “about making a life”:
Freeman invites you, as you read her book, to bring to your mind those areas in life where you do have a choice, no matter how small (
).
And also – to do the next right thing.
Do the Next Right Thing: The Wisdom of Jesus
In Luke 5, Jesus performs two well-known miracles: he cleanses a leper and heals a paralytic at Capernaum; and in Luke 8, he adds an even greater one: he raises Jairus’ daughter from the dead.
Now, after such miracles, you’d expect Jesus to have some very wise words for the cured (and 
, as readers), but the only things he actually says to them are: “Don’t tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest” (to the leper), “I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home” (to the paralyzed man), and “Give her something to eat” (to Jairus and his wife).
Emily P. Freeman thinks that there’s, in fact, an enormous amount of wisdom in these three very simple pieces of advice.
Why?
Because they all boil down to one universal remedy, 
 advice her book is built upon: 
.
“Rather than a life plan, a clear vision or a five-year list of goals, the leper, the paralytic, and Jairus and his wife were given clear instructions by Jesus about what to do next – and only 
” writes Freeman. 
And then she wonders if Jesus knew something about our “addiction to clarity,” and whether what he wanted to say to these people was something stated in The Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous:
“We earnestly pray for the right ideal, for guidance in each questionable situation, for sanity, and for the strength to do the right thing.”
In other words, most of us make our present choices based on a plan about the future; and quite a long and clear plan, indeed.
However, clear plans never work out, and none of us is capable of living in the future.
So, why don’t we start making decisions regardless of it?
Become a Soul Minimalist
“Minimalism is not that you should own nothing,” wrote Joshua Becker in 
. “But that nothing should own you.”
Well, Emily P. Freeman notes, this should not be read as merely 
, but also as a decision-making dictum.
No matter what choice you make in life, there’s a good chance that 
are not the one making it; in other words, that there are thousands and thousands of distractions which have influenced your decision.
Think of it this way: if you don’t know which brand of tissues you’re going to buy – studies have shown – you buy the one that first pops into your mind. The problem is that this choice has been imprinted in your brain by commercials and Google Ads, and quite a few cheeky psychological tricks the guys who make and place them know by hear.
In other words, you 
you’re the one making a choice, but, instead, your choice has been made by you.
How to change this?
Well, it’s not that difficult, in fact: just eliminate all the distractions.
Start with disabling notifications on your phone; that way, you’ll be more present in the 
 world, you know, the one 
 around you. Next, move on to phase 2: silence.
Unable to recognize the little voice telling you all sorts of things in the silence?
News flash: it’s you!
It was about time!
Name the Narrative
Now, silence and distraction-less surroundings are often not enough; and that voice inside you suggesting choices is not enough either.
Why?
Because that voice has been muffled out so very long time that it may be overwhelmed by the fact that it will finally be heard by the one person it should be heard by!
The effect?
Well, it may not sound clear, but rather like a tuned-out radio station. And we, Westerners, don’t like lack of clarity!
“Our Western minds are trained to go down the path of explaining,” writes Freeman. “We think if we can understand it, then we can control it… We are conditioned to believe the only reason we should do things is if we know why, where we are headed, and for what purpose. No wonder we have trouble making decisions. If we don’t have clear answers or sure things, then taking a big step feels like a risk at best and a wasteful mistake at worst.”
Freeman thinks she knows the problem:
Fortunately, the solution is rather simple: just name the damn thing!
“There is power in naming the unnamed things,” notes Freeman. “This is an important part of our decision-making practice and key to taking our next right step in love. Remember today is a plot point. See it honestly for what it is, but don’t confuse the moment for the whole story.”
Ask This Question Before Every Hard Decision
“Sooner strangle an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires,” wrote William Blake in his 
, warning everybody of something psychologists would discover much later: unacted desires turn into something bad and ugly, whether frustration, anger or fear.
In time, this results in something strange: your real desires are clouded by these negative feelings, and instead of embracing them, you’re actually running away from them.
That’s why, in the silence of your distraction-less surroundings, you should always ask yourself one crucial question before making any difficult decision: “am I being led by love or pushed by fear?”
You want an example?
Here’s one from the author’s life.
In 2011, Freeman was supposed to travel with the Christian aid organization Compassion International to the Philippines.
Now, she had a few valid excuses to turn down the offer: she was, for example, drafting two books at the time, and they weren’t going to write themselves.
However, there was something that bugged her: it seemed that these valid excuses were not the real reason why she wanted to turn down the offer.
And then, through a long and meaningful discussion, the trip leader from Compassion International helped Emily realize what was really happening: she had masked her love to participate in the mission with her fear of flying.
But merely naming it and realizing that it was a “fear vs. love situation,” gave Emily the necessary strength to do the next right thing.
“Desire often lives next door to grief inside the soul,” she concludes. “Access the grief, and you wake up the longing as well.”
Make the Most Important List
If “am I being led by love or pushed by fear?” is the most important decision-making question you should learn, then making a Life Energy List is certainly the most important decision-making activity you should start doing.
What is a Life Energy List, you ask?
Simply put, a Life Energy List is a review of the past quarter of your life, which should help you organize the next one.
It consists of asking yourself two questions:
• What gave you energy during the past three months?
• What left you without it during the same period?
You can use 
 to not only list the things you did in the appropriate columns, but also grade them accordingly (how much energy did each of one gave or took out of you).
Now, that you know – and in order to 
 know, you must be completely and utterly honest to yourself – you have more than a vague idea what to do and what not to during the next three months of your life.
And then?
Well, then it’s time for another Life Energy List.
Some Other Pieces of Advice
abounds with practical pieces of advice such as the five illustrated above.
The book has 24 short chapters, and almost each of them offers a different type of guidance (regularly coupled with a clarifying experience taken from the author’s life), with all of them pointing in the same direction: how to do the 
 right thing.
For the purposes of our summary, we chose to recap the five that seemed most interesting and applicable to us.
However, it would be a wrong idea to ignore the rest.
Here are a few of them:
• 
: enough with the self-help books and the mentors: paradoxically, your decision-making capacities are crippled by the plethora of instructions; even if they are good, they prevent you from actually 
 something; look at it this way: if most of your mentors are good, then there’s a better way than finding new ones: just choose one and follow him.
•
even better, gather co-listeners rather than gurus; people who listen are a rarity nowadays, so when you find them, be sure to never lose them (and, of course, to consult them whenever possible).
• 
: as we said above, sometimes things aren’t clear enough; however, rushing clarity is the wrong way to get out of these quandaries; be patient and contemplate things until they become clearer; and, if you are religious like Emily, wait for God’s signs (or
arrows, as
she calls them);
• 
: even if you’re not religious, sometimes clarity comes in all sorts of unexpected ways; some call them signs, others surprises; be that as it may, they are helpful; much more than going over the same things again and again.

 Right Thing
3.      The One Question You Should Ask Yourself Before Making a Difficult Decision
Everybody Makes a Lot of Decisions (on a Daily Basis)
We don’t need to tell you that you make an abundance of decisions throughout your life. 
However, have you ever wondered how much?
Well, according to conservative estimations, no less than 35,000. 
A day!
A Cornell University study discovered something even more fascinating: the average American makes 200 daily decisions on food alone.
Decision-Making 101: Do the Next Right Thing
Now, even though most of these 35,000 decisions are mindless, at least a few of them are life-changing; and, unfortunately, just too, too difficult.
What should you do?
Well, according to Emily P. Freeman – not to mention Jesus, the AA, or everybody from Mother Teresa to Martin Luther King Jr., from Theodore Roosevelt to Anne Lamott – it’s quite simple: just do the 
 right thing.
What does this mean in practice?
Quite simply, instead of putting things in perspective and deciding what you should do next in relation to your desired future in five or ten years, just do the next thing based on your present situation.
What if it is not clear enough, you ask?
Well, wait for it to clear!
The One Question You Should Ask Yourself Before Making a Difficult Decision
It’s quite simple, really: “am I being led by love or pushed by fear?”
In the silence of your room, shielded away from distractions such as Facebook notifications and mobile phones, this question is the right place to start thinking over every important decision.
You know why?
Because, more often than not, we mask our desires with negative emotions and don’t really know what we want on the go.

“The Next Right Thing Quotes”
Our Critical Review
Even though, as Kendra Adachi (founder of The Lazy Genius Collective) has justly noted, “Emily P. Freeman’s voice is gentle yet mighty,” most of her advices are either too Christian for the non-Christians or too well-known for the readers of other decision-making books.
Even so, 
“is a book you can go back to again and again” (Crystal Paine), for the simple reason that, sometimes, the most sensible piece of advice is the most commonly accepted one.
And “do the next right thing” is precisely that kind of advice."

Remember Olivia Newton-John?
Wonder what she’s doing now?
Let her tell you herself!
Dear readers, the long-awaited memoir of Australia’s sweetheart:
.
Who Should Read “Don’t Stop Believin’”? And Why?
The blurb says that 
should be “perfect for fans of Tina Turner’s 
 and Sally Field’s 
”
We’ll go even further: it should prove to be a great read for anyone who dreamt of becoming – or 
 – a Sandy in her/his own life after the 1978 smash-hit 
, and, well, for any music lover out there. 
After all, Olivia Newton-John is one of the best-selling artists of all time and has sold more records than, say, the aforementioned Turner, The Who, Stevie Wonder or David Bowie.
Naturally, don’t dare to miss this memoir if you’re Australian. Because, let’s face it, ONJ is nothing short of a national treasure.
About Olivia Newton-John
 is an English-Australian singer, actress, and activist.
A four-time Grammy Award winner, Newton-John has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling artists of all time. 
Eleven of her singles have been certified gold, two of which have been certified platinum as well; in addition, fourteen of her albums has received a gold certification: two of them have been certified platinum and another four double platinum.
Even so, Newton-John is probably most known as the protagonist in the musical 
, the soundtrack of which is one of the most successful soundtracks in history; in addition, the single (sung with John Travolta) “You’re the One That I Want” is the 14
 best-selling single ever.
“Don’t Stop Believin’ PDF Summary”
Heartwarming and engaging, humorous and candid, 
reveals Olivia Newton-John’s life story – as the blurb says – “from her unforgettable rise to fame in the classic musical 
 to her passionate advocacy for health and wellness in light of her battles with cancer.”
Consequently, basically any biography of Newton-John – say, 
 – is a sort of a summary of this book; it would be pointless if just run through the most important parts of her life as well because then we’ll probably sound just too factual and too boring.
And 
is anything but!
That’s why we opted for a different strategy, and, in continuation, we share with you the most interesting bits and pieces of Olivia Newton-John’s biography, taken from the early parts of her life, when she was not that famous.
Of course, if you’re interested in finding out more – you can buy the book! Or write to us to update the summary with the second half of her life.
Hope you’ll enjoy this one!
That’s Quite an Interesting Family You’ve Got There, ONJ!
When Olivia Newton-John sums up a brief stroll through her family history with the stereotypical “A lot to live up to!” you certainly wouldn’t expect that to be an understatement.
But, believe us, it more than 
!
Let’s start with Newton-John’s father Brinley “Bryn” Newton-John (1914–1992) who was a talented singer with a beautiful bass-baritone voice, and a Headmaster at Cambridgeshire High School for Boys when Olivia was born. 
Nothing special?
Well, to use Olivia’s words, he was also a “big force of nature and former MI5 agent.” Even more, he was on the Enigma project and was one of the guys who took Rudolf Hess into custody. 
 Rudolf Hess of “Adolf Hitler’s Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess.”
But that’s nothing compared to Olivia Newton-John’s remarkable family on her mother’s side.
To start with, Newton-John’s mother, Irene Helene, was a translator of a book of letters exchanged between Albert Einstein and Max Born, titled, simply, 
.
Max Born, in case you didn’t know, was a German-Jewish physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1954. 
Why is he important to be mentioned here in a separate sentence?
Well, in addition to being one of the greatest physicists of the last century, a friend of Einstein, and a dedicated celebrator of peace, Born was also Irene Helene’s father and, thus, Olivia Newton-John’s maternal grandfather! 
Now, Max Born was married to the daughter of the famous German jurist Victor Ehrenberg whose wife’s father was the founder of the historical school of law, Rudolf von Jhering.
Go even further back, and you’ll reach none other than Martin Luther, the guy who basically invented modern religion for most of the Western world!
“And there’s a Spanish king in there somewhere, too,” adds Newton-John.
A lot to live up to, indeed!
Olivia Newton-John Walked In Once on John Lennon and Yoko Ono
If you know at least something about Olivia Newton-John, then you probably know Bruce Welch.
Best known as a member of The Shadows, Bruce Welch often acted as Cliff Richard’s producer and wrote several of his and Olivia Newton-John’s hits.
He was also a fiancée of Newton-John for a while, and one of the co-producers of her first album, 
.
The other, in case you’re interested, was Newton-John’s long-time musical partner (and soon a member of The Shadows), John Farrar, who had just married Olivia’s singing partner from her Australian days, Pat Campbell.
Anyway, it was 1971, and 
was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. A frequent guest at the recordings was Newton-John’s dog Geordie who knocked the mic stand during the guitar solo in the title song. 
And you know what? If you listen carefully, you can hear it on the final recording!
Even more interestingly, in the very next studio while Newton-John was recording her first album, George Martin was recording The Beatles’ last album.
Bruce was friends with them, so Newton-John got to meet them all. 
And how close was Bruce to them?
Well, let’s just say that a few years before, Paul McCartney offered him a song. Bruce wanted to hear it first, and Paul played a few bars of the song to Bruce, who eventually turned it down.
“It had a different working title then,” says Newton-John, “but it was ‘Yesterday’!”
Oh, yeah, about the title of the section.
“One day,” informs us candidly Newton-John, “I walked in and found John and Yoko sitting around with their arms and legs entwined, young and in love. It’s a beautiful memory.”
If you say so, ONJ! Knowing them, we are not even sure if they were fully clothed.
How to Attract the Attention of a Young Olivia Newton-John
“It was exciting to have an album out and the next months went by in a blur of getting-to-know-you promotional appearances on television shows across Europe, the UK, and Australia, along with a stage tour,” writes Newton-John.
“Perhaps I was too young to handle it all,” she adds, “but I went down a path that I would later regret, which led to Bruce and me breaking off our engagement.”
After their breakup, Olivia went to the South of France on holiday with her friend (and then London roommate) Chantal from Australia. 
Chantal invited Olivia to meet her fiancé’s cousin, a certain Lee Kramer. They had a lovely summer night out, during which, at one point, he leaned over to her and told her: “You sure look better at night than in the daytime.”
“Well, he certainly had my attention!” writes Olivia.
Anyway, Newton-John was supposed to leave for London the next day, and, well, you know what they say, “Summer fling don’t mean a thing.”
Lee Kramer thought otherwise, though.
Let’s rephrase that: you know who was sitting next to her on her flight back? 
He would tell her many years later that he paid a lot of money for that seat. 
But he did get Newton-John in return: they dated for a few years during which he was also her manager.
Eurovision Coincidences
And during this year another interesting thing happened: Newton-John, then just 26 years old, was selected to represent the United Kingdom at the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest.
Olivia sang a different song each week on 
, with the public voting for their favorite.
The public eventually chose the song “Long Live Love” and fared quite good at the contest.
Now, the book says that she “came in third,” but we 
 and found out that, in fact, she shared the fourth place, behind Netherlands, Italy, and Sweden.
Yup, not that anyone had a chance to win that year: Sweden finished first because they sent ABBA and because ABBA sang “Waterloo” that year.
Not that ONJ minded: “I loved ABBA, and we became fast friends,” notes she in her memoir.
Anyway, even though her career was taking off, Newton-John’s personal life was in shambles: she broke up with Lee, and got back together with Bruce for a short time; but that didn’t work out either.
Interestingly enough, Britain’s representative at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1973 was Cliff Richard, and The Shadows (now with John Farrar) represented the UK one year later.
We don’t know this for a fact, but we’re quite sure that this has to be the only case in Eurovision’s history when two ex-fiancées and several (ex-)musical collaborators represented the same country in three consecutive years!
Star Encounters
“One of the interesting parts of fame is that you get to meet so many actors and musicians that you admire and look up to,” writes Olivia Newton-John. 
Here are some of those early encounters.
Once, when Newton-John was on tour with Paul Williams, she traveled with him on a private jet to each gig. And remember, these are the pre-Sandy 2 days still, so Olivia Newton-John was the “hopelessly devoted” nice girl everybody loved to love!
Well, that nice girl got into the worst whipped cream fight at 35,000 feet in the air and made a gigantic mess inside the private jet.
“Who was on that plane?” ONJ heard someone asking later on. “Led Zeppelin.”
“No,” they were told. “Olivia Newton-John!”
They couldn’t believe it.
When she auditioned for 
, Newton-John got to spend a day with none other but Dustin Hoffmann.
“He was really funny and suggested we just walk around one of the neighborhoods in Malibu,” she writes. “We talked about movies and life, and finally found ourselves walking up a long driveway by mistake. Imagine the homeowner who looked up, saw us and actually did say, ‘Can I help you . . . two?’”
“Oh, we’re looking for our lost dog,” Dustin riffed.
“Perhaps one of my biggest star encounters,” writes Newton-John, “happened at the Cannes Film Festival when I was just in my twenties.”
But this is one of those encounters that deserve to be quoted in full:
A few years later, Newton-John was invited to see Elvis at the Hilton in Las Vegas; next to her, on either side, Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Weber were seated.
However, even that meant nothing when compared to the shock which followed: Elvis saying Olivia’s name and covering her song “Let Me Be There.”
Backstage, she met the “warm and welcoming” Doris Day, but, unfortunately, didn’t get the chance to meet the King himself.
He had an emergency and had to, well, leave the building.
“I did hear later that Elvis told others that he was the one who told me to record ‘I Honestly Love You,’” Newton-John writes. “Not true. We never spoke! But I’m still so knocked out that he said my name.”
During her Japan tour, the young Olivia Newton-John had one of her “most eye-opening celebrity encounters.”
It was with Cat Stevens, and it happened in an elevator.
Stevens looked very handsome “with long, dark hair and a beard, wearing a gorgeous velvet shirt and beautifully tailored pants.”
He invited Olivia to his show, where she saw him “in torn jeans and a white, grungy t-shirt – so different from the elegantly dressed man in real life.”
But, as Newton-John concludes, that’s show business after all.
Key Lessons from “Don’t Stop Believin’”
1.      Olivia Newton-John Is a Descendant of Martin Luther and a Nobel Prize Winner
2.      ABBA Won the Eurovision Song Contest Olivia Newton-John Took Part In
3.      Bob Dylan Wrote Olivia Newton-John’s First Hit
Olivia Newton-John Is a Descendant of Martin Luther and a Nobel Prize Winner
Though her father was an MI5 agent who took Rudolf Hess into custody, Olivia John’s maternal family line is far more remarkable.
For a start, her grandfather was Max Born, a German Nobel Prize-winning physicist and a close friend of Albert Einstein, and her great-great-grandfather was one of the guys who founded the historical school of law.
More remarkably, Olivia Newton-John is a descendant of a Spanish king and none other than Martin Luther, the first Protestant in history.
ABBA Won the Eurovision Song Contest Olivia Newton-John Took Part In
Olivia Newton-John represented Britain at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1974. 
Though she says she came in third, the official results say that she ultimately finished fourth.
But, then again, they were all fighting for second place: the winner was ABBA’s “Waterloo,” widely considered the best Eurovision song in history.
Bob Dylan Wrote Olivia Newton-John’s First Hit
,
Olivia Newton-John’s first album – recorded at about the same time and in the same studio as The Beatles’ last – featured several covers of famous songs.
The title track, however, was a cover of a Bob Dylan song, already covered by George Harrison as well.
Interestingly enough, as ONJ would find out decades later, “If Not For You” was her husband John’s favorite song.

Want to be as hot as a Victoria Secret’s model?
What if it is not at all difficult?
Michael Matthews reveals the simple science behind it in his against-the-grain fitness manual:
Who Should Read “Thinner Leaner Stronger”? And Why?
is for all those women out there who have lost all hope that they will ever get the body of their dreams, after trying out every imaginable diet and paying $70 per hour for a personal trainer.
Michael Matthews says that it is fairly simple—you’re just doing it wrong. He promises that following his point-by-point advice will result in you dramatically transforming your body in just 12 weeks. And many claim that this book has delivered on his promise.

Michael Matthews’ 
begins with a straightforward promise:
Unsurprisingly, his book is a collection of common mistakes and busted myths supplanted by relevant sets of laws and rules which, if strictly followed, can lose you “10 to 15 pounds of fat in a breeze” and can get you “that ‘Hollywood babe’ body” in no more than three months.
Matthews believes that achieving this is “not nearly as complicated as the fitness industry wants you to believe” and that it is precisely because of the fitness industry that so many women have problems changing their bodies the way they like to.
Seems like a great place to start our summary, doesn’t it? 
When the Myth Brings You Money, Print the Myth
“I’m going to tell you something that the kings of the multi-billion-dollar health and fitness industry don’t want you to know,” writes Matthews at the very beginning of 
.
You don’t need any of their crap to get into shape and to look better than you ever have before.”
Meaning:
• You don’t need to starve yourself with super low-calorie diets;
• You don’t need to constantly change up your exercise routines;
• You don’t need to grind out hours and hours of boring cardio to shed your ugly belly fat and get lean and toned;
• You don’t need to spend hundreds of dollars every month on supplements or fat loss pills;
• You don’t need to completely abstain from “cheat” foods.
Then, why do so many people around you do all of these things?
In one word: 
Money.
Simply put, when people are willing to spend money on certain types of products or pieces of advice, then you can be sure that “there will never be a scarcity of new, ‘cutting edge’ things for them to empty their wallets on, and there will always be scores of brilliant marketers inventing new schemes to keep people spending.”
The truth is rather brutal:
Fitness magazines, for one, don’t want you to lose weight and get into the shape of your dreams, because, then, you would stop buying them.
What they want you is this: to buy not just them, but also the supplements they advertise. 
Because that’s where they get their money from!
To top this, personal trainers are rarely fitness experts, because all you need to do to pass the certification test is memorize some basic information about exercise and nutrition. 
Also, they never gave students nutrition advice, even though that amounts to about four-fifths of the equation for a great body.
The 8 Biggest Muscle Building Myths & Mistakes
As a direct result of the above, “nine out of ten people you see in the gym lifting weights don’t train correctly.” 
How would they?
They are usually doing nothing more but following worthless programs found on the internet or in magazines, or maybe a not-very functional exercise routine prescribed by their trainers.
Chances are that you have probably fallen victim to one or more of these false pieces of advice at some point in the past, and that you’re currently doing pretty much the same, i.e., playing the game of no gains or, in the best-case scenario, the game of “slow, stubborn gains.”
Well, Matthews would like to speed up the process for you by first busting the 8 biggest muscle building myths and mistakes.
Let’s hear it, Michael!
No matter what you do or how well you do it, you will never change the shape of your muscles. It is determined by genetics. 
Hence, the claims that some exercises create “long, lean” muscles, while others result in “bulky, ugly” muscles is a myth, unsupported by any known science.
Whether you do yoga or weight training, the shape of your muscles will remain the same, and the only thing that will change is their growth: weight training, of course, grows muscles faster than yoga, which, in turn, makes them more flexible.
All in all, you can have sexy arms and shapely legs—only not the very ones of your favorite model.
This myth is already addressed in #1, but Matthews is so irritated by it that he feels the need to repeat it. 
“
,” he writes, “
. Your body simply can’t do it. It lacks the hormones and genetic programming.”
Exercising too long on a daily basis leads to overtraining which, in turn, makes you lethargic and gives your body too little time to repair your muscles. Consequently, this can sometimes cause you to 
 muscles and 
fat.
The optimal time: 45 to 60 minutes of workout per day.
When your muscles are burning, what you’re actually feeling is lactic acid building up in your muscles, and that may be not as bad as it sounds, but it is not good either.
Not to go into detail, it certainly means that you’re doing yourself more harm than good.
“No pain, no gain”?
“One of the worst fallacies out there,” according to Matthews.
If you’re going to the gym to improve your muscle tone and get stronger, then you need to know that this requires three simple things: “lift progressively heavier weights, eat correctly, and give your body sufficient rest.”
The most effective muscle-building exercises are known as “compound exercises” (because they involve multiple muscle groups) and include the Squat, Deadlift, and Bench Press.
“Isolation exercises” such as the Cable Fly, Dumbbell Curl, and Leg Extension (which involve one muscle group only) are little short of wasting your time.
Unfortunately, most people don’t have a clue as to the proper form of exercises, and this doesn’t merely hold back their progress, but it also opens the door to debilitating injuries since it causes unnecessary wear and tear on ligaments, tendons, and joints.
Don’t be that idiot: exercise only what science says is helpful and beneficial.
OK, this is the other end of the spectrum: training without pushing yourself forward. That will, of course, never work.
Even though evolution works against you when it comes to your perfect body—everyone avoids discomfort in favor of pleasure and ease—if you’ve decided to go to the gym, then you need to put in the effort.
Especially when it’s difficult to do so.
As we said above, exercising is merely one part of the equation; the other is nutrition. And even the women who know this are way, way off when it comes to eating properly.
“If you don’t eat enough calories and get enough protein, carbs, and fats throughout the day,” writes Matthews, “your muscles simply don’t grow bigger or stronger. It doesn’t matter how hard you train; if you don’t eat enough, you won’t gain any muscle to speak of.”
The opposite is also true: “if you eat too many calories, eat bad carbs and fats, and don’t know how to proportion and plan your meals properly, you can gain muscle, but it will be hidden underneath an ugly sheath of unnecessary fat.”
The Real Science of Muscle Growth
Congratulations: you’ve just learned how to do it wrong! Now, it’s time for the more important part: how do you correctly go about building your muscles?
By never forgetting and always adhering to the four laws below, because, as Matthews says, they are “as certain, observable, and irrefutable as those of physics.”
The first law of muscle growth is one that needs explaining rather than merely stating. In other words, everybody knows that muscles grow only if they are forced to, but very few people know why.
Matthews explains.
It’s rather simple, really.
By lifting weights, you’re actually causing tiny tears (i.e., “micro-tears”) in the muscle fibers, which then your body repairs so that it is better prepared to handle the stimulus which caused the damage in the first place.
Consequently, if you’re not producing “micro-tears” in your muscles, your muscles won’t grow since they’d deem themselves adapted to your current needs. 
But, just as important, if you’re producing too many “micro-tears” in your muscles, then your body won’t be able to repair them, and this will hinder your muscle growth as well.
“For optimal muscle growth,” concludes Matthews, “you must train in such a way that causes optimal micro-tearing and then you must feed your body what it needs to grow and give it the proper amount of rest.”
As we said above, the feeling of “burning” in your muscles is not synonymous with muscle growth; it’s actually just fatigue in the form of too much lactic acid. 
Consequently, the burning sensation is not an indicator of optimum workout—it’s oftentimes quite the opposite.
The same holds true for the pump you feel when training. It is merely the result of blood being “enclosed” in the muscles, and, while not bad, it’s also not the primary driver of growth.
What is, then?
.
Overload always gives muscles a very clear reason to grow, which means that plain old heavy weightlifting is the best workout for muscle growth known to man.
And, contrary to what many trainers and magazines say, you don’t need to change your routine every week or two: you can do the above every day, and the results will inevitably show.
If you understood well the first law of muscle growth, you already know that muscles actually grow 
the gym. 
Inside it, you’re merely creating the “micro-tears” which your body needs to repair while you’re resting afterward; it is this “repair” the thing we term as “muscle growth.”
Consequently, working out too much doesn’t do you any good. Sleeping eight hours a day after exercising for no more than one 
Even if you do the perfect workout and give your muscles the optimum amount of rest time, if you don’t eat correctly, your muscles won’t grow bigger or stronger—period.
“Simply put,” writes Matthews, “your diet determines about 70 – 80% of how you look (muscular or scrawny, lean or flabby).”
Precisely because of this, instead of summing up the main points of the book, we’ve opted to share with you a few more nutrition-related insights from 
in our “Key Lessons” section.
We know you won’t mind.

2.      The Real Science of Healthy Fat Loss
3.      Setting Fitness Goals to Motivate Yourself
The 5 Biggest Fat Loss Myths & Mistakes
Just as there are muscle building myths and mistakes, there are myths and mistakes related to burning fat as well. Matthews dispels five of them:
Of
course it’s pretty essential to count your calories if you want to get fit! If you want to lose fat, your body must burn more energy than it receives through your food, and the energy potential of food is measured in calories. Consequently, eating more calories than you can burn through the day results in more fat. It’s that simple.
Not if you’re eating too many calories! Cardio enhances fat loss, but only to a certain point. If you eat 600 calories more than you need, jogging will burn only half of that, and you’ll still gain fat at the end.
The Atkins diet. The paleo diet. 
. 
… Well, how many diets are there? you wonder. Well, the truth is, there are only a few rules (see next lesson), and everything else is just a fad which makes some people serious money.
Being lean is not a matter of exercising: it is a matter of having low body fat. And it’s something you certainly won’t achieve with a routine based on low weight and high reps.
Fat can be reduced only via proper dieting, and not via isolated exercises targeted at spot reduction. And when it is reduced, your body will decide in what way. “Our bodies are all genetically programmed differently, and there’s nothing we can do to change that,” says Matthews.
The Real Science of Healthy Fat Loss
Now that you know the myths—it’s time you get to know the three fundamental laws of fat loss:
Getting toned has nothing to do with fads and magazine advice, and it has everything to do with simple biology and even simpler math: energy consumed versus energy expended.
Unless your metabolism is very fast, every calorie you give to your body that isn’t burned off turns to fat. If you give your body fewer calories than it can burn throughout the day, than it makes up for the deficit by burning its own energy stores, i.e., fat.
The bottom line: it doesn’t matter what you eat, as long as your calories are right.
As we just said, fat loss is much more related to 
you eat than it is to 
you eat. 
Since different people have different metabolisms, there isn’t one definite science-backed recommendation to take note of when it comes to your meal schedule.
Just adhere to the one which seems to work best for you based on your experience.
Even though cardio doesn’t equal burning fat, it does accelerate fat loss, and if your genetics isn’t on your side (fast calorie-regulating metabolism), it’s a nice way to get into the “super lean” category (15% body fat and under).
Setting Fitness Goals to Motivate Yourself
“This is so simple and clichéd that you’d think it wouldn’t need stating, but it does,” says Michael Matthews before stating the obvious: “Before you lift a weight, hop on a treadmill, or cut a calorie, you must have specific, tangible goals set in your mind as to why you’re doing it.”
Setting them is as easy as 1-2-3:
#1. Determine what your ideal body should look like; don’t just throw around adjectives: find a picture; after all, you don’t go to the barbershop without one, do you?
#2. Determine your ideal state of health. Matthews’ is along these lines: “o have a vital, energetic, strong, and disease-free body that lives long and allows me to stay active and enjoy my life to the fullest.” That’s motivating, isn’t it?
#3. Give yourself a reason to achieve these goals. Whether it’s being better at some of your hobbies or getting more attention from your partner—it doesn’t matter. Just give yourself one that will motivate you along the road. Because, after all, it is a long one.

If you want to lose fat and get the perfect body, what you need is a scientific method. 
And, unlike many other books on the subject, 
quotes quite a few studies and is adamant in its conviction that the science behind getting fit is both simple and translatable into practical routines.
We went over its basics above; if you want to learn more about the specific routines, you’ll need to do more than just look inside the book: you’ll need to 
 put Matthews’ advice into practice.
Many women say that this has worked for them.

: “
Who Should Read “Crushing It”? And Why?
As the title suggests, 
is the decade-younger cousin of 
, which means
if you’ve read that Vaynerchuk classic and loved it, then this is where you should be heading next.
Of course, the same applies if you’ve read and liked any of Vaynerchuk’s books we’ve summarized here, such as 
 
, or 
Perfectly suited for young and aspiring entrepreneurs.
Crushing It Summary
I: Get Pumped
In 2009, Gary Vaynerchuk—a name you’re certainly already familiar with if you know anything about modern business and marketing strategies—published 
.
Its promise?
In the words of Vaynerchuk himself, “to teach entrepreneurs how to monetize their passion by using social media to build a strong personal brand to attract customers and advertisers to their websites, as well as transform them into such trusted experts or entertainment figures that brands and outlets would pay them to talk, consult, and attend events”
In other words, 
was one of the very first books to suggest that 
 was the time to build a strong personal brand and earn money out of your own likes and dislikes—literally.
True, the book never once mentioned the word “influencer,” but if the description above doesn’t spell “influencer” for you, then you’re not reading something correctly. 
And 
!
Just a few relevant stats are more than enough to vindicate Vaynerchuk:
•YouTube’s daily viewership is closing in on TV’s 1.25 billion hours per day, as television viewership falls every year;
• One in every five minutes spent on mobile is spent on Facebook’s apps and services;
• Every minute, 65,900 videos and photos are posted on Instagram.
• Over 3 billion snaps are created each day on Snapchat, where over 60 percent of ads are watched with the audio on.
To put that in more practical terms, “even with only a thousand followers, an entry-level Instagrammer could earn about $5,000 per year with just two posts a week, and ten thousand followers could net almost $20,000 per year.”
“When it comes to professional opportunities,” Vaynerchuk notes, “this is the best time to be alive in the history of humankind.”
So, what are you waiting for?
“While it can be hard to pinpoint why some influencers build attractive, lucrative personal brands that succeed beyond their wildest expectations,” notes Vaynerchuk at the beginning of the second chapter, “it’s not hard to figure out why so many who attempt to do it fail.”
“In general,” he goes on, “it’s because they’re putting their energies into the wrong things. They care, but not enough about what really matters. And what really matters is a pretty short list: intent, authenticity, passion, patience, speed, work, and attention.”
Let’s have a look at all of them.
It all starts with your intent, aka 
. In other words, before doing anything business-related, ask yourself 
do you want to be an entrepreneur and/or why do you want to be an influencer?
If the answer is because of the money, then you can be sure, straight away, that you’ll fail. 
Whether it’s to share your knowledge or to help people, to have fun with a creative outlet or to create community, to build something that leaves a legacy or to make other people enjoy their lives more—these are all great reasons to start a business.
Making money is not.
So, center your activities around these three altruistic values: a commitment to service, a desire to provide value, and a love of teaching.
And Vaynerchuk promises—you won’t go wrong.
Your intent will immediately be reflected in your authenticity. 
True, sometimes fakes start off well, but the audience is pretty great in noticing fakes and, in time, they fail.
“Authenticity,” notes justly Vaynerchuk, “is a welcome relief to consumers who live in a society where they constantly feel that they’re being taken advantage of or hearing only parts of the whole story.”
If you’ve watched 
, you already know that this is where not only business, but actual, authentic life begins: with passion.
You know why?
Because things will inevitably get rough. And if you don’t have passion for what you’re doing, when that happens, you’ll probably give up.
“We’re on this earth for only a short time,” writes Vaynerchuk, “and the bulk of our adult days are spent at work. It’s worth taking the steps necessary to make sure those hours are as rewarding, productive, and enjoyable as possible.”
Here’s something they rarely tell you: the money won’t start flowing right off the bat. 
On the contrary, in fact: you’ll need to put in the effort for some time, almost without the benefit of an audience or, consequently, feedback.
And even when the money eventually comes, you need to invest it back in your business to make it grow.
Many people are impatient, and they spend it straight away on watches, suits, and all kinds of flash, thus robbing themselves of the opportunity to do something better for the long term.
Don’t be one of those people: be patient.
It might seem strange to follow up on patience with speed, but Vaynerchuk is quick to point out that this isn’t a contradiction.
And that’s because while patience is for the long term, speed is for the short term.
In other words, the world is spinning fast nowadays, so gravitate toward things that will make you more efficient and allow you to do your work faster.
Because, if you don’t do it today, someone else will.
You need to be constantly in the mode, says Vaynerchuk, even if that means making a lot of mistakes.
“Being unafraid of making mistakes makes everything easy for me,” he writes, channeling his inner Wayne Gretzky. “Not worrying about what people think frees you to do things, and doing things allows you to win or learn from your loss—which means you win either way. Hear me now: you are better off being wrong ten times and being right three than you are if you try only three times and always get it right.”
This lesson is so important that it’s bolded in the book: when you first start out, there is no time for leisure.
That’s why entrepreneurship is a young man’s game: you need a lot of stamina to get your business and your personal brand off the ground.
You’re never too young to start.
As we said above, things are changing fast today, so it’s your mistake if you get too comfortable on one platform and stop developing solid skills on the others.
You have to pay attention to everything: trends, controversies, scandals, other influencers, and entrepreneurs.
Remember the time when you weren’t sure if you wanted to open an account on Instagram? 
Well, people were already mastering it at the time.
They may be millionaires today.
Speaking of mastering things—there’s apparently one you don’t really need to master. And that one is the eighth thing that matters, the eighth essential: content.
Too many people think that they’ll never master editing, camera work, lighting, movements, or writing style. And that’s why they never start producing content.
However, that’s 
how the world of influencing works: all you need to do is keep producing high-quality content, and with high consistency.
Much better than waiting to master Adobe Premiere to start producing it, is to just start documenting your life, just like Vaynerchuk does (he employs a videographer who films almost everything he does, except confidential meetings and bathroom visits).
You know why?
Because when you document 
 on a daily basis, you are, at the very least, an 
voice. 
And that’s already more than many people are.
Social media personality Shaun “Shonduras” McBride has once defined entrepreneur as “someone who finds a way.” 
And you know the other side of that coin: a failed entrepreneur is someone who finds excuses.
The three most common excuses people use are the following:
• Fear of Failure
• Fear of Wasting Time
• Fear of Seeming Vain
Gary Vaynerchuk’s three pieces of advice to tackle these three fears are, in order:
• “There will always be people around you to tell you not to do things. You have to let yourself be your sole judge and jury.”
• “School and the nine-to-five grind are not going anywhere… People are so scared they’ll be wasting time if they try to build a business, even when their time isn’t valuable.”
• “Everyone’s an ass until they’re a pioneer.”
Anecdotes and success stories aside, this is almost certainly one of the shortest chapters you’ll ever find.
It consists of just one word which answers the implied question from its title:
.
II: Create Your Pillar
“No matter what kind of influencer you want to become,” writes Gary Vaynerchuk straightforwardly, “everyone must start with this step: create a Facebook business page.”
That’s the very first, non-negotiable step, the cost of entry to building a personal brand.
Once you open a Facebook page, you need to start creating and developing breakthrough opportunities for yourself in these two manners:
• Hashtags, “a strategy that requires an unbelievably long grind”;
• Direct-messaging, i.e., “reaching out directly to people and offering something of value in return for their attention, a strategy that requires an unbelievably long grind.”
As you can see, the keywords are “unbelievably long grind.”
In most cases, that means years—not months—before you get discovered.
“If that bothers you,” says, Vaynerchuk, “close the book.”
If that’s not the case, then on the following pages of it—basically, the second half of the book—you’ll be able to Vaynerchuk’s reviews and 101 intros to the major social platforms in existence.
Since the time the book was published, Musical.ly was bought by TikTok, and that’s the name under which it is famous now.
Famous, you say? How come I’ve never heard of it?
Well, that’s because you’re not aged between seven and seventeen.
If you were, then you would have been one of the hundreds of millions of pre-teens and teens who regularly use this platform to share very short videos.
In fact, 1 of 6 teenagers is most excited about musical.ly—not Twitter, not Facebook, not Instagram or Snapchat.
Best suited for entertainers, musical.ly is the way to go if you are a comedian, dancer, or a singer.
So, what are you waiting for: the time is ticking… tik-tok, tik-tok…
Gary is pretty big into Snapchat, and he believes that this is one of the most underestimated mediums available for building a personal brand.
After all, it only should be—with about 200 million active daily users!
But there’s one more reason Gary likes Snapchat so much: it is where you can be an authentic human being. 
Unlike the unreal photos shared on Instagram, Snapchat stories are unedited and unshareable—but that’s what makes them attractive.
True, it may be tricky for marketers to build a brand with no hashtags and with self-destructing content. 
But not making quick sales is a small price to pay for showing your rawest and unfiltered true self to your audience. 
Remember: authenticity always wins people.
And it is people who make sales.
Hands down, Gary has the best definition of Twitter we’ve ever read:
“Twitter is the water cooler of society, that place where everyone goes to get the latest update on whatever news or pop-culture event is occurring. The only difference is that, while office workers used to have to wait until the day after an event to gather around and share their knowledge and opinions, now that conversation is happening in real time, 24/7.”
Consequently, Twitter is all about two of the seven essentials: speed and attention.
So, catch the latest trends and stories and use the 
 to get ahead in the game.
As we’ve already mentioned in our summary of the first chapter, TV’s got nothing on YouTube, the video platform so big you should not even think about ignoring.
On the contrary: just start using it!
Of course, you may think that you’re not interesting and that you’ve got no video skills whatsoever, but, as we said above, that is beside the point.
YouTube is so big you’ll definitely find some kind of audience, no matter how specific your niche is.
Just think of it this way: there are videos with over half a million views which document nothing but garage sales! 
What’s so interesting about them? you ask.
Exactly.
So, start documenting your life and your passions. And upload your videos on YouTube. If nobody discovers them—then, you’ve got nothing to be ashamed about. If someone does—then you’ve got a potential subscriber.
As we said above, creating a Facebook page is the first thing you should do before starting any kind of business.
Ignore all those people who are saying that Facebook is 
anymore: people have been saying that for years, and the last time we checked, Facebook was still one of the most visited sites on the Internet.
And the best thing about it: there’s no better platform to target your audience than Facebook. This is true even if you have a small budget.
We’ve already summarized many Facebook-marketing-related books (such as 
 and 
), so—once again—what are you waiting for? 
Start doing something.
There’s no better way to connect with other influencers than Instagram. 
You know why?
Three reasons: 1) it’s the young people’s network; 2) it’s where the influencers are mostly; and 3) it’s where you can send them a private message.
Instagram may seem 
 polished, but we’ve never heard people complaining that there’s too much beauty or too much sun on those Instagram photos.
Plus: there’s no other platform where an egg is the most liked photo of all times, is there?
People nowadays are just too busy to read or watch films when they have time. Because, well, they never do: most of the time they’re doing something else.
And if that something else means riding the bus or the subway, then it feels like time lost.
Thus, the basis of the podcasts appeal.
Why reading this summary when you can listen to it from start to finish on the go?
If that feels like a rhetorical question, then you know what to do: start a podcast.
For introverted people, podcasts are better than YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram combined: you never have to show your face and, yet, build an audience of thousands or even tens of thousands.
If you are shy and afraid that the podcast market is crowded today, then there’s an even better way to communicate with your audience: voice-first content delivered through digital assistants such as Google’s Assistant or Amazon’s Alexa.
Gary says that voice-first is the future of interaction. And he’s usually right, isn’t he?

If You Want to Start a Business—These Are the Eight Things That Really Matter
According to Gary Vaynerchuk, entrepreneurs who fail to succeed don’t fail because they don’t care—they fail because they care for the wrong things.
And he says that there are no more than eight things worth caring about: the right intent, being authentic, being passionate about your job, being patient, being fast, hard work, being attentive to new trends and creating high quality and consistent content.
Conquer the Three Fears Which Prevent You from Becoming an Entrepreneur
Unfortunately, many young people give up on their dreams because of certain fears. Vaynerchuk believes that all of these fears belong to one of the following three categories: fear of failure, fear of wasting time, and fear of seeming vain.
The truth is: everybody who tries fails, but those who don’t try have already failed. An even bigger truth is that you’re 
wasting your time and that you’re not vain if you share knowledge with other people who want that knowledge shared.
So, stop thinking—and start doing things.
Create a Facebook Business Page—And Then Rummage Through the SM Platforms
The first step of becoming an entrepreneur is opening a Facebook page, the hub for your social media presence.
Then, you want to get discovered through the smart use of hashtags and direct messages.
All of the platforms available—TikTok, Snapchat, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, podcasts, and voice-first—can help you do this, so research them and use their advantages to make your mark.
Sometimes this process takes years, so be in it for the long run. 
And be prepared to endure it.

Final Notes
There’s a reason why Gary Vaynerchuk is considered a social media expert: he not only talks the talk but walks the walk as well.
A constant presence there, Vaynerchuk has made a name for himself as someone you 
follow, because he follows the right things and trends.
The same applies to his books and 
is no exception: there’s a reason why this book became an instant #1 New York Times bestseller, and why it has been endorsed by people such as John Mayer and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.
It’s because Vaynerchuk tactics work in practice as well."

Are you single or having marriage problems? Are you, in addition to that, a Christian?
Then you should allow Timothy Keller to explain to you:
.
Who Should Read “The Meaning of Marriage”? And Why?
, as Timothy Keller reveals in the “Introduction,” is a book for married and unmarried people, but also a book about the Bible. 
Since, as he says further on, “the foundation of it all is the Bible,” the book is primarily aimed for Christians, be they single, married, or divorce. In fact, it explicitly excludes members of the LGBT+ community by the very definition of marriage it proposes in the “Introduction.” So, read it if you think that marriage is (also) about God; don’t—if you think otherwise.

“The Meaning of Marriage PDF Summary”
Based “on a straightforward reading of Biblical texts,” 
 examines “the Christian understanding of marriage.” 
Meaning—whenever we mention the word “marriage” below, we’ll be talking about, in the words of the author, “a lifelong, monogamous relationship between a man and a woman.” 
Keller explains his definition further, thus:
The substance of 
draws on St. Paul’s thoughts on marriage expressed in Ephesians 5:18-33, and, in fact, each (but one) of its eight chapters begin with a quote taken from this passage, quoted in full as an epigraph to the book.
Everything else, as you’ll see in our summary, is basically a commentary on St. Paul.
One: The Secret of Marriage
The epigraph to Chapter 1, “The Secret of Marriage” is Ephesians 5:31-32: “A man shall leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. This is a profound mystery…”
Keller tries to explain away this mystery as the miracle of “two flawed people coming together to create a space of stability, love, and consolation—a haven in a heartless world.” It is a difficult task, and, unfortunately, it has been made even more difficult by modern understandings of marriage.
The evidence abounds: today, there are twice as many divorces as in 1960; only two-thirds of all births today are to married parents, and only 1 in 10 children was born to unmarried parents just half a century ago. Finally, and most tellingly, over 72% of American adults were married in 1960, but only 50% were in 2008.
The reason?
Well, the unfortunate movement from “we” to “me.” “Marriage used to be a public institution for the common good,” writes Keller, “and now it is a private arrangement for the satisfaction of the individuals. Marriage used to be about us, but now it is about me.”
Ironically, it is this newfound freedom in marriage (
) that has made spouses a little less free than before and much unhappier. 
Nowadays, you can marry everyone you want, and because of Disney and Hollywood, you expect to find “the perfectly compatible person.” It’s either that or nothing. The problem is “perfect” doesn’t exist, so many are left with nothing, “desperately trapped between both unrealistic longings for and terrible fears about marriage.”
Don’t believe Keller?
Here’s a curious stat: two-thirds of unhappy marriages should become happy within half a decade if people opt to stay married over getting divorced!
Two: The Power for Marriage
Chapter 2 is preceded by Ephesians 5:21: “Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.”
Here Keller presents Paul’s thesis that “all married partners need the work of the Holy Spirit in their lives.” 
Why?
Because it is only through the work of the Spirit that we can fight against the main enemy of marriage: self-centeredness!
And this is where Keller’s attack on the new notion of marriage—a union where two people can be as free as when single—really comes to the surface.
That, he says, is simply impossible!
When you decide on a career—be it a career in medicine, in law, or in the arts—the thing everybody asks you to do so that you can succeed is 
. You don’t become a writer without making a few sacrifices and dedicating your free time to writing, do you? And you don’t become a successful lawyer by simultaneously studying for a doctor’s degree, right? Well, why should marriage be any different?
“Whether we are husband or wife,” writes Keller, “we are not to live for ourselves but for the other.  And that is the hardest, yet single most important function of being a husband or a wife in marriage.”
Keller says that in a union—any kind of union—you have three possibilities (and three possibilities only): you can serve with joy, you can make an offer to serve with resentment or coldness, or you can selfishly insist on your own way.
Only one of these choices leads to happiness and fulfillment in marriage, and we don’t need to tell you which one.
Three: The Essence of Marriage
In the third chapter of 
(which opens with Ephesians 5:31), Keller gets the reader “into the heart of what marriage is all about—namely, 
.”
Of course, the question he tries to give an answer to here is one of the oldest ones in the book: what, in God’s name, is love actually? 
Contrary to what you think, love is not just another name for the butterflies in your stomach when you meet the one you think is 
 one.
“When you first fall in love,” reminds us Keller, “you think you love the person, but you don’t really. You can’t know who the person is right away. That takes years. You actually love your 
 of the person—and that is always, at first, one-dimensional and somewhat mistaken.”
The real love comes after this, when you actually get to meet the person you’ve fallen in love with. In fact, argues Keller, love is almost never what happens in the present: it is what gives validity to the promises for the future.
He writes:
True love is not just horizontal—it is vertical as well. When a covenant is made before God, God is also a part of the marriage. And when He is there, every broken promise is paid doubly.
Four: The Mission of Marriage
Now, you might ask, why would one need a “horizontal” relationship to somebody from the opposite sex if he can connect on a “vertical” level, and bask joyfully in the eternal love of God?
First of all, think of it (of course, only metaphorically if you’re religious) as a sort of a design flaw: Adam lived in the Garden of Eden and had the privilege of conversing with God Himself, and yet, he felt alone, and needed an Eve to be complete.
Ever since, every one of us feels pretty much the same. To paraphrase Black, “we need a friend, oh, we need a friend—to make us happy, not stand here on our own…” Our spouse should, in (Christian) theory, be our best friend.
And that means much more than you think. Namely, it doesn’t merely mean having someone around you to understand you, but also having someone able to “see your flaws, imperfections, weaknesses, dependencies” and yet see beneath them the person you can become, “the person God wants you to be.”
Once again, love is not about the present you: it is about the future us. And that’s the mission of marriage: transforming you into someone you can be, someone you would have never become in the absence of the Other.
Five: Loving the Stranger
Chapter five carries on with this discussion, exploring further the relationship between the present and the future in marriage, between knowledge and love.
And it starts with a telling quote from American theologian Stanley Hauerwas who argued in “Sex and Politics: Bertrand Russell and ‘Human Sexuality’” that the primary problem in marriage is “learning how to love and care for the stranger to whom you find yourself married.”
No matter how long you’ve dated somebody before, marrying him/her means marrying a stranger—because marriage brings out many traits in both you and your partner that, up to that moment, were hidden from everybody.
And now the real fight begins!
And, interestingly enough, it is a twofold fight: you’re not only confronted with the real person that is your spouse, but also with the real person that you yourself are.
But, that’s why you have each other: to see in one another the “better person” that each of you can become and to help each other on the way.
That’s why, writes Keller, “one of the most basic skills in marriage is the ability to tell the straight, unvarnished truth about what your spouse has done—and then, completely, unself-righteously, and joyously express forgiveness without a shred of superiority, without making the other person feel small.”
Six: Embracing the Other
Chapter 6 is written entirely by Timothy’s wife, Kathy Keller; understandably, since it addresses one of the most controversial issues in Christian marriage, formulated by St. Paul in Ephesians 5:22-3, thus: “Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.”
Kathy combines these verses with Ephesians 5:25 (“Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her”) to speak about a pretty controversial topic nowadays: gender differences.
Unsurprisingly, she says that there are quite a few, and that these naturally result in two different functions: that of the husband, and that of the wife. It was always God’s plan to make males and females different. And it was always a part of our duties to live in tune with our designs.
As far as women are concerned, this means voluntary submission, i.e., “a gift offered… not a duty coerced.” Marriage is all about embracing Otherness, which is why homosexual marriages inhibit growth, as opposed to heterosexual ones.
“A person of one’s own sex is not as likely to have as much Otherness to embrace,” writes Kathy, “But God’s plan for married couples involves embracing the otherness to make us unified, and that can only happen between a man and a woman.”
Seven: Singleness and Marriage
OK, if the above is true as far as homosexuals are concerned, what does that say about single people? They have even less Otherness to embrace. And if the mission of marriage is to make one 
than he/she already is, does that mean that single people are, by default, not as fulfilled as married people?
To tell you the truth, we don’t think the Kellers address this question properly. 
They say that, nowadays, when so many people put so much burden on marriage, and have so many expectations from it, singleness results in depression and despair. They 
feel unfulfilled and unsatisfied, and even envious of other people’s happiness.
If you are a Christian, however, that doesn’t happen, since you already have “a deeply fulfilling love relationship with Christ now, and hope in a perfect love relationship with him in the future.” This may inspire you to find a spouse, but it can also help you live a fairly fulfilled life without one.
Of course, if that is so, then marriage has little meaning; and if it is not, then you cannot live on Christ’s love alone (see the summary of chapter 4 for more).
Eight: Sex and Marriage
“For this reason,” says St. Paul in Ephesians 5:31, “a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” 
This act of “becoming one flesh,” however, has rarely been considered as something holy. In fact, quite the contrary: sex was a “dirty deed” in the eyes of many Christian theologians and thinkers, which is why it was also seen as unholy by many governments throughout history.
Keller says that this is not supported by the Bible and that “Biblical Christianity may be the most body-positive religion in the world.”
Even more, he says, that “sex is perhaps the most powerful God-created way to help you give your entire self to another human being.  Sex is God’s appointed way for two people to reciprocally say to one another, ‘I belong completely, permanently, and exclusively to you.’
“You must not use sex to say anything less,” concludes Keller and makes his case for sex in marriage being the only acceptable form of sex:
Sex, for Keller, is both a uniting act and a covenant renewal service; and it is just as important as love. In fact, it should be understood in much the same manner: it is not something you 
, but something you 
.
To one and one person only.
Key Lessons from “The Meaning of Marriage”
1.      You Will Never Find a Perfect Partner
2.      Knowledge Without Love Is Dreadful; Love Without Knowledge Is Superficial
3.      Marriage Is About Serving the Other (and Serving God)
You Will Never Find a Perfect Partner
No matter how much you try, you’ll never find such a thing as a “soul mate,” i.e., “a perfectly compatible match.” 
Forget Disney and Hollywood: “happily married ever after” is a thing of fancy.
Marriage is much harder than you think; but, also, much more rewarding.
Knowledge Without Love Is Dreadful; Love Without Knowledge Is Superficial
So, finding someone perfectly compatible was never the point of marriage. 
Because, in that case, growth is inhibited. And marriage is all about growth, all about finding someone who’ll love you 
 for the way you are at the moment, but for what you can become in the future.
In fact, marriage is, almost always, a union between two strangers. We fall in love with the idea of a person, and that is not love—it’s just a superficial, physiologically explainable feeling. Only after really understanding someone you know your true feelings for him/her.
That’s why, when you love somebody even after finding out most of his/her traits, you can be absolutely sure that you actually love him/her.
Marriage Is About Serving the Other 
Marriage, writes Keller, “is a way for two spiritual friends to help each other on their journey to become the persons God designed them to be.”
In other words, marriage means becoming 
than you are with the help of someone else. To allow this process, you need to surrender yourself to that someone else.
And by surrendering, we do mean “surrendering”: marriage is not the place to look for freedom. Quite the opposite, it is the place where you find the 
 boundaries.
Just like religion.
Which is why a Christian marriage (if we believe the Kellers) beats non-Christian marriages: once you learn to be submissive to Christ, it’s easier to learn to surrender to a fellow human being.

“The Meaning of Marriage Quotes”
Our Critical Review
Unlike many too one-sided Christian books on the subject, 
 has a lot to offer and is quite rich with both insights and wisdom that should certainly help its readers, be they single or married.
However, we found it difficult to take much of it seriously since it’s often self-contradicting, and it almost never takes into consideration what should marriage mean for those that are 
 Christians.
So, if you are a Christian, this book justifies the title and will teach you a lot, not only about the meaning of marriage but also about the meaning of life. However, if you are not, you’ll probably find almost nothing of value on most of its pages."

Who Should Read “The Barefoot Investor”? And Why?
“Money may not make you happy, but the research shows that not being in control of your finances will make you very unhappy.”
Thus says Scott Pape, but we don’t need him or scientific studies to be reminded of this dreadfully accurate axiom. 
However, we 
 need at least one of them to get the upper hand and start being in control of our finances.
is a great way to do this. Recommended for anyone struggling to live a financially comfortable life.
The Barefoot Investor Summary
“Without my knowledge or approval,” writes Scott Pape in the “Prelude” to 
, “the Department of Environment and Primary Industries had rolled up at first light and begun destroying my surviving sheep. Apparently, they can do that when your farm is declared part of a disaster zone.”
“Two chimneys and a pile of rubble were the sum total of a lifetime of possessions,” he adds, after witnessing with his wife Liz the destruction. “Her wedding dress. Tea cups. The few last remaining photos of her late father, who had died 10 years earlier. Butter knives. All of my baby son’s clothes. All of his toys. Everything was gone.”
And when everything was falling apart, three words came to the mind of Pape: “I’ve got this.” That’s when the idea for this book was born.
It’s also the moment when another idea came to Pape’s mind: to plant an apple tree.
Because that’s where everything starts.
And it’s a process afterward.
“After all,” Scott writes, “you don’t plant an apple tree on a Saturday and then come back on Sunday and stand with your hands on your hips and scowl: ‘Where are my freaking apples?’”
What you do instead is quite simple: you just plant the tree and wait. 30 years later, your sapling will transform into a” big, beautiful tree with thick, strong branches that you attach a rope to as a swing for your grandkids to play on. And the apples feed your entire family.”
Why?
Because that’s how nature works: plant → grow → harvest.
Well, that’s how money works as well. And 
is here to take you through the whole process.
Bonus: 
.
But – to our job.
Part 1: Plant
“It’s time to get your hands dirty” – that’s how Pape introduces his journey to wealth. And then he demonstrates, in three steps, how you can 
the seeds of your future wealth.
Most people overestimate what they can achieve in one year money-wise, but underestimate what they can achieve in half a dozen years.
So that you do not become one of them, a good place to start is, well, with a date.
May it be your partner, your friend, your special friend, or even yourself – but the monthly Barefoot date night is a prerogative.
For three reasons:
. 
True, it may seem like such a silly idea, but Scott Pape promises you that, in time, you’ll grow to like them so much that you’ll look forward to them.
If you want to make a good family financial plan, then you need your partner on board. You’ve got to work together and the Barefoot date nights make that possible. If you’re single – don’t worry: then you don’t have to play the partner mind games: you only need to look after yourself.
True, there are many people and books which say the opposite, but, even truer, only a naïve person would ever believe this. It is a process, and you need to 
 it.
Use these barefoot date nights to look at things such as bank fees and superfunds: if you are not paying zero fees and you don’t have a superfund, then you’re doing something wrong.
But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
We already told you, in our summary of 
that self-discipline and willpower don’t work; what works is automation.
Well, this step introduces you to Pape’s “Serviette Strategy,” his “simple, three-‘bucket’ solution where you put your money on autopilot, so you’ll never have to worry about it again.”
How does it work?
Just allocate your income each month in three buckets:
• 
, “for daily expenses, the occasional splurge and some extra cash to fight financial fires;”
• 
, “to provide some ‘safety money” (online savings account with another institution; reserve $2,000 in here on your first Barefoot date night); and
• 
, “to build long-term wealth and total security” (9.5% of your wage reserved in an ultra-low-fee superfund).
Allocate further by using this simple strategy to distribute the money in your Blow Bucket:
• 
 (10%)
• 
 (10%)
• 
 (20%)
As for the rest 60%?
Well, they are (understandably) reserved for daily expenses and define 
, the money necessary for you to run “You, Inc.”:
• housing (rent or home loan*): 30 percent
• utilities (power, gas, water, broadband, phones): 5–10 percent
• transport: 5–10 percent
• insurance: 5 percent
• food: 5–10 percent.
Now, you don’t need Pape to tell you that we’re living in 
: half of the things we own we don’t actually own and could lose every single moment.
You don’t need that stress in your life, so it’s time to do away with it.
Time to domino your debts!
And to do that, there are only five dominos you need to set up right:
This, of course, is the first thing to do when dealing with your debts: calculate it in its entirety. 
Whether we’re talking about parking fines or credit cards, car loans or money owed to friends – write all of it down. 
You need nothing more but a four-column table: name of debt, total amount, interest rate, monthly minimum.
“There’s something very powerful about getting stuff out of your head and down on paper,” notes Pape. 
.
A bank costs more money to get a new customer than it does to keep an existing one. In other words, banks will do everything they can to 
 let you go.
Use this to renegotiate your credit card rates, threatening to leave the bank in case your demands are not met; of course, it’s crucial that you don’t sound like a terrorist. Nobody likes that kind of customer.
“It’s time for some plastic surgery,” writes Pape. “Cut up all your credit cards. Take a photo, and post it on the Barefoot Investor Facebook page. Get ready for an avalanche of ‘likes.’” It helps to know that someone has your back.
Now it’s time to detonate your debts. To do so, rearrange the list you made in Step 1 – from smallest to largest. 
And use your Fire Extinguisher – remember: 20% of your take-home pay and you Blow Bucket – to ‘hose down’ your smallest debt.
Then turn the hose to the next debt, and the next, until they’re all put out.
Once again, it may sound silly, but it is not – after each paid debt, organize a small (or large, depending on the debt) bill-burning ceremony.
“Celebrating is really, really important,” writes Pape. “You need to give yourself a pat on the back for having a small win. That’s how you build momentum. You’re training your brain to win.”
Part 2: Grow
Now that you’ve planted your wealth tree and domino-ed your debts, it’s time to grow your fortune. Learn how to earn more and save more in three simple steps:
First of all, you need to realize that rent money is not dead money – well, “at least not in the short term while you get your life and finances in order.”
In other words, in case you want to become a wealthy person, it is very important to buy a home and don’t rent; however, it is even more important to not rush into anything.
Most people, warns Pape, make these five mistakes when buying a home:
#1. They’re waiting for a crash
#2. hey buy a home they can’t afford
#3. They buy an investment property first
#4. They rent but forget to save
#5. They don’t consider other options
If you haven’t made any of these five mistakes so far, then you’re on a good path: you just need to learn how to save for home deposit properly.
According to Pape, you need 20% of your paycheck to do that.
That’s right – you’ve guessed it: the Fire Extinguisher Bucket.
It served you well so far to domino your debts, but now that you don’t have any, it will serve you even better to buy you a home.
You can even go overboard: learn how to live off of one salary (it is possible, and it’s short-term), and save your partner’s entire salary for your home for two years. 
It’s just enough to end up with a home.
In Step 2 we told you that 9.5% of your paycheck goes into a grow fund; usually – and in many countries – this is paid by your employer; that’s how one gets his pension in most of the world.
Now, there’s a trick to get an even better deal: after you’re done buying a home, boost this to 15% (i.e., add 5.5% yourself)!
If you’ve already read our summary of 
, you already know this part – that’s where Pape borrows it from.
But here’s it again:
If you’re 30 and you’re earning about $72,000 a year, 5.5% of your yearly salary amounts to a little more than 330$ a month or just $10 a day.
What does saving $10 a day would mean to you 37 years later when you’ll retire at the age of 67?
Well, assuming conservatively just 8% growth, and 2% inflation, you’ll be richer for more than half a million dollars!
Add to that the amount saved by your employer and, yup, you’ll retire a 
millionaire ($2,063,179 to be more exact)!
If you follow Scott Pape’s first five steps pretty carefully, by Step 6, you’ll be able to basically forget everything around you and start living your life to the fullest!
But there’s one more thing you should do before starting to feel the happiest you can ever be: triple the amount in your Mojo Bucket.
What does this mean?
It doesn’t mean just putting $6,000 on the side; it means having – at all times – three Blow Buckets in your Mojo Bucket; so, if you’re earning $5,000 a month, put $15,000 in your Mojo Bucket after domino-ing your debts, buying a house and increasing your super to 15%.
Why?
Because that’s what security is; that’s what freedom is; and, according to many studies: that’s what happiness is.
Part 3: Harvest
“Ask any farmer what their favorite time of the year is, and they’ll tell you ‘harvest!’” We don’t need to tell you why; but Pape wants to show you 
to harvest even more.
“If your home loan is with a big bank,” notes Pape, “there’s a good chance you’re getting screwed. Generally speaking, the banks don’t do the best deals on home loans because… they don’t need to.”
But believe it or not, you can wipe off almost 7 years of your mortgage and save over $77,641 by adhering to these three simple rules:
Let Scott Pape remind you of something: “A home loan is a pretty simple proposition: you borrow money from the bank to buy a home and then pay it back with interest over 25 to 30 years.” Everything else – repayment holidays, fixing a portion of your loan, etc. – is where the bank makes its margin.
You know why banks are offering fixed-rate deals? Because exit fees are banned and want to stop you from switching to a better deal. Fixed-rate loans give them that power.
As we said above, it’s more expensive for banks to find a new customer; six times more expensive to be exact; use this knowledge to get a cheaper rate.
How does this work?
Simple: threaten your bank that you’ll refinance if your bank doesn’t drop its rate; stay firm in your demands, and you’ll probably save $22k on your loan based on a mortgage of $400k over 18 years at 4%.
What if your bank doesn’t agree to your demands?
Well, ring them again.
And if they don’t agree then as well – switch.
And start the procedure once again.
Some will say that you need $1 million saved in order to retire and live happily as long as you do with your partners; others add “$1 million each,” i.e., $2 million in full.
What does Scott Pape say?
Though the more money, the better: $170k in super for singles or $250k for couples is just enough by the time you retire.
If you’ve paid off your debts and your home and you’re getting a pension, then you’ll end up with more than $60,000 yearly from the age of 67 onward.
You don’t need more.
How do you like to be remembered?
As the guy who drove a C-Class Mercedes or the one who gave away some of his/her money to charity or scientific organizations and helped the lives of those around you get better?
It’s not even a question, is it?
After all, nobody ever gets remembered for driving a Mercedes.
If you manage to build wealth, share some of it– with those you love and those who need it more than you.
That way, you’ll be remembered.
The right way.
Key Lessons from “The Barefoot Investor”
1.      Schedule a Monthly Barefoot Date Night with Your Partner 
2.      Allocate Your Monthly Payments in Three Buckets
3.      Live Off 60 Percent of Your Income (Aka: The Barefoot Benchmark) 
Schedule a Monthly Barefoot Date Night with Your Partner 
The first step of retiring wealthy and living a comfortable life (at least money-wise) is only remotely related to money; and it’s the most pleasurable one.
Namely, setting up a monthly financial date night with your partner; treat yourself, say, the last Friday of every month and use that day to talk finance.
Use the first few dates to set up a long-term strategy and rules: it’s the two of you against the world, and, more than anything, you want your partner on board when it comes to financial fears and solutions.
Allocate Your Monthly Payments in Three Buckets
The foundation of Scott Pape’s plan: allocating your monthly income in three buckets:
• 
, “for daily expenses, the occasional splurge and some extra cash to fight financial fires;”
• 
, “to provide some ‘safety money” (online savings account with another institution; reserve $2,000 in here on your first Barefoot date night); and
• 
, “to build long-term wealth and total security” (9.5% of your wage reserved in an ultra-low-fee superfund).
Live Off 60 Percent of Your Income (Aka: The Barefoot Benchmark)
Now, the Blow Bucket is mostly for daily expenses, but the daily expenses should never amount to more than 60% of your income.
In Scott Pape’s experience, this should prove to be more than enough for you to deal with housing, utilities, transport, insurance and food.
The rest 40% should be divided into three smaller buckets: the Splurge Bucket (10% for short-term pleasures), the Smile Bucket (10% for long-term pleasures), and the Fire Extinguisher (20% for debts and when they are done, home deposits).

Who Should Read “Smarter”? And Why?
is a book which everyone who believes that IQ cannot be improved should read; if you don’t believe the studies which say otherwise, you’ll have to believe Hurley, because he didn’t stop at merely reading the articles: he tested them out personally.
His findings will certainly interest psychology students and all those people out there who constantly try to hack their brains – and on a daily basis. 
Well, time to see what science says about your experiments.
Smarter Summary
Retaking the Mensa Test
Have you ever taken an IQ test with Mensa, “the high IQ society”?
If so, you probably already know two things:
1) You’re in if you score higher than 132;
2) You can’t retake your test.
OK – you understand the first one; but why the second one? Your teachers begged you to take another math or physics test in case you failed the first one! Why is Mensa doing the opposite?
“Mensa does not permit applicants to take its IQ test twice,” says Dan Hurley, “because the organization ascribes to the view that intelligence doesn’t change much, so there’s really no point in retaking it. Either you got it or you don’t.”
Another question:
Doesn’t this imply that your intelligence is kind of inscribed in your genes and there’s nothing you can do to change it?
Well, until as recently as 2008, “the consensus among mainstream intelligence researchers was that human intelligence is just too complex, and too closely linked to innate characteristics of the brain, to be significantly modified by any straightforward training method.”
Because “unlike a test of physical strength, which measures only how you performed today, intelligence tests have always been pitched as an upper limit on what you can ever do: a cognitive glass ceiling, a number tattooed on the soul.”
And then, in May 2008, two Swiss researchers, Susanne Jaeggi and Martin Buschkuehl, published a study in the prominent 
 reporting on what happened when college students played a peculiar computerized game called the N-back for twenty minutes a day, five days a week, for four weeks.
The title of the study already says a lot:
“
.”
But to understand its implications, you’ll have to bear with us for 12 minutes.
Intelligence Matters
First of all, something you should never forget – especially 
 in our just too-PC times: intelligence matters.
Sure,
, and Angela Duckworth can add that 
 is really what separates the best from the rest, but IQ is (and always will be) a factor of utmost importance.
“Certainly IQ is not everything,” writes Hurley, “perhaps it’s not even the most important thing, but it’s definitely one of them. As we all knew in elementary school and can see in our workplaces and on the front pages of the newspaper every day, intelligence, or smarts, or whatever you want to call it, does matter.”
After all, we are defined by it: the very existence of 
is a proof that intelligence differentiates species; a
, this means that some humans are most probably different from other humans due to slightly higher intelligence.
Just think of it this way: based on their high scores on standardized tests, both Sergey Brin and Mark Zuckerberg – Lady Gaga as well – were selected to attend the Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins.
And it goes beyond identifying smart people at a very early age!
For example, a recent study of 1,116,442 Swedish men whose IQs were tested at age eighteen found that after twenty-two years (i.e., at the age of 40), those who scored in the bottom 25% were over 5 times more likely to have died of poisoning, 3 times more likely to have drowned, and over twice as likely to have been killed in a traffic accident as those who scored in the top 25 percent!
And a host of other studies confirm this.
The Highly Unamerican Idea of Eugenics
Now, we, as Americans, do not want to be told these kinds of things, right?
After all, this country made its name by adhering strictly to the ultrademocratic motto: everyone can be whatever one chooses to be.
The very idea of your IQ being inscribed in your genes goes so much against this dictum that one would not be blamed for reasoning that it’s preposterous to even think something like “intelligence is heritable” and/or “intelligence cannot be changed” this side of the Atlantic.
And yet, it was in the United States that the pseudoscience of eugenics had its birthplace!
Championed by the likes of Margaret Sanger, J. H. Kellogg, and Alexander Graham Bell, the idea that the unintelligent will forever remain to be that way resulted in over 60,000 forced sterilizations in the US, going all the way into the 1960s!
In fact, for a time, it was even sanctioned by the U.S. Supreme Court and funded by some of the most philanthropic organizations of all times: the Carnegie Institution and the 
.
Want to hear the worst part?
The eugenics movement in the US “was credited by Nazi leaders, including Adolf Hitler himself, as inspiring their ‘war on the weak.’”
If you think that’s a thing of the past, think again: your President, just like 
, base their worldviews upon this kind of reasoning, still believing, for example, that illegal Hispanic immigrants to America have lower IQs than non-Hispanic whites.
Fluid and Crystallized Intelligence
Now, back to our May 2008 study.
You got the gist of that title: intelligence 
 be improved. 
However, you may have had some problems understanding the meaning of that word “fluid” before the word “intelligence.”
Unsurprisingly, that’s the keyword.
You see, back in 1971, the British-American psychologist Raymond Cattell first theorized the existence of two different types of general intelligence: fluid and crystallized intelligence.
Crystallized intelligence is your “treasure trove of stored-up information and how-to knowledge, which just keeps growing as you age – the sort of thing tested on 
 or put to use when you ride a bicycle.”
Fluid intelligence, on the other hand, is “the underlying ability to learn, the capacity to solve novel problems, see underlying patterns, and figure out things that were never explicitly taught.”
And unlike crystallized intelligence, fluid intelligence peaks in early adulthood and then gradually declines.
This is the reason why most mathematicians, physicists, musicians and chess players are best in their 20s and 30s; afterward, they are unable to solve novel problems, so the quality of their work declines.
Another problem with fluid intelligence: based on everything we knew for half a century (and even the whole century before that), it was “impervious to the effects of training.”
We now know better.
Measuring Fluid Intelligence
No matter what most people say nowadays, standard IQ tests are not a bad indicator of someone’s intelligence; after all, we do know that if you score below a certain number on those tests, then you’ll probably receive Social Security income.
However, we 
 know – at least now – that standard IQ tests are not perfect; and that no matter how good they are, they can’t be, by definition, objective.
However, though intuitively quite graspable, intelligence – just like some other important things (love, truth, time) – is scientifically wholly inscrutable.
Where is it located? How does it work? How is it related to memory?
The bad news: we’re still far from finding the exact answers to these questions; the good news: we’re getting there.
How?
By scanning the brain, of course.
Even though numerous studies had discovered that the size of the brain does matter when it came to intelligence even before the last decade, none of them had shown the actual extent.
That is, until recently.
Now, fMRI scans have discovered an almost exact number: about 6.7% of a person’s fluid intelligence can be explained by the overall volume of neurons in his/her “gray matter.” In other words, the bigger your brain, the smarter you are.
And it goes beyond the gray matter: an addition 5% of the fluid intelligence can be explained by the size of a particular region of the brain – the left lateral prefrontal cortex.
In case you don’t know what that is, it is a section located behind the upper-left edge of your hairline.
Well, fMRI scans have shown that this part of your brain becomes highly active during tests of working memory.
Now, if your working memory is connected to a part of your brain which is connected, in turn, to your fluid intelligence – that’s right!
The N-Back Game
Let us remind you of the title of that field-defining study we mentioned in our first section: “Improving Fluid Intelligence with Training on Working Memory.”
Now it doesn’t seem that incomprehensible, does it?
Well, time to explain how Susanne Jaeggi and Martin Buschkuehl proved this.
As we mentioned above, they did so, using a peculiar game called N-back. After four weeks of tests, students who played the game for 20 minutes a day 5 days a week increased their intelligence by almost 40%!
If you don’t believe the hype, ask the author of this book himself: for the purposes of his book, he went through the same kind of training (coupled with some things explained below), and, by the end of it, his intelligence scores climbed 16.4 percent.
In other words, his fluid intelligence 
 improved.
What’s this game we’re talking about, you ask?
Well, nothing particularly fancy.
The N-back game consists of guessing how far back a particular letter appeared in a sequence. In other words, if you’re playing the 1-back game, you’re asked to press a keyboard key when you notice that a letter has just appeared.
For example, in the sequence “A B C B 
 A,” the only time you’ll have to press a keyboard key after the fourth (here bolded) letter. 
In the 2-back game, the same rules apply, only in this case, you’ll have to remember up to two places back, i.e., in the sequence above, you’ll have to press the keyboard key after the third letter (“A B C 
 B A”).
There’s also a dual N-back game (where you follow both audio and visual signals), and you can 
.
Do play it – because it makes you 
 smarter.
Other Ways to Increase Your Intelligence
Playing computer games (
) is not the only way to increase your fluid intelligence.
And we know this at least since the 1960s when one study demonstrated that older people who regularly play tennis are consistently better at cognitive tests than those who didn’t.
With this in mind, Teresa Liu-Ambrose – “a spritely forty-year-old jogger, dog lover, and mother of three who holds an impressive list of academic credentials” – randomly divided 86 women into three groups.
Each of these was supposed to train something for six months: one group toning, the other aerobic and the last one resistance.
At the end of the study, this last group showed significant improvements in traditional cognitive tests; even better: fMRI scans discovered increased activity in the areas connected to fluid intelligence.
Resistance training, it is then!
Add to that something more enjoyable: music lessons.
Glenn Schellenberg, a psychologist who doesn’t really believe in the Mozart effect, has shown that whether it is voice lessons, keyboard lessons or acting lessons – they all improve fluid intelligence.
Voice lessons in particular; keyboard lessons follow; and even acting lessons are better than no lessons at all.
In other words, your brain is an organ and is worse off when not used; if used correctly, it can improve your chances at success in life.
Demonstrated by many studies of the last decade.
Tested by Dan Hurley.
And – get this! – approved by the US military which, in 2006, founded the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) whose mission is explicitly stated thus: “to envision and lead high-risk, high-payoff research that delivers innovative technology for future overwhelming intelligence advantage.”
Still skeptical?
Key Lessons from “Smarter”
1.      There Are Two Types of Intelligence – and Only One of Them Gets Better with Age
2.      There’s a Good Chance That Some Computer Games Might Make You Smarter
3.      Never Mind the Scores: Intelligence Is Tested by Life
There Are Two Types of Intelligence – and Only One of Them Gets Better with Age
The reason why Mensa doesn’t allow people to retake their tests is simple: they believe that intelligence doesn’t change much throughout life.
The truth is – a part of it most certainly does. 
It is called crystallized intelligence, and it is the “treasure trove of stored-up information and how-to knowledge” in your brain. As expected, on average, older people know more than young ones – and this is due to their crystallized intelligence.
However, young people are far more creative and capable of solving novel problems. This is due to another part of the general intelligence, called fluid intelligence. 
Now, unfortunately, fluid intelligence declines with age; and this is that part of your intelligence that Mensa believes is unchangeable.
New studies, however, show that it is.
There’s a Good Chance That Some Computer Games Make You Smarter
According to a field-defining 2008 study by two Swiss scientists, the so-called N-back game (which you can play for free online) improves one’s fluid intelligence.
And this is true even if merely played for 20 minutes, 5 days a week, over a 4-week period.
What are you waiting for?
Here’s one game you can convince your parents that is 
 for your sake.
Never Mind the Scores: Intelligence Is Tested by Life
Computer games are not the only thing proven to improve intelligence; resistance training and music lessons have pretty much the same effect as well.
Using a combination of science-backed exercises for intelligence improvement, the author of 
Dan Hurley, did indeed become smarter by 16.4%.
“And so what?” – he writes in the last chapter of his book. “Those are just numbers on a test. In the end, for all of us, the best test of cognitive abilities is one for which there is no answer key. It’s called life.”
And he offers a great example of what he means by this:
“From 1986 to 1989, Marilyn Vos Savant was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as having the highest recorded IQ in the world for women, at 190. Since then, what has she done? She has been writing 
 magazine’s ‘Ask Marilyn’ advice column. I mean –

Who Should Read “The Blue Zones”? And Why?
Some people live longer than others; Dan Buettner has spent more than a decade of his life finding why by exploring the regions with most centenarians personally, by interviewing these centenarians more than once, over a long period of time.
The result is 
, a book you must read if you want to live a longer life, and, even more importantly, a life worthy enough to be lengthened.
The Blue Zones Summary
The Book at a Glance
In November 2005, Dan Buettner – then an internationally recognized researcher and explorer, now a 
 best-selling author as well – wrote a cover story for 
titled “The Secrets of a Long Life.”
In it, for the first time in history, he used the phrase “blue zones” to refer to regions of the world where people live longer than average.
Three years later, the article evolved in a book – 
 – which in 2012 was revised and updated for a second edition, this one more specifically subtitled: 
A few other related books and articles have appeared in the meantime, culminating in the Blue Zones Project, Dan Buettner’s attempt to apply his Blue Zones principles to actual communities and towns around the world (mostly in the US).
These principles are listed in the seventh (originally sixth) and last chapter of 
,
Dan Buettner’s most celebrated and popular book.
Buettner describes this chapter (titled “Your Personal Blue Zone”) as “a cross-cultural distillation of the world’s best practices in longevity”, “a de facto formula for longevity—the best, most credible information available for adding years to your life and life to your years.”
And since the other five chapters are on-field reports of the original five Blue Zones which cover pretty much the same things but with emphasis on the places and people rather than on the action advices, we felt that the best and most useful way to summarize this book is to run through its sixth chapter, i.e., to share with you Dan Buettner’s nine lessons for living longer.
But, before that – let’s just take a quick look at the places.
The Original Blue Zones
A Blue Zone, as we said above, is a place where people live longer than average. 
The first edition of Dan Buettner’s 
discussed four such regions, and the second one added a fifth.
These are the places, “the world’s confirmed longevity hotspots,” the original Blue Zones themselves:
, particularly the Barbagia region;
 The islands of 
;
 The Seventh-day Adventist community of 
;
 
; and
The island of 
 (not included in the first edition).
After an introductory chapter, each of the following five chapters delves deep in these cultures, trying to extract the secrets of longevity; and everywhere Buettner encounters a different culture that has taken its own unique path to long life. 
He also shows how “history, genes, and time-honored traditions conspire to favor each population;” and he tries to find scientific explanations why these people live longer (and better) than most of us.
The Nine Lessons for Living Longer
“If you live the average American lifestyle,” writes Dan Buettner at the beginning of the most important chapter of 
 
,
“you may never reach your potential maximum lifespan. You might even fall short by as much as a decade.”
And then he asks a rhetorical question: “But what if you could follow a simple program that could help you feel younger, lose weight, maximize your mental sharpness, and keep your body working as long as possible? Indeed, what if you could get back that extra decade of healthy life that you may unknowingly be squandering?”
Of course, Buettner doesn’t stop there, and he goes on to present the “Power Nine,” “the world’s best practices in health and longevity,” all distilled from his experiences with the centenarians of the Blue Zones.
The best part: they are all not merely described, but also paired with relevant strategies to apply them in your life.
Or: 
“Longevity all-stars don’t run marathons or compete in triathlons,” writes Dan Buettner. “Instead, they engage in regular, low-intensity physical activity, often as part of a daily work routine.”
In Sardinia, most of the people spend their lives working as shepherds, a profession which involves miles of hiking on a daily basis; in Okinawa, the centenarians garden for hours every single day; and the Adventists in USA’s only Blue Zone take nature walks.
Now, it’s your turn to follow them thus:
: get rid of your remote control and use the bicycle as often as possible;
. Don’t force yourself to go to the gym, but do take a walking break instead of a coffee break at work;
. Find a friend whose company you enjoy and arrange the first of thousands of walking dates.
. Be an Okinawan.
. Don’t say we haven’t told you this before!
Or: 
“Hara Hachi Bu” is a Confucian-inspired adage which all Okinawans say before eating. It means “Eat until you are 80 percent full.”
There’s a reason for that: as the Okinawans know, it takes some time before the stomach tells the brain how full it is, so eating 80 percent is just enough. 
That is why the average daily intake of Okinawans is only about 1,900 calories.
Try it yourself:
, aka stop eating when you’re 80% full;
Drink two smoothies, and you’ll probably eat less for lunch later while feeling even fuller.
The smaller the vessels, the less you’ll eat (science says so).
 
 Avoid tempting foods. Put candy bowls, cookie jars, and other temptations out of sight.
Put the scale in your way.
Eating faster results in eating more.
Don’t watch TV while eating.
Also, don’t eat on the run: eat purposefully.
Interestingly enough,
in the Blue Zones, “the biggest meal of the day is typically eaten during the first half of the day. Nicoyans, Okinawans, and Sardinians eat their biggest meal at midday, while Adventists consume many of their calories for breakfast.”
Or: 
In Genesis 1:29, God says to Adam and Eve: “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; it shall be food for you.”
Unsurprisingly, the Adventists of Loma Linda, California, take this seriously and avoid meat altogether. Most centenarians of Sardinia, Okinawa and Nicoya have done that as well for most of their lives, primarily because they often didn’t have any access to meat to start with.
Durum wheat (Sardinia), sweet potato (Okinawa), and maize (Nicoya) did the trick for them.
It can work for you as well:
No portion of meat larger than a deck of cards – and only twice a week.
Hide the M&Ms but showcase the fruit.
. “Beans are a cornerstone of each of the Blue Zone diets,” writes Buettner. “Make beans – or tofu – the centerpiece of lunches and dinners.”
.
. So as to switch from snacks to nuts, the best way is to always have some nuts around.
Or: 
Emphasis on the parenthesis above: consistency and moderation (
 already) are key. A glass of red wine or sake with friends or with each meal – no more than one a day – is more than “not bad;” it’s actually 
for both your health and longevity.
 For example, the Sardinians drink Cannonau in their Blue Zone. 
 “Set up yours to include a glass of wine, nuts as an appetizer, and a gathering of friends or time with a spouse.”
 A serving or two per day is the most you’re allowed to; everything more is detrimental to your health.
Or: 
Some seventy years ago, in the midst of the darkest stage of recent history (the Holocaust), Viktor Frankl discovered that 
 makes life worthwhile.
Okinawans seem to have known this since time immemorial – they call it 
 which, loosely translated corresponds to the French “raison d’etre,” a reason for being.
Literally, 
 can be translated as “the thing that you live for” and bears pretty much the same connotations as the Nicoyans 
, a life plan.
Buettner translates both more precisely with a very profound phrase: “why I wake up in the morning.”
Without an answer to that question, there’s a chance that you’ll spend at least ten years fewer on this planet that the Blue Zones inhabitants.
Here’s what you can do to change that:
. It is not only for a CV: answer the question “Why do you get up in the morning?” so that you get up with a purpose every day.
 
.
Humans are social animals, and a purpose 
 communicated with someone is a purpose barely existent.
. Taking up a musical instrument or learning a new language is the best way to preserve your mental sharpness.
Or: 
They don’t call it the silent killer for no reason: stress is everything you don’t need in your life.
“People who’ve made it to 100 seem to exude a sense of sublime serenity,” writes Dan Buettner. “Part of it is that their bodies naturally slow down as they have aged, but they’re also wise enough to know that many of life’s most precious moments pass us by if we’re lurching blindly toward some goal.”
Meditation, mindfulness, yoga – do what you can but whatever you do, 
 as soon as you can: tortoises live longer than you for a reason.
Here’s Buettner’s (and the Blue Zones’) 
:
. Television, podcasts, the Internet – we know they take up a big portion of your time; apparently, you should read that sentence literally, because minimizing time spent with them lengthens life twofold.
. Plan to arrive 15 minutes early wherever you go. This minimizes stress and allows you to slow down.
. At least 10 minutes a day – and, if possible, even 30. 
.
Or: 
Centenarians in the Blue Zones seem to share another thing between them: faith. 
They believe in many different things, and they do so in many different manners; and, apparently, it doesn’t even matter if you are Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, or Hindu; what does matter is that you believe and belong to a strong religious community.
“The simple act of worship,” writes Buettner, “is one of those subtly powerful habits that seems to improve your chances of having more good years.”
Here are three strategies on how to achieve this:
. Take a more active role in the organization you are already a member of.
. “If you don’t have a particular religious faith,” writes Buettner, “commit to trying a new faith community.” It doesn’t even have to do a lot with god: Unitarian Universalism, for example, is a liberal religion which is characterized as a “free and responsible search for truth and meaning.”
. Whatever you choose, however, don’t be a believer in the solitude of your thoughts; just go to religious services and do so with an open mind.
Or: 
“The most successful centenarians we met in the Blue Zones,” informs Dan Buettner, “put their families first. They tended to marry, have children, and build their lives around that core. Their lives were imbued with familial duty, ritual, and a certain emphasis on togetherness.”
And these four tips can help you create your family’s Blue Zone:
. 
 a family is not the same as 
 a family; create an environment of togetherness within a smaller house.
. One family meal a day and one family vacation a year is the minimum.
. Choose at least one day a year during which you’ll project photographs of your family on the wall and discuss them with your loved ones.
. That’s self-explanatory, but it seems that in the 21
 century, it just needs to be repeated over and over again.
Or: 
You know what they say: your immediate surroundings make a large part of who you are – 
.
That’s why finding your tribe is perhaps “the most powerful thing you can do to change your lifestyle for the better.”
A thorn between roses starts smelling better, but a rose between thorns withers away.
So, build up the Inner Circle of your Blue Zone using these three strategies:
. Find the people who reinforce your good habits and put an X next to those who do the opposite.
. Grumpy people live shorter.
. Spend at least 30 minutes a day with members of your inner circle: a meeting, a meal, a brief discussion; after all, these are the very guys you want to take your walking date from lesson one!
Key Lessons from “The Blue Zones”
1.      The Blue Zones of the World Are Its Confirmed Longevity Hotspots
2.      There Are Five Exceptional Blue Zones on the Earth (and One of Them Is in the USA) 
3.      These Are the Nine Lessons for Living Longer
The Blue Zones of the World Are Its Confirmed Longevity Hotspots
Look “blue zone” up on Wikipedia, and you’ll find Dan Buettner’s name in its very definition.
And that’s because “Blue Zones are regions of the world where Dan Buettner claims people live much longer than average.”
There Are Five Exceptional Blue Zones on the Earth (and One of Them Is in the USA) 
According to Dan Buettner, there are five blue zones on our planet:
#1. Sardinia, Italy;
#2. Okinawa, Japan;
#3. Loma Linda, California;
#4. Nicoya, Costa Rica; and
#5. Icaria, Greece.
These Are the Nine Lessons for Living Longer
After studying the life habits of the people from these five blue zones, Dan Buettner distilled nine lessons for living longer, i.e., habits which would probably add years to your life and life to your years.
These are the Blue Zones activities which you should mimic:
#1. Moderate and regular physical activity;
#2. Hari hachi bu: eating up to when you’re 80% full;
#3. Avoiding meat and processed food in favor of plants;
#4. Drinking red wine (in moderation);
#5. Having a purpose in life, or: knowing why you get up in the morning;
#6. Taking time to relieve stress;
#7. Participating in a spiritual community;
#8. Putting your family first; and
#9. Surrounding yourself with the right tribe of people.

Who Should Read “Everything is Obvious”? And Why?
Drawing on the very latest findings in the social sciences, 
 reveals some things which, as its blurb states, have “important implications in politics, business, and marketing, as well as in science and everyday life.”
Consequently, it is not an exaggeration to say that this book is for everyone. You’ll enjoy it very much if you like to read about biases and prejudices, about human behavior and the problems with future predictions.
Everything is Obvious Summary
PART I COMMON SENSE
“Common sense is so ordinary that we tend to notice it only when it’s missing,” notes Duncan James Watts in the first chapter of 
And just like many ordinary things which are around us all the time—like, say, time itself—it is also pretty difficult to define it.
“Roughly speaking,” informs us Watts, common sense “is the loosely organized set of facts, observations, experiences, insights, and pieces of received wisdom that each of us accumulates over a lifetime, in the course of encountering, dealing with, and learning from, everyday situations.”
In practical terms, it is what tells you to 
go to work 
 on, or, say, cheat your trusting friend out of his money. It is what lies buried inside proverbs, aphorisms, and saying—you know, the obvious thing.
Interestingly enough, as sociologists are fond of pointing out pretty often, many of these aphorisms appear to be direct contradictions of each other. 
For example, birds of a feather flock together, but opposites attract. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, but out of sight is out of mind. Look before you leap, but, then again, he who hesitates is lost.  
“Of course,” notes Watts, “it is not necessarily the case that these beliefs are contradictory—because we invoke different aphorisms in different circumstances. But because we never specify the conditions under which one aphorism applies versus another, we have no way of describing what it is that we really think or why we think it.”
“Common sense,” he concludes, “is not so much a worldview as a grab bag of logically inconsistent, often contradictory beliefs, each of which seems right at the time but carries no guarantee of being right any other time.”
Of course, if something is a grab bag of logically inconsistent beliefs, and if that grab bag is carried by virtually every human on this planet, then we’re bound to misuse it—and it seems, we do this quite often.
Watts is not talking about day-to-day situations: everyday life, he says, is effectively broken up into small problems, grounded in very specific contexts, and in cases such as these, using your common sense is quite harmless, even beneficial.
However, when we use common sense to solve problems that are 
 grounded in “the immediate 
”—that’s when we’re bound to make serious mistakes.
What kind of problems are we talking about?
Well, practically every problem which involves us “anticipating or managing the behavior of large numbers of people, in situations that are distant from us either in time or space.”
You’ve never done this?
What about every single discussion you’ve had about politics, or economics, or the Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, or the healthcare plan?
Well, sorry to burst your bubble, but what you were doing in most of these cases was nothing short of ridiculous: applying your common sense to talk about problems such as these is as wrong as applying nail polish to your eyes. 
Simply put, that’s 
what common sense is for. And some people—the actual politicians and economists—do this all the time. And there—now you know why there are so many problems around the world.
The main problem with common sense is this: when you use it wrong, it doesn’t allow you for a minute to see that you’re wrong, because, simply put, that is also part of its job.
And 
 and 
 have repeatedly demonstrated to us that 
 because our brain is haunted by a host of thinking demons called biases which can easily be turned against us by people who know how to command them.
One way to do this is to 
 these demons in the preferable direction, by making the option you’d like for another one to make the default one.
Don’t believe it works?
Consider this: in Germany, only one in ten people (about 12%) agreed to be an organ donor over the course of one year. In Austria, on the other hand, ten in ten (99%) did that.
Why? What could be so different about these two countries, populated by virtually the same people?
Well, just one small thing: in Austria, the default choice is to be an organ donor, whereas in Germany the default is 
 to be. 
Watts writes: “The difference in policies seems trivial—it’s just the difference between having to mail in a simple form and not having to—but it’s enough to push the donor rate from 12 percent to 99.9 percent.”
And it’s not an isolated case: “what was true for Austria and Germany was true across all of Europe—all the countries with very high rates of organ donation had opt-out policies, while the countries with low rates were all opt-in.”
Another way to trick another person into doing something he/she might not like is through a technique called priming, i.e., influencing a decision with particular words, sounds, or other stimuli.
For example, subjects in experiments who read words like “old” and “frail” walk more slowly down the corridor when they leave the lab compared to those who read words such as “young” and “vivacious.” 
Also, consumers in wine stores are more likely to buy German wine when German music is playing in the background, and French wine when French music is playing; 
Possibly even stranger, when asked about energy drinks, consumers are more likely to name “Gatorade” when given a green pen in order to fill out a given survey. 
Finally—and most fascinatingly—”shoppers looking to buy a couch online are more likely to opt for an expensive, comfortable-looking couch when the background of the website is of fluffy white clouds, and more likely to buy the harder, cheaper option when the background consists of dollar coins.”
Still think that couch you bought and the wine you’ll be drinking tonight was your choice?
There’s yet a third technique to influence someone else’s common sense thinking. 
It’s called anchoring, and it basically consists of skewing the response of another person in the desired direction by giving him 
 numerical information.
That’s what the “suggested donation” is for: to make you give—and you will, almost always—at least as much or more than the suggested amount.
Have you ever given less?
We neither.
Already afraid that you’re being willfully manipulated by your common sense (and by those who know how it works) on a daily basis?
The bad news is that Watts is not done with the biases and all the failings of these common sense thinking methods.
As the title suggests, in the third chapter, he goes over some of the reasons why there are things such as tulipomania and speculative bubbles, exploring the wisdom—and much more 
—of crowds.
Ask anyone which is the most beautiful painting in the world, and he/she will probably tell you that it’s Da Vinci’s 
.
Ask him why and he/she is bound to offer some explanations: the enigmatic smile, the perfect use of light, the fantastical background, etc.
It’s, after all, commonsense knowledge, isn’t it?
That’s the problem: it’s commonsense knowledge because it is commonsense knowledge. 
In other words, if these qualities were intrinsic to 
 and to no other painting, then it would have been easier to explain: maybe beauty is in them; however, in other paintings, these same things don’t inspire as much admiration.
To remind ourselves of the Euthyphro dilemma: “is 
 beautiful because of its beauty, or is it beautiful because people say it is?”
Unfortunately, it is the latter. Even if we say Mona Lisa is beautiful because it is a combination of all of these attributes at once, we’re once again thinking circularly.
“We claim to be saying that the Mona Lisa is the most famous painting in the world because it has attributes X, Y, 
 Z. But really what we’re saying is that the Mona Lisa is famous because it’s more like the Mona Lisa than anything else.”
In short, what you’re saying is that Mona Lisa is the best painting out there because other people have said that before you and 
you’re trying to find reasons to justify your thoughts.
This latter part is something sociologists refer to as cumulative advantage. Watts himself devised an experiment to demonstrate how it works in practice.
He divided people into two groups, asking each of the members of the groups to rate the songs they like the most. One of the groups, however—the treatment group—could 
how many times each of the songs had been downloaded.
The result?
The treatment group rated these songs higher than the others, downloading them more often than the control group!
Like it or not, the 21
 century, so far, seems to be 
, i.e., people capable of influencing whole networks of people.
The idea that such a thing is possible in the first place dates back to 1967 when Stanley Milgram did an experiment involving 300 people in two separate cities. He asked them to pass a message to a friend of theirs by first handing it over to a stranger.
His conclusions are famous to this day: on average, it took six connections for a message to reach the desired destination (hence, six degrees of separation), and nearly half of the messages passed through the hands of three individuals.
These individuals are basically what we now term influencers: they are the dream of marketers and the shortcut to fame. Pay Kim Kardashian $10,000 to tweet your product, and you’re bound to make some money.
However, Watts tried to replicate this experiment on a grander lab-free scale and discovered that one of these conclusions is wrong.
Watts and his collaborators (Roby Muhamad and Peter Dodds) used emails instead of letters and included 60,000 people in over 166 countries.
Remarkably, on average, it still took roughly seven steps for a message to reach its final recipient. However, no hubs were created: “messages reached their targets through almost as many recipients as there were chains.”
The reason why you believe that there 
such a thing as an influencer is common sense: it sounds reasonable that there are some people who are more connected than others. 
The truth is that, in real-life networks, we each play an important role in spreading information and paying $10,000 to Kim Kardashian for a single tweet may eventually amount to the same result as paying 10,000 people $1 dollar for 10,000 tweets.
“The only thing we learn from history,” quipped once George Bernard Shaw, “is that we learn nothing from history.”
Well, sociologists now know that this is true. But, they say, it is not because we don’t pay enough attention or because we don’t know our history enough; it is the opposite: we pay too much attention, and we think we know too much about our history.
History, unfortunately, is run only once and we can’t turn back the time. Consequently, it is the very opposite of an experiment: nothing we claim to have learned from it is the result of rigorous testing.
Put simpler, the same people act differently in two different contexts. So why should the same events—or even strings of events—cause the same consequences if they happen in two different periods of time?
Naturally, they won’t. We just think they would.
And, once again, the culprit is our common sense: intuitively, we think that we know precisely what caused what, but unlike the people who lived through these events, we analyze them in retrospect. 
And there’s a big difference: the people who actually lived through them couldn’t have seen what we think they must have.
It’s even more frightening than this: history is told by people with biases in narrative sentences. And narrative sentences murk the difference between myth and reality, something which is further muddled by the interests of the chronicler.
Add to this that it is the winners who write history and you’re in quite the pickle: has anything that ever happened really happened in the way we think it did?
And if we can’t tell so many things about the past, how are we so sure that we can predict the future—something central to planning, policy, strategy, management, marketing, etc.?
Well, that’s once again our common sense leading us astray: future, as 
common sense, is absolutely unpredictable (anything can happen at any time), and numerous people have learned this the hard way.
For example, thousands and thousands of them have lost money investing in things investors told them would inevitably bring them some fast cash. Something happens, though, and the money is suddenly lost.
After it happens, there are many people who’d tell you what the original problem was. However, just taking into consideration what we told you above about history and hindsight, how do we know if these people knew beforehand or are just predicting things 
 the events?
Well, if you ask Nassim Nicholas Taleb whom Watts quotes, the answer should be fairly obvious: it is the latter, aka the people who say they had known something would happen beforehand, are merely lying to themselves.
Because of two unshakably real things: 
.
As defined by Wikipedia, survivorship bias is the “logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility.”
In other words, out of a million people who’d attempt to predict a future, it is statistically very likely that at least a few would guess right. The problem: you’d 
 hear about them.
But 
 
would probably fail to predict the black swan events, i.e., events so unpredictable that nobody believes when they happen. (Hence the name: European settlers in Australia were stunned to find out that there 
black swans, contrary to a popular commonsense Roman saying.)
To wrap up, before 9/11, nobody could have predicted the attack. But how should we organize ourselves to be safe against them?
PART II UNCOMMON SENSE
So, predicting things your common sense says are predictable is almost impossible—for two reasons: there are multiple possible futures, and we’re focusing on one, 
 there are billions of unimportant things that influence other things, and we can only think of the things that matter.
In addition, “predicting black swans is… doubly hopeless,” notes Watts, “because until history has played out, it’s impossible even to know what the relevant terms are.”
However, as any good poker player can tell you, even though “counting cards won’t tell you exactly which card is going to show up next… by knowing the odds better than your opponents, you can still make a lot of money over time by placing more informed bets and winning more often than you lose.”
And that’s precisely why some predictions—whether in poker or sporting events—work better than the rest: they take part in something called the prediction market.
The prediction market is basically the survivorship bias turned on its head: you take into account 
 of the predictions, and that helps you make better-informed forecast.
This is what James Surowiecki dubs “
”: “although individual people tend to make highly error-prone predictions when lots of these estimates are averaged together, the errors have a tendency to cancel out.” Hence, the prediction market will always be “smarter” than its constituents.
However, the prediction market is not that helpful when it comes to large, strategic decisions—the ones made by governments and corporations from time to time. The reason is simple: these events do not occur with high frequency.
If you want to be more resilient in cases such as these, you’re better off planning for individual outcomes (i.e., multiple futures). But, how many outcomes should you plan for ahead?
More often than not, you’d think that plans fail because planners— whether government planners trying to reduce global poverty or advertising planners trying to launch a new campaign for a client—ignore common sense.
But that’s what your common sense tells you to think after the fact: “of course it went wrong,” you say, “they didn’t take into account the thing I, from the future, can see that 
 
taken into account.”
In fact, it’s the other way around: planners fail “because they rely on 
 own common sense to reason about the behavior of people who are different from them.”
This seems like an easy trap to avoid—but, Watts says, it isn’t. 
“We will always be tempted to think that we know how other people will react to a new product, or to a politician’s campaign speech, or to a new tax law. ‘It’ll never work,’ we will want to say, ‘because people just don’t like that kind of thing,’ or ‘No one will be fooled by his obvious chicanery,’ or ‘Such a tax will reduce incentives to work hard and invest in the economy.’” 
None of this can be helped, apparently: “we cannot suppress our commonsense intuition any more than we can will our heart to stop beating.”
So, what 
 we do?
Simple: we can remember that “whenever it comes to questions of business strategy or government policy, or even marketing campaigns and website design, we must rely 
 on our common sense and 
 on what we can measure.”
Just like in the prediction market: more data means better judgments. 
 data means making nothing more than common sense decisions, i.e., what you would have made without any sort of data to start with.
It’s pretty obvious what you 
do, isn’t it?
What very few people tell you is that luck plays a large part in the way you’re treated in society, because even our understanding about fairness and justice is profoundly dependent on the oftentimes unforeseeable outcome of some events.
Consider this example: a driver kills four people, including an unborn child. It is later discovered that he had been drinking with his friends and that he is a police officer. Of course, he is tried and sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison.
He is widely criticized for his behavior, and very few people find even a single good word for him. 
The problem?
Well, how many times have you driven your car after a night out drinking? What if you had killed someone? 
Still, you 
 and the man from the example—he is real, and his name is Joseph Gray—did. You’re still considered an honest and good person. He, even though he has served as a police officer, is (and quite justly) not.
The point of this thought experiment is simple: random luck has a real and very tangible effect on our lives. Many studies (in addition to the 
) have shown that people of similar talent end up at very different levels of success, and 
.
That’s why the debate between Nozick and Rawls about what constitutes a just society is basically pointless: they are talking about two different things.
In the natural world, the libertarian Nozick might be right: to everyone what he has worked for. 
However, we live in a society, so the liberal John Rawls is the only one who makes sense: a just society should minimize the effect of random luck on inequality.
People have always longed to know things. 
And, in the case of some disciplines, they can be fairly sure that they 
know them: physics and chemistry are, more or less, exact sciences, and their findings are confirmed by repeatable experiments.
Unfortunately, sociology and anthropology, for example, are fairly different: they study man, and man is not only ever-changeable creature but a host of billions of unique personalities.
That’s why many of the social and psychological experiments some smart people have done in the past may be just plain wrong: as the author has shown by repeating Stanley Milgram’s “six degrees of separation” experiment, what works for 300 people may not work for 60,000. And what about 6 billion?
Fortunately, we live in a day and age where we can finally analyze data better: Twitter, Facebook, and search engine queries offer sociologists invaluable treasure trove of data and their findings because based on larger specimens, are inevitably more correct.
What they have already discovered is simple: common sense answers to complex questions are, more often than not, wrong. 
“Just as the invention of the telescope revolutionized the study of the heavens,” concludes Watts, “so too by rendering the unmeasurable measurable, the technological revolution in mobile, Web, and Internet communications has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of ourselves and how we interact.”
Key Lessons from “Everything is Obvious”
1.      Common Sense Works in Everyday Situations—But Not in Situations Which Really Matter
2.      We Should Uncommon Our Sense to Solve Our Problems
3.      Social Science Has Discovered Its Telescope—and It’s Something Rather Banal
Common Sense Works in Everyday Situations—But Not in Situations Which Really Matter
Common sense is something you need no definition for: it’s the first thing that pops into your brain in any given situation, the obvious answers to the questions of life.
Fortunately, common sense is a powerful mechanism which helps people deal with everyday problems; unfortunately, the very same mechanisms (intuition, generalizations, fast thinking) that help you safely get through your day are the reasons why economists and politicians have caused so much unnecessary suffering.
Put simply, when it comes to important, large-scale strategic decisions which involve anticipation and prediction—common sense does us many disfavors.
We Should Uncommon Our Sense to Solve Our Problems
Consequently, if we want to solve serious problems, we need to use something Watts refers to as the uncommon sense, i.e., to use the things we know about the deficiencies of our common sense (which we know via social experiments) and transform them into advantages.
Things such as the prediction market and redistribution of wealth (and other things) work—but are merely the start of a long journey toward a just, resilient, future-proof society.
Social Science Has Discovered Its Telescope—and It’s Something Rather Banal
Robert Merton—the eminent social scientist, and not 
—once noted that social science hasn’t found its Kepler and its telescope, i.e., the tool which would revolutionize the field.
Duncan Watts think that we’ve finally happened upon it. And it’s the thing you’d least expect to be: social media networks, Google search queries, the cloud.
Because of these things, social scientists nowadays have the privilege to deal with much, much larger sets of data than their predecessors could. 
And that, Watts, believes, has already started a revolution.

Who Should Read “Inventology”? And Why?
If you want to learn what is it that makes an inventor a bit different from the other people or you want to become one, then 
 is the right book for you.
It is a great addition to a budding field of study – and inventology is a great name for it – which includes books like

and even 
If you like this book, be sure to check the others as well.
Inventology Summary
As its subtitle aptly suggests, 
 is a “delightful account” of how we dream up things that change the world; hence the neologism from the title which can be roughly translated as “the science of inventions.”
Pagan Kennedy’s book is divided into five parts: “Problem Finding,” “Discovery,” “Prophecy,” “Connecting” and “Empowerment,” each of which contains between two and four chapters.
Not all of the titles of the sections below mirror the titles of the chapters in 
 – neither we have the time and space to cover them all.
However – and as always – we did cover what we found most interesting and most engaging.
Enjoy!
Part I: Problem Finding
Part I of 
 delves into 
.
“We will look at how creative people,” the author writes, “use their frustration as a doorway into the imagination.”
“According to an old saw,” she goes on, “necessity is the mother of invention; that’s certainly true, but the adage is annoyingly vague. What kind of necessity works best to help reveal the outlines of a hidden problem? Why do some frustrations lead to a big idea, while most don’t? And can we learn from someone else’s pain?”
Let’s find answers to these questions.
Imagine having to carry your 32kg luggage by hand; even more – imagine having to carry two 32kg suitcases in the same manner?
Seems exhausting to even think about it, doesn’t it?
Well, most probably, your parents and grandparents had to do exactly that!
Even though such an important part of the lives of so many regular travelers of the world, wheeled suitcases are a pretty recent invention.
The first suitcase designed for airports is not even half a century old and dates back to 1970, when Bernard D. Sadow, a vice president at a luggage company had to schlepp two heavy suitcases to an airport.
And then he noticed a workman pushing a machine on a dolly.
Cue a lightbulb moment: after devising a prototype or two, very soon Sadow patented a suitcase that sat squarely on rollers, with a flexible strap attached to it.
Carrying this suitcase was pretty much similar like walking your dog: you pulled it behind on a leash, but you also had to be careful not to pull it too hard – otherwise you might end up hitting yourself. 
Enter Robert Plath, an airline pilot.
About a decade after Sadow’s invention, he introduced quite a few improvements which made the wheeled suitcase the beloved commodity that is today.
In retrospect, one is bound to ask himself/herself a question: why didn’t Sadow think of these improvements?
The answer, writes Pagan Kennedy, is quite simple.
For Bernard Sadow – being a businessman on vacation – the wheeled suitcase was a “short-term form of necessity.” 
However, Plath, by virtue of his job, “Plath was already living in the future, when flying would become a commonplace misery.”
That’s why he was 
 to think deeply about this problem: he had to deal with it on a daily basis.
As we have already reminded you, in 
 (1776), Adam Smith uses a famous pin factory study to suggest that “division of labor is an incredibly effective way to achieve higher efficiency in the production process.”
Smith goes a step further: in a pin factory where one man does one job only, he says, each laborer becomes an expert in a small field, and this may eventually result in him finding out “easier and readier methods of performing” his job.
In other words, according to Adam Smith, in addition to increasing productivity, specialization also turns all workmen into inventors.
And he even offers an example.
“For instance,” relates Kennedy, “he noticed a boy who was supposed to pump a lever in time with a piston. This relentless, grinding task inspired the boy to figure out an ingenious workaround: he tied a string between the lever and a moving part elsewhere on the machine. Now the machine itself pulled the lever for him. After automating his job, the boy skipped off to play with friends.”
Many years later – i.e., about a decade ago – the American economist Eric von Hippel put this otherwise: “I’ve learned personally that you can get a graduate student to do a lot of things, but you can’t get them to do it twenty thousand times in a row, [because] they will start to invent.”
In other words, nobody likes to do mechanical things forever; and, after a certain number of hours, he/she turns into a Lead User, an inventor out of frustration.
This is the reason why mountain bikes were invented by bike hobbyists who had to ride over boulders and tree stumps in the woods.
Since he had worked both as an engineer and as an academic, Ernst Hippel used his experiences from his previous field to devise a now-famous academic theory on the genesis of lead users.
Theoretically, anyone who encounters a frustrating problem lacking an off-the-shelf solution can become one; however, the most valuable kind of frustration seems to be the one which has these three components:
#1. It plays out over a long period of time, thus inspiring more and better solutions;
#2. It reveals a hidden problem that is difficult to detect;
#3. It forecasts a problem that will affect thousands or millions of people in the future.
Let us sum up this for you:
Want to become an inventor?
Just start doing something many people are doing but is considered boring – over and over again; after some time, you’d grow tired of doing that; and that’s when you’ll suddenly start thinking like an inventor.
Part II: Discovery
If Part I deals with problem finding and people who have a deep understanding of a problem, Part II turns its attention to inventors who operate in exactly the opposite manner.
Namely, people who “stumble across a ‘preexisting solution,’ and then they work backward to figure out how to match it to a need.”
Let’s find out more about the role of serendipity in the creative process.
They say that while the unsuccessful ones look for excuses and consider themselves unlucky, the successful ones are capable of making their own luck.
But is it true?
Well, according to quite a few experiments, it isn’t wrong.
For example, in the 1990s, a British psychology professor by the name of Richard Wiseman “began to suspect that people who feel “lucky” tend to be especially observant—and that their ability to scan their surroundings makes it easier for them to notice useful clues in their environment.”
To test out his theory, he devised a simple experiment.
First, he gathered two groups of people: some who considered themselves lucky and blessed, and others cursed and unlucky. Then he gave them a newspaper asking them to count the number of photographs inside.
The trick?
On the second page, there was a small note saying: “Stop counting – there are 43 photographs in this newspaper.”
Unsurprisingly, the blessed ones noticed this message much more often than the cursed ones.
A lucky coincidence?
 would beg to differ.
In a famous experiment, he gathered a group of art students and asked them to pick out and draw objects from a previously set-up room.
One group treaded the easier path: they started drawing immediately, the first thing they noticed; the other group took time and started drawing only after carefully examining the objects in the room.
Seven years later, the former were struggling to meet ends, and most of the latter became professional artists.
Back in the 1990s, Sanda Erdelez devised a name for the more observant, lucky ones.
She named them the Super-Encounterers.
Their main trait: they 
the search, boasting “channels for information perception that are more sensitive than the channels of other[s].”
Are you one of them?
Super-Encounterers make their own luck by 
 and, thus, 
 more things than other people. 
If you read that sentence carefully and didn’t skip the title of this section, you already know something scientists just discovered: an inventor with a proper algorithm is a better inventor than a Super-Encounterer or a Lead User.
Why?
Well, two words:
.
It means exactly what you think it means: millions and billions of articles systemized in such a manner that makes them searchable within days – or even hours.
Hence, one should not be surprised by a new breed of inventors currently active in laboratories and universities worldwide: the bioinformaticians.
These people, in the words of Kennedy, “hope to find a way to speed up and engineer their luck by using computers to scan the results of thousands of past experiments in order to detect unexpected connections.”
Has it worked?
Of course it has!
Consider a drug called imipramine, an antidepressant around for more than half a century.
Using big-data-mining algorithms, Atul Butte – a biomedical researcher and entrepreneur who heads up the University of California San Francisco’s Institute for Computational Health Sciences – discovered a pattern which suggested that imipramine could be effective in fighting small-cell lung cancer.
A few experiments later, and this was published as a fact in the journal 
Now, it’s not like someone else couldn’t have stumbled upon this patter while reading a few of these articles; however, deliberate focus, basically, works as an instigator of serendipity.
Which means that bioinformaticians are 
creating their own luck.
“Nothing will come out of nothing,” wrote Shakespeare in 
at the beginning of the 17
 century.
“You don’t say!” – replied the little-known Lawrence Herbert in the 1960s.
A recent Hofstra University graduate, in 1956, Herbert was hired by the brothers Morris and Jesse Levine at their advertising company as a part-time employee.
Since he was put in charge of the ink and printing division – and he knew a bit of chemistry – Herbert noticed something devastating.
Namely, because “every designer had about a half a dozen color books in his drawer” and because “every ink company used different sets of pigments which react differently under different lights,” he couldn’t be sure what color he would get when sending out orders for ink.
So, he thought of a brilliant solution: what if, he began to imagine, all printers and ink makers could speak a universal language?
Under this scheme, he remembers, “if somebody in New York wanted something printed in Tokyo, they would just simply open up the book and say, ‘Give me Pantone 123.’”
And be sure that this color (a daffodil yellow) would look exactly like the one ordered.
So, Herbert created a sample page to introduce this system to other ink makers and after a bunch of “schmoozing, trading favors, and building up alliances with graphic designers and ink companies,” he devised the Pantone Matching System.
Eventually, he bought out the debt of the company he was working for and in a few decades became a multimillionaire. 
Now let’s go down a bit to make Kennedy’s point.
What Herbert started with was absolutely nothing but an idea: no money, no connections, no experience. 
And because of him, we have Pantone today.
You really think you have an excuse not to do something with your life?
Part III: Prophecy
 and 
– as you’ll see in a moment – play a big part in the process of inventing things.
That’s why Part III explores “invention as it relates to prediction, prophecy, and science-fiction dreams.”
More precisely: “What sorts of people first imagine that future? How do they do it? And how do they communicate their vision to the rest of us?”
Wayne Gretzky is the Michael Jordan of hockey; well, even more than that: there are basically no LeBrons or Kobes in hockey and with the exception of a “What-If-Lemieux,” nobody comes even close to Gretzky.
He is universally acclaimed as the greatest hockey player ever.
You know why?
Because he was able to anticipate, to predict the movement of the puck better than the rest, i.e., because he saw a second more into the future than those around him.
Great inventors share this capability.
In his 
, William Blake wrote that “what is now proved was once only imagined,” and, that’s the essence of the so-called Wayne Gretzky Game.
Want to invent something people would use in the future?
Well, start off by imagining the future. If you could see, for example, flying cars there, then there is a good reason you should start working on developing one.
That’s exactly what happened with a bunch of people in the 1970s: they were able to see a personal computer in everyone’s home when barely few had even seen one.
Yup, we’re talking about a story we’ve already recounted in our summaries: 
Now, if you’ve read our summary of 
,
you already know full well that it was a Vannevar Bush essay that inspired Engelbart that inspired Microsoft and Apple.
What if that essay not only 
but also 
the future?
It is more than possible.
Just think of the more-than-famous 
, according to which computing power doubles every year and a half.
According to its very postulator, even though originally an observation, it has turned into a directive: people in the industry 
 to fall behind it.
Thus, Gordon Moore has both predicted and shaped the future.
Unfortunately, Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla – aka the man who brought us the 21
 century –didn’t have that much luck in his life: he died, quite poor, alone and forgotten, in a hotel room in New York in January 1943.
Fortunately, at least since the 1990s, he has not only been lifted from obscurity but turned into the archetypal brilliant scientist ahead of his time and capable of devising inventions basically at will.
And for a reason: Tesla was indeed capable of doing this, his laboratory being more mental than an actual one.
“Every night (and sometimes during the day), when alone, I would start on my journeys – see new places, cities, and countries –live there, meet people and make friendships and acquaintances,” he wrote later in his life.
“This I did constantly until I was about seventeen when my thoughts turned seriously to invention. Then I observed to my delight that I could visualize with the greatest facility. I needed no models, drawings, or experiments. I could picture them all as real in my mind. Thus, I have been led unconsciously to evolve what I consider a new method of materializing inventive concepts and ideas.” 
“Before I put a sketch on paper,” Tesla concludes, “the whole idea is worked out mentally. In my mind, I change the construction, make improvements, and even operate the device.”
In a way, that’s exactly what you should start doing right away – don’t make us requote William Blake here as well.
However, be careful not to go overboard and become a Robert Desnos, a French Surrealist poet who, whenever asleep, put a sign before his door stating that “the Poet is working;” how would we know if you don’t put that on paper, Robert?
Part IV: Connecting
“In Part IV of this book,” writes Kennedy, “we will look at how invention benefits from open systems, and specifically from the people who thrive in a connected world. Breakthroughs often happen when we allow unlikely collaborators and odd bedfellows to share our problems, or when we leap across boundaries.”
Consider, for example, John Harrison, an 18
-century British carpenter, and clockmaker.
In 1714, seven years after the disastrous Scilly shipwreck which claimed the lives of thousands because of bad naval navigation, members of British Parliament promised to award a fortune ($3 million in today’s dollars) to one capable of improving it.
John Harrison was the guy who claimed the prize, producing a marine clock accurate down to the second. This clock allowed sailors “to calculate longitude by comparing the precise clock readings with the position of the stars and the sun; it was time, as much as celestial maps, that turned out to be key to solving the problem.”
Why was the humble John Harrison – of all people – capable of making such a breakthrough?
Simply put, because he was able to bring together knowledge from more than one relevant field: he was able to both craft gears and springs with precision, but he was also able to connect his knowledge of timekeeping with navigation.
As Kennedy says, there “are certain people who – by luck, design, or some quirk of personality – are able to bring together knowledge from several fields. They inhabit the cracks and interstices between different disciplines.”
And, ultimately, they are capable of making leaps others can’t even imagine.
Part V: Empowerment
Part V of 
 explores “the challenges of empowerment.”
“It takes enormous courage to claim a problem,” Kennedy writes. “When you dare to tackle a big question, you may face ridicule, rejection, and opposition. So how do you grant yourself permission to invent?”
Look no further than the Soviet engineer, inventor, and scientist Genrich Altshuller.
He was a brilliant young man – possibly even just too brilliant for his own sake under a totalitarian regime.
An SF enthusiast – later in life, he basically earned his living writing science fiction novels in collaboration with his wife – Altshuller dreamt of a world far different than the one haunted by Stalin’s Great Purge.
He dreamt of a world where everyone can be an inventor.
So, after noticing the drop in inventions in USSR, soon after the Second World War, together with his friend Raphael Shapiro, he wrote a letter to Stalin in which he advocated such a form of education.
Abbreviated as TRIZ, this new educative practice is still described as “a problem-solving, analysis and forecasting tool derived from the study of patterns of invention in the global patent literature.”
Questioning Stalin’s method was never a great idea, and it was especially not so in 1950. So, Altshuller and Shapiro ended up in a labor camp.
Did this make him give up his dreams?
On the contrary: it merely fueled him to work more and more.
After he was freed by Khrushchev three years later, Altshuller continued reviewing patents to develop several still-studied and used concepts in innovation: the ideality of a system, technical contradictions, and contradiction matrix and the 40 principles of TRIZ, the general principles of invention.
You’d think he died a rich man, wouldn’t you?
Guess again: he didn’t want any money.
Altshuller just wanted a better world for everybody.
Key Lessons from “Inventology”
1.      Everyone Can Become a Lead User and an Inventor
2.      Play the Wayne Gretzky Game (It’s Not Hockey) and Become an Inventor
3.      Connect Two Disparate Fields of Endeavor to See the World Differently
Everyone Can Become a Lead User and an Inventor
Adam Smith was the first to notice that regular laborers can become inventors when they specialize enough doing a certain task.
Centuries after him, Ernst von Hippel devised the lead user theory to explain how this came to be.
Simply put, if a job can be automated and breeds frustration in the one who’s tasked doing it, then, after a certain number of repetitions (say, 20,000), the worker starts thinking like an inventor.
In other words, he starts thinking of ways to ease his burden.
And isn’t that exactly what inventors do?
Play the Wayne Gretzky Game (It’s Not Hockey) and Become an Inventor
Wayne Gretzky is widely considered the greatest hockey player in history for a reason: he was able to anticipate and predict the movement of a puck much better than anyone else.
Well, most inventors are just like that: they are able to predict the future much better than us, regular Joes.
That’s what the Wayne Gretzky Game is all about.
Think of it this way: problem solving, by definition, deals with obvious things, i.e., problems which are a manifestation of the current worldview.
In the Wayne Gretzky Game, you imagine the world few decades in the future, and then you figure out the technology “destined to exist, based on what you’d predicted about the evolution of machines and about human needs and desires.”
And then it’s time for sketches, videos, and stories about the technology.
In other words, using the Wayne Gretzky Game, you do not deal with solving current problems but envisioning and solving the problems of the future.
Isn’t that better?
Connect Two Disparate Fields of Endeavor to See the World Differently
A guy named John Harrison became an instant millionaire at the beginning of the 18
 century because he was not only a carpenter and a clockmaker, but also knew something about naval navigation.
This allowed him to build a marine clock accurate down to the second and claim a hefty prize for the invention from the British Parliament.
Why was he able to come up with one?
Simply put: “by luck, design, or some quirk of personality,” he fused together knowledge from different disciplines.
Think of it this way: how many people there were in the 18
 century capable of crafting clocks and knowing a thing or two about naval navigation?

: 
by Onnit founder Aubrey Marcus is an all-in-one manual for “total human optimization,” providing a bunch of valuable pieces of advice on everything from waking and eating a good breakfast through working and training more efficiently to acquiring proper sleeping habits and having more and better sex.
Who Should Read “Own the Day, Own Your Life”? And Why?
is for everybody who has at least one shelf of his/her home library filled with about twenty how-to manuals for diet, health, work efficiency, sex life, etc.
Well, this book can replace them all.
“The best way to change your life is to change what your life is made up of – your rituals, your habits, how you eat and think,” writes Ryan Holiday in his review of 
. “This book is a road map for doing exactly that, written by an author whose results can’t be argued with.”
Own the Day, Own Your Life Summary
Even if you have never heard of Aubrey Marcus, you probably already know a lot about Onnit, “one of the fastest-growing human performance companies in America.”
Well, Aubrey Marcus is the guy who founded the company about a decade ago; also, the guy who popularized the concept of “total human optimization” which is exactly what this 500-page mammoth of a book is all about.
Let’s put it this way: its subtitle – Optimized Practices for Waking, Working, Learning, Eating, Training, Playing, Sleeping, and Sex – is definitely not an exaggeration.
So, what are we waiting for?
1: Water. Light. Morning
Aubrey Marcus’ book begins with a quote from none other than 
: “well begun is half done.” For a reason: the first chapter is dedicated to waking up and the things which happen in the half hour after. 
“How you wake up sets the tone for your day,” writes Marcus. “Do you slide out of bed and slink through your social media, or do you have purpose in your actions?”
When put this way, it’s not a choice, is it?
And yet – you go on making the wrong one.
“We are highly sensitive to momentum,” notes Marcus. “By starting your morning off with intention, you set your day off on an important positive trajectory.”
Want us to put this as simple as 1-2-3?
Here it is:
#1. Hydrate immediately, because most of us are chronically dehydrated, especially in the morning (after 7 hours of sleep in a dry climate, what would you expect?); do not – we repeat – 
drink any coffee!
#2. Then seek light – but not artificial one: open the blinds and stop being a bat;
#3. Finally, get moving to reset your internal clock.
Now, your day is “primed for perfection.”
2: Deep Breath, Deep Freeze
“Breath and the cold are the best friends you never knew you had,” writes Marcus at the beginning of the second chapter of 
.
Really, you say? Have has he ever spend at least two hours in a hot morning or evening shower?
Yes, he has, in fact, and has realized that it is too cozy and comfortable to be good for your health and wellbeing.
The key word here is 
.
In scientific terms, 
 is “a biological phenomenon in which low-dose exposure to an environmental agent (called a ‘hormetic stressor’) produces a beneficial effect, while a higher-dose exposure produces a toxic effect.”
In layman’s terms, this “odd duality” has been best summed up by 
’s famous maxim: “What does not kill me makes me stronger.”
In other words, if you want to fight stress, fight it with a proper dose of good, acute stress, aka cold shower.
Why?
Well, simply put, “because each morning needs to involve the rush that comes with exposing yourself to nature’s extremes for a few minutes and the willpower you cultivate in the process.”
3: More Fat, Less Sugar, or Don’t Eat
Our dear old Father of the Nation, 
, once noted that you need to “eat to live” and not “live to eat.”
Marcus Aubrey starts from there and then goes on to dispel quite a few myths related to our diet.
The main two: breakfast is 
the most important meal of the day and, far from being bad, dietary fat and cholesterol are actually good for your metabolic health and proper weight.
If you don’t believe him, just look at a picture of him, and you’ll realize in the blink of an eye that he’s not lying.
In other words, if his dietary habits made his body, then it’s probably right to say that these are not bad dietary habits.
His advice?
“If you don’t have good fats and protein available to you, rather than eat a bunch of sugary or starchy foods, you can skip breakfast and reap the benefits of intermittent fasting for weight loss and longevity.”
In other words, either eat a fatty breakfast or eat no breakfast at all.
4: Essential Supplements
Now, it is easy to say skip breakfast
if the only thing you can eat is cereals, but it isn’t always like that in practice: modern life is both just too stressful and too unpredictable. 
Meaning: if you skip the cereals for breakfast, you often end up eating them for lunch (due to lack of time and the need for some instant energy), which is, of course, much, much worse.
Even though “getting the right amount of sun, sleep, and food is itself a kind of supplementation, and the first line of defense,” Aubrey notes that supplementation proper has also become something of a fact of life.
And there are two reasons why you should supplement: “to remediate potential deficiencies and to gain access to unusual or hard-to-find nutrients.”
Aubrey offers an introduction to most of them, but he wheedles out as the key things to consider supplementing these five: greens, probiotics, B vitamins, krill oil, and vitamin D.
5: Drive Time, Alive Time
No matter where you live, chances are that you spend at least an hour traveling to work every day; and probably you spend just as much traveling back.
This is what Aubrey Marcus refers to as “drive time,” and he is right in saying that for most people this “drive time” is pretty much synonymous with “dead time.”
However, it doesn’t have to be that way – at least not today.
Podcasts and audiobooks abound, and conscious breathing techniques and 
 practices are always there to help you practice greater presence and peace of mind.
Use this to your benefit.
6: The Power Plants
Though it is not good to start your day with a cup of coffee, says Aubrey Marcus, it is also a bad idea to eliminate caffeine altogether from your regular routine – because, let’s face it, it doesn’t only keep you from falling asleep during those dreadful Friday meetings but it also improves your mood on a daily basis.
Even more controversially, Marcus says that nicotine can be beneficial as well (“to focus, attention, and the enjoyment of your day”), and that the only problems with it come with the delivery.
“The problem with tobacco,” he quotes Don Howard Lawler, “is inhaling it.”
In other words, if you can get used to vaping or absorbing nicotine through your skin or your gums in healthy dosages, then, by all means, do it.
And don’t stay away from nootropics as well: the 
, for example, has been rigorously tested ever since ancient China and, apparently, it helps both with memory and cognitive performance.
Don’t believe Marcus?
Well, try it out!
7: Doin’ Work
“Find something you love to do,” 
, “and you’ll never have to work a day in your life.”
Though this is true, it is not exactly phrased well: “more important than enjoying every minute of the work you do,” notes Marcus, “is knowing 
 you are doing it. This is your mission, and being certain of that mission will allow you to flourish even in challenging situations.”
In other words, never underestimate 
: it is the difference between what is worth doing and what is not and the keyword in doing the former more creatively and more efficiently.
8: Eat a Weird Lunch
OK – that’s a bit of strange advice!
However, as you read into the chapter, you’ll realize that it is also one of the best ones you can ever hear in relation to your dietary practices.
“Lunch is an opportunity to reframe and restart your day,” writes Aubrey Marcus. “It’s not an obligation to cross off the list. It’s also an opportunity to get your body the micronutrients it needs to keep you feeling great. The way to do that isn’t with something ordered off a cart. It’s by experimenting and exploring. It’s by taking my hometown’s motto to heart, and 
 it weird.”
Put simply, don’t eat the same thing every day because that’s the easiest thing to do.
Also, don’t eat antinutrients, i.e., “highly processed, refined, burned, fried, or artificial foods and colorings.”
Just ask yourself this question: what would have been available to your ancient ancestors for lunch?
Well, eat that – and mix it up constantly.
9: The Binaural Power Nap
You know the feeling: you’ve just finished your lunch and the only thing you can do at the moment is, well, nothing; you’re just too sleepy to do anything.
Marcus Aubrey’s advice?
Listen to your body.
Instead of fighting the post-lunch nap-reflex, just go with it: just thirty minutes of sleep will recharge your batteries and restore your mental capacities to their best.
Our pretty rational tip:
Don’t eat lunch at work.
10: Training
Let’s face it: the only reason why you’re not exercising is that you’re just too lazy to do it. 
It’s not because you don’t believe the hype or doubt the benefits of good training.
Consequently, we feel no need to advocate exercising here: as Marcus Aubrey says succinctly, “exercise is a miracle drug – you just need to take it.”
Now, if you haven’t exercised before, start slowly because otherwise you’ll overtrain and overstrain yourself from the beginning.
And then move on to more difficult and, finally, more unconventional equipment: kettlebells, clubs, maces, ropes – they all work.
Make them work for 
.
11: Reset and Reconnect
Many have noted before us: modern humans are overworking themselves on a daily basis (in some Asian countries, unfortunately, they are overworking themselves to death even).
The question is – and, please, allow us to sound Shakespearean for a second – 
?
We’ve developed so many machines and tools that are actually marketed as timesaving; then why, oh why, do we lack the time for our lovers and families, for our children and our hobbies, for our dogs and our daydreaming?
As far as Marcus Aubrey (and any sane person) is concerned the above is merely a rhetorical question.
In other words: stop working so much.
When you come home from work, 
 home: leave your computer in the beg, put your phone to the charger and start connecting with your life.
Quiet down your brain with a puff of cannabis or a glass of wine and don’t hesitate to pick up an instrument and learn how to play one.
Also – have a laugh with your loved ones.
“If you spend a day without laughter and a smile, you haven’t owned the day. Because there is no destination in a well-lived life, there is only the journey.”
12: Eat Dinner Like a King
And after you’re done resetting and reconnecting to your life, it’s time to enjoy it a bit.
“After any good battle,” writes Aubrey smartly, “the warrior looks forward to a feast. And that feast is dinner.”
“Go ahead, champ, eat up and enjoy,” he goes on. “The day is not won quite yet, but you deserve this meal. Break bread, grab some popcorn, eat some chocolate and enjoy. You deserve it not just because you worked for it – but because food is a great part of life. If you go a little too far, don’t worry, we’ve got your back.”
“Eat it consciously, digest it well, and prime yourself for the best kind of dessert: sex.”
13: More, Better Sex
Speaking of…
“Wanting more sex than we normally have is part of the natural order,” writes Aubrey Marcus. “It’s when we start having less sex than we normally should, which we’re seeing now, that things really start to go sideways.”
And, in a way, they have already broken down.
The world is just too much frustrated and, apparently, even millennials (at the height of their sexual drive) are having sex less and less often.
Why is that?
Pornography, for one thing.
It’s not that you shouldn’t indulge in it from time to time – sex is good even when it is with yourself – but, let’s face it, it is not nearly as good as the real thing.
And the real thing shouldn’t be a substitute for the fake one: it should be the other way around.
So, start talking to your partner about likes and dislikes and try to rekindle the passion from the past – or create a new one if you’d prefer.
Then start exploring everything sex-related and be as adventurous as you and your partner would like. Spice things up and never forget that “attraction begins with the nose, so be careful with masking your natural smells and pheromones.”
That is – unless you need to.
14: Turn Off, Tune In
“If you don’t turn off,” writes Aubrey Marcus in yet another memorable aphorism, “you won’t ever properly turn on.”
Of course, he refers to the most addictive extension of your existence – it is not coffee, alcohol or marijuana, but (you’ve guessed it) the smartphone.
We know it’s difficult, but, boy, is unplugging your phone at night necessary for your wellbeing. Time moves fast as it is and it moves even faster when you’re endlessly scrolling down on Facebook.
So, why don’t you stop doing that?
Start a journal or something and spend the last half an hour of your day cuddling with the one you love.
That makes all the difference.
For one, you’ll fall asleep much more easily; and you’ll probably wake up feeling much more relaxed.
15: Sleep
We are so sleep-deprived nowadays that Arianna Huffington basically changed careers to instigate a 
.
And she has every right to do that because sleep is so important that it can either make or break you.
As we pointed out above – in the summary of the previous chapter – sleeping is all about finding a way to turn 
 off for a few hours.
And just like you need to keep interferences to a bare minimum to work more efficiently, you need to eliminate distractions if you’d like to have a better sleep.
This means: a relaxation pre-sleep period within a cool and completely dark room; in other words: no blue lights whatsoever!
And that’s an order!
16: Bring It Home
Changing your daily routine – 
 – means changing your life as well.
Of course, not being able to do this in a short period of time doesn’t mean the opposite: building a routine is difficult, and you need to learn how to forgive yourself if you don’t want to give up.
“Perfection is a myth,” reminds us Marcus Aubrey. “If you forgive yourself, you will begin to feel that you deserve to change for the better, and so you will.”
When in doubt, there are two ways to overcome the struggles: positive self-talk and friendship.
Consequently, the best way to start creating a personal ethos for success includes not only the decision when to start but also the act of letting everyone you love know about it, asking for their unconditional support beforehand.
That’s it.
Now, do it.

1.      If You Don’t Eat Fat, You’re Probably Fat
2.      Listen to Your Body: Take Post-Lunch Power Naps to Boost Your Productivity
3.      Boost Your Testosterone Levels for Better Sex
If You Don’t Eat Fat, You’re Probably Fat
OK, we admit that sounds counterintuitive on so many levels, but Marcus Aubrey’s almost photoshopped body is evidence enough that it might just be true.
In his opinion, breakfast is not the most important meal of the day if it consists of carbohydrates and sugars; it is far, far better to not eat anything and fast for a few hours than eat cereals in the morning.
“To restore metabolic health and optimize weight management,” he advises, “adding dietary fat back into the diet, starting with breakfast, is essential.”
Listen to Your Body: Take Post-Lunch Power Naps to Boost Your Productivity
Everybody has it: the urge to fall asleep right there on the work desk after that eagerly awaited lunch break.
Now, most books offer advices on how to struggle through it; Marcus Aubrey says otherwise: just go with it.
A 30-minute power nap in the middle of the day resets your body’s energy and your mental capacity to just about the appropriate levels.
Fighting it does nobody any good: not you, not your boss, not your company.
So, workers of the world, unite: ask your CEOs to institute an obligatory 30-minute nap period after the lunch break.
Your main argument: you’ll make up for it.
Boost Your Testosterone Levels for Better Sex
Many studies have shown that regular sex might be just as good for you as a proper diet: in addition to being one of the most pleasurable activities out there, it also improves your health and your physique.
If you want to have more of it – then you need three things: 1) a partner you’re attracted to; 2) a little quality time with him/her; and 3) a high-fat diet.
Yup – you’ve heard it right: once again, fat is the key.
Why?
Because saturated fats and cholesterol are necessary to produce testosterone and testosterone ramps up your sex drive.

Final Notes
may not offer many new things on the table, but it works great as a compilation for “total human optimization.”
In other words, instead of buying separate books on improving diet, health, exercise, and sex life – you can just buy this one.
It really works as a well-structured anthology of digested versions of many other books.
And that is a compliment."

is a book which everyone who thinks that life is slipping out of his/her control should read. 
Though, essentially, a philosophical book, it is one which deals with practical wisdom primarily, and, thus, abounds with many real-world examples (some of which taken straight from Pigliucci’s life) which demonstrate how the philosophy of Stoicism should be applied in practice.
And to paraphrase Marx – enough with philosophers trying to interpret our lives in various ways; the point is to change them.
Well, that’s this book’s very objective.
About Massimo Pigliucci

“How to Be a Stoic PDF Summary”
Stoicism 101: A Very Basic Introduction
“In every culture we know of, whether it be secular or religious, ethnically diverse or not,” writes Massimo Pigliucci at the beginning of 
,
“the question of how to live is central.”
And the question of how to live is always more than a simple one, encompassing at least three more: “How should we handle life’s challenges and vicissitudes? How should we conduct ourselves in the world and treat others? And the ultimate question: how do we best prepare for the final test of our character, the moment when we die?”
As far as Pigliucci is concerned, the philosophy that gives the best answer to these questions is Stoicism.
However, Stoicism is not all about keeping a stiff upper lip and suppressing your emotions, aka being a modern (or, to be more exact, an old-fashioned) Mr. Spock.
In fact, it is the other way around:
Pigliucci’s book, however, isn’t interested in merely dispelling these myths and unearthing other common misconceptions.
It is, on the contrary, a practical one, a book interested in teaching you how you can live a better life.
But, before that – says Pigliucci – a little road map of the journey, because it is always good to know where you’re going and where you shouldn’t go, and understand the context for all things you’d be experiencing during the journey.
That’s why, in the second chapter of 
,
Pigliucci takes a closer look at the history of Stoicism.
Here it is summarized.
So, the philosophy began around the year 300 BC with a guy named Zeno, who picked up most of his beliefs and understandings of the world from a philosopher named Crates, after surviving a shipwreck.
Now, Zeno taught his students at the Stoa Poikile – or “The Painted Porch” (a public place in the center of the city) – and this is why his philosophy and its followers were subsequently known as Stoicism and Stoics.
For the next century and a half, Stoicism was just one of the many philosophical schools interested in the practical application of philosophy (the other being the Peripatetics, the Cynics, the Epicureans, the Cyrenaics, the Academics, the Skeptics), but then in 155 BC, something very important happened.
Namely, the heads of the Stoa at the time (Diogenes of Babylon), the Academy, and the Peripatetic school were all chosen as ambassadors to represent Athens in political negotiations with the Roman Empire.
In time, Rome did conquer Athens in military manners, but politically and philosophically, this visit changed Rome forever.
The visit itself was enough to start the period of the Middle Stoa which, after Rome became the largest empire ever seen, evolved in the Late Stoa, represented by the four best-known Stoics: Musonius Rufus, Seneca, Epictetus, and 
.
With the advent of Christianity, Stoicism was basically dead for millennia; fortunately, modern authors (such as Pigliucci) have resurrected it from its ashes.
Part I. The Discipline of Desire: What It Is Proper to Want or Not to Want
The three parts of Pigliucci’s book consist of four chapters each.
The first one covers the basics as far as disciplining the desire is concerned: the dichotomy of control (“Chapter 3: Some Things Are in Our Power, Others Are Not”), living according to nature (that’s the title of Chapter 4), choosing virtue over comfort and wealth (“Chapter 5: Playing Ball with Socrates”), and the existence of God (“Chapter 6: God or Atoms?”).
This is the central tenet of the philosophy of Stoicism and is not at all surprising that Ryan Holiday’s 
begins with Epictetus’ formulation of it.
Here’s another one, quoted by Pigliucci:
This is the great rule-of-thumb when it comes to making ethical decisions the Stoic way: just ask yourself what you can control and what you cannot.
For example, you can’t control the weather, and no matter how much you want to play soccer you’re your friends, you can’t make it “unrain.” 
What you can do, however, is switch to another game which includes your friends. So, what’s it gonna be: anger and no soccer or a touch of bargained joy and a game of monopoly?
Yeah, we thought so too.
But this is applicable on many other occasions.
Just take Pigliucci himself.
He wasn’t happy with his body a while ago, so instead of wallowing in the mire, one day, he asked Epictetus what to do, and decided to do what he 
do: eat less and healthier, exercise more regularly, and drop the unhealthy habits.
The result?
Well, he achieved a better physique.
However, he didn’t get exactly the body he wanted to (a slim, muscular one), because, well, genes. 
And 
he accepted. 
After all, he didn’t have any other choice.
Now, let us go even further than the example above – with another one, straight from the life of none other than Socrates.
As you know full well – not in the least because we’ve summarized two relevant books on the subject (Plato’s 
and 
) – Socrates was not only tried for his teachings by the Athenian court but was also judged guilty in the end. 
However, because he was well loved by quite a few guys with good connections – and because his prison guards were not unlike the prison guards of today (aka, 
) – Socrates had an easy opportunity to escape just a day before his death sentence.
However, as we learn from Plato’s 
(remind us to summarize that one as well), Socrates chose not to.
His explanation?
Nothing matters more than integrity – not friends, family, children, or even one’s own life.
In other words, Socrates knew that it was his moral duty to accept the law even when it is patently misused, “because we don’t get to change the rules when they happen not to suit us.”
He spent his whole life telling others that they must adhere to the law no matter what – and he should be the first one not allowed to be exempt from this rule.
Just like Socrates, we’re given with a certain amount of marbles; we can try to multiply them or keep them and use them till they run out. But we cannot change the fact that there are marbles in the game.
Pigliucci realized this himself after hearing that his bank is dealing with some shady businesses; even though, if it is up to him, there should be no banks whatsoever, that’s not something that he can change.
The only thing he 
 do, however, was to switch banks.
Part II. The Discipline of Action: How to Behave in The World
The four chapters in Part II of 
deal with character and virtue (“Chapter 7: It’s All About Character (and Virtue)”), evil and ignorance (“Chapter 8: A Very Crucial Word”), role models (“Chapter 9: The Role of Role Models”) and disability and mental illness (the title of Chapter 10).
As Pigliucci informs us, “the Stoics adopted Socrates’s classification of four aspects of virtue, which they thought of as four tightly interlinked character traits: (practical) wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice.”
The most important among this is, of course, the first one: (practical) wisdom. And there’s a pretty simple reason for this: it is the mechanism which allows you to practice the dichotomy of control, making humans the only species known capable of doing this.
Put simply, 
, because, as many examples show, you can be happy regardless of your conditions.
Though courage can be understood as a physical trait, the Stoics meant a more ethical category, for example, the ability to act well under challenging circumstances (such as, say, 
).
Temperance is what makes it possible for us to “control our desires and actions so that we don’t yield to excesses,” the archenemy of 
 (aka, the ethically good life).
Finally, justice “refers not to an abstract theory of how society should be run, but rather to the practice of treating other human beings with dignity and fairness.”
This is, perhaps, the strangest aspect of Stoic philosophy: most sociologists and educators today say that you 
 have role models because they might hinder your development as a unique human being.
However, having a role model is basically like 
 having a name to fill the blank in the all-important ethical question: “What would ______________ if he were in my position?”
For 
, for example, the guy most suited to fill in the blank was none other than Marcus Cato, known as Cato the Younger.
A stubborn statesman immune to bribes, to Seneca, Cato was an embodiment of the virtuous life.
When he was a military commander, Cato slept and ate alongside his soldiers who, expectedly, loved him because of this. When he was a tax collector for Cyprus, he dutifully collected taxes and didn’t use the opportunity to enrich himself.
When Caesar attempted to seize control, Cato fought him to defend the Republic; and when he lost, he decided to commit suicide rather than be captured.
On top of it, his suicide (piercing his stomach with a dagger) didn’t pan out perfectly, so Cato’s shriek alarmed the servants and the physicians.
“The physician went to him,” informs us Plutarch, “and would have put in his bowels, which were not pierced, and sewed up the wound; but Cato, recovering himself, and understanding the intention, thrust away the physician, plucked out his own bowels, and tearing open the wound, immediately expired.”
Now, that’s gory.
It’s also incredibly demanding, courageous and ethically almost otherworldly.
Of course, most people never have to face situations such as these, but having Cato as a role model helps throughout.
After all, standing up to your boss doesn’t look like something 
 demanding in view of Cato’s suicide, does it?
Part III. The Discipline of Assent: How to React to Situations
Speaking of death and suicide, the final part of Pigliucci’s book begins with an exploration of it (Chapter 11), before analyzing how to deal with anger, anxiety, and loneliness (Chapter 12) and moving on to topics such as love and friendship (Chapter 13) and practical spiritual exercises (the final, Chapter 14).
As you can see from the example of Cato – and Seneca using him as a role model – the ancient Stoics were very concerned with death.
Actually, writes Pigliucci, “’concerned’ is precisely the wrong word. They were aware of death and of the importance that human beings attach to it, but they developed a very unusual and empowering view of it.”
And you can sense a lot of it from this passage taken straight from Epictetus’ 
 (II.6):
In other words, dying is part of life and, no matter what you do (
), you, and all the people you know, will one day die.
Accept that and fill the rest of your life with simple pleasures; because no matter how angry or stressed you are about death – it will happen.
So, why worries?
Unlike us who most of the time distinguish between friends and enemies, the Greek – from Aristotle onward – distinguished between at least three types of friendships: friendship of utility, friendship of pleasure, and friendship of the good.
A friendship of utility is – to quote Pigliucci – “what we nowadays would call an acquaintance based on reciprocal advantage.” Think of your favorite hairdresser as a good example: it’s not like you call him/her once or twice a week, but it’s not like you don’t enjoy visiting him/her either.
A friendship of pleasure is once again based on a reciprocal relationship, but this time it is not utilitarian: the commodity which binds these friendships together is pleasure. The guys you play soccer with serve as a good example: most of them you only call when you arrange a game. And they come – because they enjoy playing soccer just like you do.
Finally, a friendship of the good, “that rare phenomenon when two people enjoy each other for their own sake because they find in each other an affinity of character that does not require externalities like a business exchange or a hobby.”
Now, as far as the Stoics were concerned, the only friendships worth pursuing are the last ones. 
It doesn’t mean that the other two don’t matter (on the contrary, in fact), but they are not about the people as much as they are about the commodities. Go bald or start playing basketball, and they’ll break up.
The real friends, however, remain until the very end. They are not the guys or girls you talk to about celebrities or sex scandals, but the ones you tell your most naïve dreams and worst nightmares.
Do you have someone like that in your life?
Hold onto them.
That’s what Epictetus and 
 advise.
Key Lessons from “How to Be a Stoic”
1.      The Serenity Prayer Is Stoicism 101
2.      Learn How to Play Ball with Socrates
3.      Raging or Not, You’ll Die Either Way: Make the Most of Your Life
The Serenity Prayer Is Stoicism 101
Pigliucci happened upon it for the first time in Vonnegut’s 
, but you probably know it from every second movie or TV show: the Serenity Prayer.
It goes like this: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,/ Courage to change the things I can,/ And wisdom to know the difference.”
In this modern form, the prayer was canonized by the American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, but you can find it among ancient Judaist and Buddhist scholars as well.
The most ancient version, however, is probably found in Epictetus’ 
 (or 
), right at the beginning.
It forms the basis of Stoic philosophy, advising you to worry 
about the things you can change, and let the others be 
 you can’t change them.
Learn How to Play Ball with Socrates
Now Epictetus – though he started out as a slave – was a fairly smart guy. Unsurprisingly, he often mentioned another smart guy in his writings, his role model, Socrates.
Socrates, he wrote at one place, “was like one playing at ball. What then was the ball that he played with? Life, imprisonment, exile, taking poison, being deprived of his wife, leaving his children orphans. These were the things he played with, but none the less he played and tossed the ball with balance.”
“So,” he concluded, “we ought to play the game, so to speak, with all possible care and skill, but treat the ball itself as indifferent.”
Wait… 
Pigliucci has an excellent explanation.
Raging or Not, You’ll Die Either Way: Make the Most of Your Life
“I must die, must I?” wrote Epictetus at the beginning of his 
.
“If at once, then I am dying: if soon, I dine now, as it is time for dinner, and afterward when the time comes, I will die.”
May you always boast of this kind of serenity before death. 
It is, to say the least, admirable. 
But, once you think about it, it is also 
as well.

: 
Who Should Read “The Fortune Cookie Principle”? And Why?
Seth Godin says that “this should be the next book you read. Urgent, leveraged, and useful, it will change your business like nothing else.” And who are we to argue?
Heed to Godin’s advice especially if you are a marketing strategist, an entrepreneur, or a business owner.
The Fortune Cookie Principle Summary
Even a four-year-old entrepreneur with her first lemonade stand knows the one, basic truth about business: 
. 
In other words, just setting out your stall is not enough.
And yet, writes Bernadette Jiwa, that’s exactly what most of us do in business. 
“We take our idea, our product, our innovation,” she writes, “and 
 people to pay attention to it. We try to change what people think (using the facts), so that we can change what they do (buy our products and services).”
However, today, people have way more choices than they actually need, giving them one luxury, our ancestors never had: they can simply 
 the things they don’t care about. 
“Changing how people think and getting them to act isn’t so easy anymore,” concludes Jiwa.
That’s where 
comes in. Using a plethora of well-known examples, the book reveals 
 the key to building a great business is devising a great brand story—and then proceeds to explain 
you can write it yourself by focusing on the 20 most important keywords.
New Marketing: A Recap
According to Brian Solis, only 71 of the companies placed on the original 
list compiled in 1955 remain there today.
The reason?
, the rules of the game of marketing changed in the meantime, and only the ones who really bothered realizing this are still in it.
At the beginning of her book, Jiwa offers a quick recap of what you need to know—aimed at the ones “out of the loop:”
• 
. We’re living in the opt-in age now, i.e., people can ignore everything that comes their way simply by changing channels, scrolling or installing an Adblocker. “In theory,” Jiwa says, “people are easier to reach, but in fact, they are harder to engage.”
• 
. “A double-page spread in the weekend newspaper is not marketing,” reminds Jiwa her readers. “A promoted tweet is not marketing. A billboard at the train station is not marketing.”
• 
. There was a time when it was enough to say, “We invented this; now let’s hire someone to find a way to sell it.” That time is long past. 
• 
. Instead of being just tacked on at the end, marketing is an organic part of what you do, aligned with your mission, objective, and values. 
• 
. Just think of it this way: Kodak filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2012. Even though, for generations of people, saying “Kodak” was practically synonymous with saying “a camera,” just like saying “Google” is today synonymous with Internet searching. Modern marketing is dynamic—and it’s more than marketing.
The Fortune Cookie Principle
Not that long ago, 
 of why some companies work, and others don’t.
Namely, the former don’t sell commodities (
), neither the way these commodities are made (
), but they sell stories (
).
Well, that’s the basis of what Bernadette Jiwa calls “The Fortune Cookie Principle.”
Every idea, she says, every innovation, every product, and service has two elements: the cookie and the fortune.
The cookie, in this analogy, is the commodity, the utility, the tangible product. The cookie is the thing you put in the shop window, and it has a fixed value. The cookie is the 
.
Then, there’s also the fortune, “the magical, intangible part of the product or service, which is where the real value lies in the hearts and minds of the customer.”
“The fortune is the story,” Jiwa explains, “the thing that makes people feel something. The real reason they buy the product in the first place. It’s your purpose, your vision and values manifested. It’s also the customers’ story and worldview reflected back to them. The fortune gives the product an acquired value or a different perceived value.”
In short, the fortune is the 
.
You already know where Jiwa is heading.
People don’t buy fortune cookies because they taste better than other cookies: they buy them because of the delight they offer at the end of the meal.
That’s why, if you want to build a great company, baking a good cookie is merely the beginning: you need to focus most of your energy on something else, something far more important—creating a better fortune. 
The Story Is Your Advantage (Building a Brand vs. Selling a Commodity)
“Great brands are the ones that tell the best stories,” said once Jason Fried, the co-founder of Basecamp, practically summing up the section above. “Sure, good products and service matter, but stories are what connect people with companies.”
Bernadette Jiwa has a better way of making this more comprehensible to her readers: via two very simple mathematical equations:
• PRODUCT – MEANING = COMMODITY
• PRODUCT + MEANING = BRAND
In other words, the difference between a brand and a commodity is quite straightforward: the story. Because, after all, stories are how you attach meaning and significance to anything, and businesses are not an exception.
It is a scary and somewhat painful truth, but it is the truth nevertheless: “the product with the most features and benefits doesn’t always win.”
Jiwa knows that this is the opposite of what you’ve learned at school, but that doesn’t mean that she isn’t right.
Think about this way: the students with the best grades usually don’t get the best jobs and almost certainly don’t have the best lives. (We know quite a few examples, and we’re pretty sure that you know at least a few similar ones as well).
For better or for worse, every single day, people who are simply “good enough” succeed in life. And the main reason why is: well, they are capable of telling a better story.
The conclusion?
It’s not the commodity you sell—its quality, its price, or its distribution—that is your competitive advantage; it is the story: the story is your advantage.
What Is a Brand Story?
“A brand story is more than a narrative,” writes Bernadette Jiwa. 
“The story goes beyond the copy on a website, the text in a brochure, or the presentation used to pitch to investors. Your story isn’t just what you tell people. It’s what they believe about you based on the signals your brand sends. The story is a complete picture made up of facts, feelings, and interpretations, which means that part of your story isn’t even told by you.”
In other words, everything you do—from your staff to the packaging to the way you communicate with your customers—is part of your brand story. Gone are the days when a brand story was just a catchy tagline on a billboard—a brand story today is the foundation of a business, a foolproof strategy for future growth.
One more thing, though: a brand story is also 
 what merely gets you to be top-of-mind; it is what gets you to be close-to-heart.
It is the 
 that a brand generates which have the potential to differentiate one brand from another, for the simple reason that consumers can 
 
 to a limited number of brands.
If you don’t believe Jiwa, just make a quick mental comparison between Microsoft and Apple.
Which one is the top-of-mind brand? And which one is the close-to-heart?
You know the reason.
The Twenty Keys to a Great Brand Story
According to its author, the
“Fortune Cookie Principle” is “the foundation upon which you can differentiate your brand and make emotional connections with the kind of clients and customers you want to serve.”
It is, in more theoretical terms, “a brand-building framework and communication strategy consisting of twenty keys that enable you to begin telling your brand’s story from the inside out.”
And these are the twenty keys:
The truth, in the meaning Jiwa uses it, is not just a “collection of facts, figures, and nutritional values that are printed on your packaging.” It is a “real understanding of the business you’re in.” 
And this, in Jiwa’s words, “often has less to do with the product you are selling or the service you are providing and more to do with the feelings your brand elicits.”
So, ask yourself: what business are you 
in? What do your customers want from you, and 
 do they want to feel? 
Remember: you’re not selling a 32MB music player, but 1,000 songs in a pocket. And you are not selling cars, but excitement (Porsche) or safety (Volvo).
This is the 
: why are you in business? If it is to make money, then chances are you’ll never build a great brand. 
You are in the business because you can do something nobody else can, like satisfying everyone’s curiosity (Google) or delivering razors by mail (Dollar Shave Club).
Share your purpose and make sure that you stay true to it.
What effect will your business have on the future? What happens 
 you exist? How can you support this vision in the day-to-day running of your business? How will the changes your business brings about change how your customers feel and then act?
Your vision is always about change: whether it’s a tiny part of the world, or the world entire, you can’t build a brand if you don’t want to make the future a better place for at least someone (that is not you).
Values are the answer to the question, “What do you believe?” Make a list—there are no right or wrong answers. 
And once you make it, ask yourself this: How are you demonstrating your beliefs to the world and to your customers? Do your values come across in the service you deliver and the tone you use in your content?
If vision is about the future, values are about the present: how is the world better for you being here?
As we noted above, a product or a service without meaning is a commodity. To make it something more, tell the story of how your idea came to be and why it matters, i.e., why does the world 
your product or service.
Use your story to differentiate your product from your competitors.
If you hire just for skills, you’re not hiring well enough: after all, Werner von Braun was one of the greatest scientists in history, but he was a Nazi. If NASA had hired him today, it would have been boycotted by just about everybody.
Who you hire and what he or she stands for is very important. Your people must fit in your story; otherwise, they are not your people.
What are you really selling? How are you least like the competition? Why would customers cross the street to buy from you? How does opening and using your product or experiencing your service make your customers feel?
These are the questions Jiwa wants you to ask yourself to realize the value you deliver. It has little to do with price and a lot to do with convenience, time, shortcuts, etc.
As you know full well, a great name changes the game. 
? Would they have grown into one of the greatest companies in the world without 
?
Probably not.
It’s your turn.
Nowadays, if you’re not original, then probably you’re just a little more than nobody. More than anything, that applies to your content and copy—your words, your voice, your megaphone directed at your audience.
A great way to realize if you’re original is to ask yourself this simple question: “Could you remove the logo from your website or marketing materials and substitute it with a competitor’s logo?”
If the answer is “yes,” then change 
.
Nowadays, everything is designed. So, just like with your content and copy, you need to do something to stand out.
If an image is worth a thousand words, then your design can make people feel emotionally attached to your product even more than your words can.
So, “ask yourself what does your design (colors, logo, packaging) communicate about your brand?” and sync this answer to your story.
As we said above, a brand story is much more than a name and a tagline. In the 21
 century, it’s also much more than design, content and copy, commodities and services… It’s 
 everything you do.
Just think about it this way: would you buy something from a vegan company whose owner and employees are noticed celebrating something at McDonald’s?
Customer experience encompasses everything that happens when people encounter your brand. It’s already outside of your territory—but it doesn’t mean that you can’t do something to guide it.
Ask yourself what kind of experience you want to deliver to your customers and then start thinking about how to deliver it.
If you make your customers feel nice—they will share this feeling with others. They will share 
feelings, in fact, so be careful.
Now, customers use markers to detect what kind of audience you want to attract; price and quality are two of the most immediate markers.
If you want to communicate luxury with your story, then it’s wrong to be cheaper than your competitors (think Jimmy Choo). If, however, you want to communicate affordability, then your 
is to be as cheap as possible.
Of course, the price goes hand in hand with quality: it’s pointless to be more expensive than your competitors if you don’t offer quality for the money, isn’t it?
Let us ask you once again: how are you 
 like the competition? Build your story around this because that’s how you can differentiate from your competitors. 
You want your customers to perceive your product as something unique and to associate it with something grander and more universal.
For example, Vespa is a symbol of freedom—and it sells because of this perception.
We mentioned Dollar Shave Club above and here’s a chance to mention it once again. Their razors are nothing new; their distribution (via subscription and mail) 
.
That’s what you want as well: sending a signal to your customers about your brand through your distribution model.
One mistake you should avoid at all costs is the middleman: our century is the century of networking and direct relationships.
The more personal you get, the more customers you find.
Google wanted to open a branch in Berlin, but Berliners are famously anti-establishment and anti-corporation oriented. Because of this—and because of quite a few protests—Google had to back off.
Don’t make the same mistake when choosing the location for your business: even your locations should fit in with your story.
An upmarket boutique won’t thrive in an area with high unemployment, and it would probably not be a good idea to sell affordability in Silicon Valley.
There are two ways to succeed: either you’ll appeal to the masses, or you’ll appeal to a group of people with a particular worldview.
In the first case, you want to make people feel as if they are part of the crowd; in the second case, you want to make them feel the opposite: as if they are unique.
Whatever you do, however, be consistent: you’ll probably trip if you want to make the leap from ubiquity to scarcity or vice versa.
Of course, there’s nothing that a good story won’t cover—but you better have one already prepared. 
Your brand is defined not only by your story but also by the people buying that story. 
“LEGO fans, the LEGO community. They define what LEGO is all about,” says Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, knowing full well that LEGO is bigger than it is simply because the people who buy it participate in its story.
The greatest of all brand stories are the ones shared by a company’s customers. Think about what you can add to your story to inspire your customers to become a community.
As you probably know from experience, there’s a difference between what people say about you when you’re in the room and what they say about you when you’re not in it.
Well, the same goes about your brand: reputation is built around honesty, and honesty starts with you.
Think about what you would like your customers to say about your product, and then about how you can achieve that.
Key phrase: 
How would you like customers to react to your brand? Five-star reviews, great feedback about service, or recommendations to friends? There are no right or wrong answers, but, once again, the key is loyalty.
If you’re loyal to Starbucks, you’ll get more coffee than you pay for. That is why 25% of Starbucks’ customers buy their coffee with a pre-loaded loyalty card. 
What opportunities do you give to your customers to demonstrate their loyalty to your brand? What do they get in return?
Key Lessons from “The Fortune Cookie Principle”
1.      The Fortune Cookie Principle
2.      Your Advantage Is Not Your Commodity—But Your Story
3.      A Recap of Jiwa’s Twenty Keys to a Great Brand Story
The Fortune Cookie Principle
We all want fortune cookies, don’t we?
Now, ask yourself this: why do we want fortune cookies?
Are they the best cookies? The tastiest ones? The most chocolate ones?
Most people would say, undoubtedly, that it’s neither: simply put, we like fortune cookies not because of the cookie, but because of the fortune.
Bernadette Jiwa says that the same principle should be the foundation of all business. Because people don’t buy the commodity—they buy the story behind it.
Your Advantage Is Not Your Commodity—But Your Story
In two equations, Bernadette Jiwa’s point looks like this: 
• PRODUCT – MEANING = COMMODITY
• PRODUCT + MEANING = BRAND
In other words, you don’t have to be the best when it comes to your product: you just need to be “good enough.” It is the story you attach to your product that gives it significance and meaning and which can make it something more than just commodity, i.e., a brand.
And “brand” is a different way of saying “a successful future-proof company.”
A Recap of Jiwa’s Twenty Keys to a Great Brand Story
Bernadette Jiwa thinks that you need to build your story around these twenty foundations: 
The truth, vision, values, products and services, your people, the value you deliver, name and tagline, content and copy, design, your actions, customer experience, price and quality, perception, distribution, location, ubiquity or scarcity, community, reputation, reaction and reach. 
Some, of course, are more important than the others and, depending on your business, some might be of little importance, but 
.
The keys, however, are not meant to be prescriptive, Jiwa says: they are your starting point. But not ignoring them should eventually help you build emotional connections with your customers—and precisely the ones you’d like to serve.

Have you ever gone on a trip around the Gulf South for no apparent reason?
Do you want to go on one? How about having Joan Didion for a companion?
If the answer to both of the questions above is “yes” then – hop on:
Who Should Read “South and West”? And Why?
If you’ve ever read anything by Joan Didion, you already know that she is – as a 
 review once noted – not only a good novelist but one of USA’s greatest essayists.
Well, this book is a collection of notes which never got to become essays; but the writing still has the same power, sharpness, and beauty.
In addition to being a Joan Didion book, there’s another reason why you should read 
: in retrospect, her observances of the South seem prophetic.
Read more carefully, and you’ll see Trump’s name written over some of these pages – even though they date from the 1970s.
About Joan Didion
 is an American journalist, novelist, and essayist.
Widely admired for her writing style and her capability to portray the disintegration of American morals and the social fragmentation of the USA, Didion is often considered one of the most prominent voices in the New Journalism literary movement.
Winner of the National Book Award for Nonfiction for her autobiography 
, Didion is the author of six novels and as many screenplays, a play, and about a dozen nonfiction works.
“South and West PDF Summary”
 as “a scrapbook of background notes, thoughts and early drafts by one of the most extraordinary writers of our time,” Joan Didion’s 
, for the most part, looks like a book that never should have been written.
And, in a way, it never was: comprising two sections – the substantial “Notes on the South” and the pretty brief, even less structured, and no more than trivial “California Notes” – the book is nothing more but a string of beginnings no middle and an end, sort of would-be essays, if you please.
And they all date back to the 1970s, the second part being peculiarly and almost anachronistically topical, covering (mostly) the abduction of Patty Hearst by the Symbionese Liberation Army.
Then why should these notes be published at all?
“No doubt Didion has now decided to publish 
,” wrote Michiko Kakutani in her review for 
,
because they similarly shed light on the current political moment. At a remove of more than four decades, she maps the divisions splintering America today, and uncannily anticipates some of the dynamics that led to the election of Donald J. Trump and caught so many political and media insiders unawares.”
In other words, the ever-intuitive brilliant mind of perhaps the greatest modern American essayist felt, back in the 1970s, that the American story most of the other people believed in is not the whole story.
And feared that, one day, the untold parts of it would feel like a twist.
 is proof that they shouldn’t.
California and the South
At first glance, even the arrangement of the book seems strange: why should Didion’s “Notes on the South” from her 1970 notebooks be paired with her “California Notes” from six years later? 
Aren’t the two incompatible on so many levels?
Well, in a way, that is exactly the reason why Didion grouped these two selections.
“I had a theory that if I could understand the South,” she explained her decision to the 
 in 2006, “I would understand something about California because a lot of the California settlers came from the Border South.” 
“It is a counterintuitive theory,” writes Nathaniel Rich in the “Foreword” to 
, “for the South and the West represent the poles of the American experience – the South drowning in its past, the West looking ahead to distant frontiers in a spirit of earnest, eternal optimism.”
“The future always looks good in the golden land,” wrote Didion in 
, “because no one remembers the past.” 
“In the South, no one can forget it,” adds Rich.
Almost impossible to be summarized – after all, it is a string of purposefully unstructured notes – 
chronicles traces and window-glances of two Didion’s trips.
The first one is a tour Didion and her husband John took of the Gulf South for a month in the summer of 1970, making notes and recording conversations for a future piece – one that would never be completed. 
The second part records some notes of a visit to San Francisco in 1976, paid by the 
magazine so that Joan Didion can provide them with an account of the trial of Patty Hearst.
, this one too gives birth to something better.
Notes on the South
“I could never precisely name what impelled me to spend time in the South during the summer of 1970,” writes Joan Didion in one of the first notes from the first part of 
. 
“There was no reportorial imperative to any of the places I went at the time I went: nothing ‘happened’ anywhere I was, no celebrated murders, trials, integration orders, confrontations, not even any celebrated acts of God.”
But what she writes next strikes with prophetical fervor:
“And so,” Didion goes on, “instead of talking about it I flew south one day in the summer of 1970, rented a car, and drove for a month or so around Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama, saw no spokesmen, covered no events, did nothing at all but try to find out, as usual, what was making the picture in my mind.”
The notes – some longer, some brief – chronicle Didion’s travels from New Orleans and Biloxi, Mississippi, to Meridian, Mississippi, and Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and, finally, into Faulkner’s hometown, Oxford.
Didion’s first note opens with an anthologically beautiful paragraph:
“In New Orleans,” Didion writes in another note, “they have mastered the art of the motionless.”
One afternoon on St. Charles Avenue, Joan witnesses the death of a woman, falling forward over the wheel of her car.
What strikes Didion most is the fact that not many people consider this death a special event. 
“Dead,” says an old woman upon seeing the body and, afterward, when asked by a waitress whose fault it was, says that it’s nobody’s.
And then, suddenly, the two start talking about the weather, noting how incredibly hot it is.
“The death had seemed serious but casual,” notes Didion, “as if it had taken place in a pre-Columbian city where death was expected and did not in the long run count for much.”
In a brilliant study of the American South nowadays – aptly titled 
 – Arlie Russell Hochschild reveals why most of 
 are radically Republican and why they don’t intend to change this.
Half a century before, Joan Didion got a glimpse of this and penned it down in a few notes which kind of tell the same story from the other side: just as to a Louisianan, a Californian may seem a natural enemy who understands nothing about reality, to a Californian, being in New Orleans, may seem as if he/she’s visiting another country.
And here’s a simple note which demonstrates this.
Since Didion falls and hurts a rib in New Orleans, she decides to see a doctor in Meridian. She goes to the Rush Foundation Hospital (where all doctors are members of the Rush family), and, while waiting, starts seeing the world through 
 eyes:
And it gets even worse than that.
When asked if she is traveling alone, Joan Didion says she’s traveling with her husband, but she’s not wearing her wedding ring.
A long pause follows.
“The past is never dead – it’s not even past,” wrote the South’s greatest writer, William Faulkner, in his 1951 novel 
.
Anyone who has ever visited the red-state counties on the American South knows exactly what that means.
But very few would ever be able to put it into words better than Didion:
“The time warp: the Civil War was yesterday, but 1960 is spoken of as if it were about three hundred years ago.”
Bear in mind that Didion is writing about the 1970s, the years after the Civil Rights Movement, and the years when it seems America is finally becoming America for all Americans.
However, Didion doesn’t feel this; on the contrary: it feels as if the South is buried deep into the past, with most of the people she overhears speaking nostalgically about things such as cheap labor and racism.
And why is that?
One word: isolation.
“The isolation of these people from the currents of American life in 1970 was startling and bewildering to behold,” writes Didion. “All their information was fifth-hand and mythicized in the handing down. Does it matter where Taos is, after all, if Taos is not in Mississippi?”
Has something changed 50 years later?
Of course not!
“Readers today will recognize,” writes Nathaniel Rich in the Foreword, “with some dismay and even horror, how much is familiar in these long-lost American portraits. Didion saw her era more clearly than anyone else, which is another way of saying that she was able to see the future.”
In other words, Didion’s intuition wasn’t far off: the South wasn’t the past but the future.
And the election of Trump and the era of fake news – unfortunately – proved her more than right.
California Notes
Move along – not much to see here.
“California Notes”
(which you can read in their entirety 
) started with Joan Didion telling Jann Wenner of 
 that she’s interested in covering the Patty Hearst trial.
No need to go into the trial in detail, because the notes barely even mention it.
And you already know the main facts: in 1974, William Randolph Heart’s (aka Citizen Kane’s) granddaughter Patty was kidnapped by the far-left Symbionese Liberation Army and, in the most famous Stockholm syndrome twist in history, two months later, decided to change her name to Tania and start robbing with the SLA; she was caught a year and a half later.
Joan Didion went to San Francisco to follow the trial, but this pushed her into examining her thoughts about California.
They did evolve into something in the end – but not an article on Patty Hearst: though published in 2003, Didion’s book 
 is the final result of her 1976 trip to San Francisco.
And these notes, for the most part, seem as if the few that didn’t make it there – most of them being about Didion reading Gertrude Atherton than anything else.
Key Lessons from “South and West”
1.      Isolation Breeds Fifth-Hand News and Alternate Facts
2.      The South and the West | The Past and the Future
3.      We May Be Through with the Past, But the Past Ain’t Through with Us
Isolation Breeds Fifth-Hand News and Alternate Facts
Though Joan Didion visited the South half a century ago, she did notice something the consequences of which we notice only today: “all their information was fifth-hand, and mythicized in the handing down.”
In other words, Didion observed (that what we now consider) fake news is not a new phenomenon, but a way of life for America’s Southerners, going all the way back to the tall tales of the 19
 century.
After all, someone who has no present has no option but to feed his/her imagination on myths.
The South and the West | The Past and the Future
We chose to separate the two in the title with a vertical bar mainly because we didn’t know how. 
Even though at first glance it may seem that the South (New Orleans) represents the past and the West (California) the future of the United States, Didion had some doubts about this already in the 1970s.
In fact, as she hints in the very first notes, she had some strange feeling that it might be the other way around.
Back then, probably nobody would have believed her.
And then Trump got elected – and now she’s thought of as a prophet.
We May Be Through with the Past, But the Past Ain’t Through with Us
That’s a quote taken directly from Paul Thomas Anderson’s 
We don’t really know the exact origin of it – believe us, we’ve tried finding it – but, in a way, it’s a variation (and an update) on William Faulkner’s famous “the past is never dead; it’s not even past.”
We won’t delve more deeply into these quotes, but we would say that they seem like the best lesson one should take away from Joan Didion’s 1970 notes on the South.
Take that to mean whatever you want it to mean.

Our Critical Review
Dubbed “one of the best books of the year” by both the NPR and the

 is an exceptional book, not the least because it doesn’t even try to be one, being just a string of unstructured and barely connected notes from two trips of the 1970s.
Didion’s notes, however – as Nathaniel Rich notes – “surpass in elegance and clarity the finished prose of most other writers” and “are a fascinating record of [the] time.”
Even more, they are an unsettling look into our present and, perhaps, even our future."

Who Should Read “The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty”? And Why?
If you consider yourself a good and honest person, then let Dan Ariely and his exceptional book, 
, burst your bubble: you are not, have never been, nor will ever be one.
If you want to learn 
 and you are a psychology student, then this book is a good place to start – but be sure to check out Dan Ariely’s other books as well (we’ve summarized all of them just for you: 
).
But please read this one 
 if you are a student of economics, because, well, you are taught wrong about practically everything.
The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty Summary
What the Enron Scandal Says About Your Deceitfulness
Well, you all know the basic story by now, but it’s worth repeating yet again because we’re about to examine it in a wholly different manner.
Enron Corporation – voted “America’s Most Innovative Company” for six consecutive years – was an American energy company based in Houston, Texas, with claimed revenues of over $100 billion and a 30,000 staff in 2000.
And then, by the end of the following year, Enron had to file for bankruptcy.
What happened in the meantime?
Well, in October 2001, it was publicized that through a series of pretty creative accounting tricks (accounting loopholes and special purpose entities, mostly), coupled with poor financial reporting (and, to some extent, disinterest for a proper one from the now-defunct firm Arthur Andersen), Enron had managed to hide billions of dollars in debt from failed projects and deals from its investors.
The main culprits?
, the “three sinister C-level architects”: Kenneth Lay (the Chairman), Jeffrey Skilling (the CEO), and Andrew Fastow (the CFO).
The problem?
Well, 
.
And that’s exactly the thought that crossed the mind of Dan Ariely – the author of 
 – after a discussion with a close friend of his, a one-time consultant for Enron.
He, in the words of Ariely, “hadn’t seen anything sinister going on… Even more surprising, he also told me that once the information was out, he could not believe that he failed to see the signs all along.”
“I started wondering if the problem of dishonesty goes deeper than just a few bad apples,” writes Ariely. “I also wondered whether my friends and I would have behaved similarly if we had been the ones consulting for Enron.”
You already sense the answer, don’t you?
Calling All Art Enthusiasts
OK, but that’s Enron!
The larger and more complex a company is, the more difficult to 
 what’s going on and, let’s face it, more tempting to 
 something dishonest.
After all, if Enron has revenues of $100 billion, then would anyone notice $50 missing?
OK, then, another example.
And this one involves the gift shops of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.
All you need to know for now is that these gift shops were run much like lemonade stands, meaning there were no cash registers, but merely cash boxes; and they did quite well, earning the Center about $400,000 on a yearly basis.
However, each year, more than a fourth of that disappeared.
The manager tried to find the culprit and, after suspecting a young employee for a while, he organized a sting operation with the help from a detective; soon after, the young man was caught with marked bills in his pocket.
Problem solved, right?
Well, far from it: money and merchandise still went missing, even after the man was caught; in a way, catching him barely made any observable difference as to the amount of stolen cash.
The manager saw no way out but to set up an inventory system with price lists and sales records.
Surprise, surprise: the thievery stopped.
Apparently, there wasn’t just one bad apple: 
 was stealing.
Oh, we forgot to tell you who everybody is!
The sales force at the gift shops were “elderly, well-meaning, art-loving volunteers,” “mostly retirees who loved theater and music.”
The moral?
In the words of the manager: “We are going to take things from each other if we have a chance… many people need controls around them for them to do the right thing.”
Big Brother Is Watching
In a way, both Enron and the gift shops boil down to a simple problem: whether we’re capable of resisting stealing something when nobody is watching.
And this is a problem as old as time, going back all the way to Plato’s 
.
In its first chapter, Plato’s brother Glaucon asks Socrates whether a man can be virtuous if he knows for a fact that his crimes would be undetectable.
To illustrate his point, he tells the story of the Gyges ring, found by one of King Gyges’ ancestors, a mere shepherd. 
When properly adjusted at the finger, this ring was so powerful that it granted invisibility to the one wearing it.
Of course, Gyges used it to infiltrate the king’s court, seduce the queen and eventually kill the king and crown himself as the next one.
(Tolkien much, by the way?)
Now, Socrates doesn’t really answer Glaucon’s question; he says, in many, many more words, that a man can be virtuous only if the state is, aka if he knows that the state is watching him/her.
And, you know what?
(Plug your ears, civil libertarians)
He was right!
“To me,” writes Ariely, “Plato’s myth offers a nice illustration of the notion that group settings can inhibit our propensity to cheat. When we work within a team, other team members can act informally as monitors, and, knowing that we are being watched, we may be less inclined to act dishonorably.”
Don’t believe us?
There are experiments, boy!
Apparently, just putting an 
 of eyes above an empty cash box asking for donations makes people donate much more than in its absence (or, if say, the image is of flowers).
Why?
Well, let’s see why.
The SMORC and Everything That’s Wrong with It
If you know anything about Dan Ariely, then you already know that he’s a behavioral economist who thinks (like 
) that rational economics is based on a serious study of human nature as much as the flat earth theory is based on a study of the Earth’s circumference.
And that’s not an exaggeration!
Just think of the SMORC, aka the Simple Model of Rational Crime.
Its origin is pretty mundane.
Gary Becker, a Nobel-Prize-winning economist, once was running late for a meeting and couldn’t find a legal parking spot. So, he opted to park illegally.
Why?
Because he decided that the cost of missing the meeting was greater than the cost of being caught, fined, and possibly towed.
In Becker’s mind, that must be exactly what’s happening in the mind of most criminals.
The problem is – we now know for a fact that it 
work that way.
Take this simple experiment.
Two groups are tasked with solving 20 math assignments and told that they would be given $5 for each correct solution.
There’s a catch, of course: the first group’s worksheets are reviewed, and the second one’s claims are taken for granted.
As expected, the unreviewed tests were fascinatingly better: people claimed, on average, that they had solved 6 assignments when the other’s group actual average was 4.
Now, the stakes were upped: what if they are given $10 or $15?
According to SMORC, they should have claimed to have performed better.
But that didn’t happen.
In fact, nothing changed.
The most interesting part?
Nothing changes even if the unreviewed group is given the opportunity to shred their tests, thus eliminating the chance of being caught.
Two Types of Motivation
The reason why the SMORC is wrong is pretty simple: the motivation to lie is merely one aspect of our character.
“Honesty and dishonesty,” clarifies Ariely, “are based on a mixture of two very different types of motivation. On the one hand, we want to benefit from cheating (this is the rational economic motivation), while on the other, we want to be able to view ourselves as wonderful human beings (this is the psychological motivation).”
In other words, we want to both have our cake and eat it too.
Rationally, this is impossible.
However, as Dan Ariely has demonstrated to us 
 and 
, we are not rational beings.
And our comprise is surprisingly simple.
“Basically,” concludes Ariely, “as long as we cheat just a little bit, we can have the cake and eat (some of) it too. We can reap some of the benefits of dishonesty while maintaining a positive image of ourselves.”
This is what Ariely terms the “fudge factor theory.”
In essence, it’s about balancing things right.
The psychological motivation – our innate wish to see ourselves as wonderful human beings – is just as powerful as the rational economic drive: to earn more with less.
And this is exactly why certain forces such as the two described above (“the amount of money we stand to gain and the probability of being caught”) influence our decisions much less than one might think they do.
At the same time, other forces influence us 
than we might expect.
There’s a whole list of the latter: “moral reminders, distance from money, conflicts of interest, depletion, counterfeits, reminders of our fabricated achievements, creativity, witnessing others’ dishonest acts, caring about others on our team, and so on.”
Let’s see how the first two of them work in practice.
May the Ten Commandments Be Engraved in You
Let’s add another twist to the experiment with the two groups assigned with solving a math test.
The first one – if you read carefully – was informed that their test would be reviewed; the second one that there’s no mathematician in the house, so the guys shelling out the money ($5 for a correct solution) would have to take their word for it.
The twist is this: the second group was now divided into two groups, one of which was asked to reread the Ten Commandments before the test; the other one was instructed to recall ten random books studied in high school.
The last group cheated as much as they did previously; however, the group which recalled the Ten Commandments before solving the test didn’t; at all.
Apparently, it doesn’t even matter if you are religious or not. What matters is the 
 that there’s something more to cheating than your own benefit.
Here’s another example for the atheists who can’t empathize with the above one.
A business consultant (actually, a comedian in disguise) comes to your school and gives you a lesson on how to cheat and get away with it.
Do you:
a) consider the advice helpful;
b) have an uneasy feeling that a business consultant is telling you this; or
c) both of the above.
For most people, it’s 
, aka a clear example of seeing both motivations at work.
“These advices are good for you,” says the rational voice in your head. “Wait a second,” a second one, psychologically-motivated voice joins in, “isn’t it 
 to do this?”
One Step Removed from the Money
Another experiment shows precisely why the more distant you are from the money, the less tempted you are to do something bad.
The experiment goes something like this.
In an MIT dorm, half of the communal refrigerators are stacked with six packs of Coca-Cola; the other half with paper plates containing six $1 bills.
Of course, all of the students know that neither the Cokes nor the dollar bills belong to them; also: they all know (or have a vague idea) that the 
 worth of the two is pretty much the same (you can buy a Coke for $1).
What do you think happened after three days?
Yup: all of the Cokes were gone, but not one of the dollar bills was touched. Even though nothing stopped the students from taking a dollar bill, walking over to the nearby vending machine and getting a Coke and some change; for some reason, no one did.
And that reason is psychological: “the fudge factor” increases the greater the psychological distance between the dishonest act and its consequences.
In plainer words, it is easier for you to rationalize that you are a good person if you need just one step of rationalizations to do that (taking Coke); however, if it takes you more than one (taking the money 
 buying Coke), then it’s more difficult to digest that psychologically.
It’s basically the difference between murdering someone with malice and murdering someone in a state of affectation. There are two different punishments for that
because
in the first case, you had the time to change your mind.
“From all the research I have done over the years,” concludes Ariely, “the idea that worries me the most is that the more cashless our society becomes, the more our moral compass slips.”
Is There a Solution?
Ariely’s book abounds with examples and experiments such as the few described above, each more interesting than the other.
However, for the purposes of this summary, we decided to limit ourselves to the few which most directly say what should one do if he/she wants to limit dishonesty.
In a way, it’s nothing that we don’t know intuitively already but is everything most rational economists and politicians forget when setting up our systems (hence, the crises).
Here’s a secular (and elegant) example which speaks volumes about 
.
A woman in South America noticed that her maid had been stealing a little bit of meat from the freezer every few days. 
She was rich enough to not care about this too much, but nobody likes to be cheated (especially if that leaves you with not enough meat to make dinner sometimes) so she decided to do something about.
And no – she didn’t organize a private detective or fired the maid.
She just put a lock on the freezer and told the maid that she suspected someone is stealing from the freezer; then, she gave her a key to the lock and a small financial promotion, adding that the two of them are the only ones who now have the key and must be watchful.
Of course this worked!
Because by putting a lock on the freezer the woman both put a check on the maid’s temptations 
 created a psychological distance.
Now, stealing the meat would mean making two steps (unlocking the freezer and then taking some meat), and that’s not easy to rationalize.
Finally, by singling out the maid as the most trustful person, the woman put a moral burden on her, the one the Ten Commandments put on the math-testers.
And that made all the difference.
Key Lessons from “The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty”
1.      Honesty and Dishonesty are Based on a Mixture of Two Contrasting Motivations 
2.      You Constantly Rationalize Your Dishonesty to Make Yourself Look Good (to You)
3.      The More Distant the Dishonest Act, the More Difficult to Cheat 
Honesty and Dishonesty are Based on a Mixture of Two Contrasting Motivations 
According to most economists, people cheat only after making a rational cost/benefit analysis. In other words, if there’s a low chance of being caught and a high benefit from a dishonest act, then it’s only human to cheat.
However, behavioral economists have discovered that it doesn’t work that way. Apparently, we do do this cost/benefit analysis, but only in combination with a psychological 
 of the actions. In plainer words, we only cheat 
 and 
 we can rationalize it.
You Constantly Rationalize Your Dishonesty to Make Yourself Look Good (to You)
Mixed, this motivation works like this.
If you are given a test with twenty questions and promised to be given $5 for every correct answer, but told that there’s nobody to review your answers – then you’ll probably cheat. 
And you’ll cheat no more even if they gave you $50 dollars for a correct answer and offered you an opportunity to shred the test afterward, you’ll cheat.
Why?
Because cheating too much can put a strain on your brain; and you want your brain to process your cheating in a certain “I did it, but not as much as I could” manner.
Because this both allows you to cheat and makes you a good person.
The More Distant the Dishonest Act, the More Difficult to Cheat
The more obstacles are there between you and the dishonest act, the bigger the strain on your brain.
That’s why you’ll think twice before stealing someone’s money but only once before stealing someone’s Coca Cola.

Who Should Read “Through the Language Glass”? And Why?
Have you ever watched 
? 
Or, at least, those wonderful and wonderfully funny 
? 
If the answer is “no” to both questions, be aware that you need no more than a few minutes to watch the latter. And you 
 – because then you’ll know much better what this book is about: the power of language to influence worldviews.
A recommended read for anyone even vaguely interested in language and/or our capability to learn and use one: in one sentence, there are few better introductions to linguistic relativity and related topics than Guy Deutscher’s 
.
Through the Language Glass Summary
Part I: The Language Mirror
If you know a thing or two about British history, then the name of William Ewart Gladstone would certainly mean something to you.
After all, the guy was UK’s Prime Minister for 12 years in the 19
 century!
But that’s not why Deutscher spends a large part of the first chapter of 
talking about him.
You see, while out of office, Gladstone devoted “his legendary energies to the realm of the mind, and in particular to his burning intellectual passion” Homer.
And ten years before he became Prime Minister for the first time, Gladstone published a book now read almost exclusively by classicists and linguists: 
.
Why linguists?
Well, because in it, there’s a chapter whose content is even more interesting than its title: “Homer’s Perception and Use of Color.”
Gladstone’s analysis of Homer’s epics – the 
 and the 
, of course – “revealed that there is something awry about Homer’s descriptions of color.”
What?
Well, this:
#1. Homer often uses the same word to denote colors which, according to us, are essentially different; for example, both the sea and the oxen are described as having the appearance of wine.
#2. Homer often describes the same object with incompatible color terms: iron can be violet, gray, and horse-colored.
#3. Homer’s epics are remarkably colorless: e.g., he not once uses the color “blue” even when describing the sky and the sea; 
#4. On the other hand, he uses the colors “black” and “white” almost constantly: they appear 170 and 100 times in the epics; for comparison, the next more prominent color is red: 13 times;
#5. All in all, Homer’s color vocabulary is very small.
Why?
No other explanation than this: the Greeks didn’t see colors the way we do.
Even if you knew Gladstone, there’s a good chance you’ve probably never heard of Lazarus Geiger, a German Jewish philosopher and philologist.
And that’s too bad, because, according to Brent Berlin and Paul Key, he was the guy “who first detected universal sequence in the acquisition of basic color terms.”
Basically, what he did is he started out where Gladstone left off, asking himself whether the Greeks using so few words for colors were an exception or a rule as far as ancient civilizations were concerned.
It turned out that it isn’t only Homer, but also the Bible and the Indian Vedas that treat color strangely – at least in relation to modern standards.
For one, neither the Vedas nor the Old Testament – just like all Homer – 
describe the sky as being blue.
In September 1867, in his hometown of Frankfurt-at-Mein, Geiger opened his lecture in which he shared his findings with two thought-provoking questions:
“Has human sensation, has perception by the senses, a history? Did everything in the human sense organs thousands of years ago function exactly as it does now, or can we perhaps show that at some remote period these organs must have been partly incapable of their present performance?”
Now, though initially dismissive of Gladstone and Geiger, many people – especially after Lamarck and Darwin – during the late 19
 century, started interpreting these questions as rhetorical.
Simply put, the eyes of the ancients weren’t as developed as our eyes today: they saw 
colors just like, say, dogs do.
There’s only one problem with this.
How can we know what they 
 saw?
For example, the Ancient Mycenaeans adored the lapis lazuli. Why would they if they hadn’t been able to 
 the color blue?
Could it be that they simply didn’t have a word for it?
“To most people who have heard of him,” writes Deutscher, “W. H. R. Rivers is the compassionate psychiatrist who treated Siegfried Sassoon during World War I.”
To linguists, however, he is one of the guys who proved the evolutionists wrong and the culturalists right – when it comes to color perception, that is.
It all happened just at the turn of the centuries.
In 1898, W. H. R. Rivers set off on a journey to the northern tip of the Great Barrier Reef and had a word or two with the so-called Torres Straits Islanders.
What he discovered (mostly) boils down to this: the Islanders were pretty capable of discerning colors, but their language lacked words to pin down this perceptual capability.
For example, when asked to choose similarly colored wool pieces from a range of differently colored wool, the Islanders were just as good as the Europeans in choosing the right pieces (this is, by the way, called the Holmgren wool test).
However, when asked to describe these colors, they used the same words: for example, the word for the color red (
), derived from the word for blood (
) was also used for pink and brown.
“Rivers’ meticulous experiments,” writes Deutscher, “thus demonstrated beyond any possible doubt that people can see the differences between all imaginable shades of colors and yet have no standard names in their language even for basic colors such as green or blue.” 
However, this wasn’t the only conclusion Rivers arrived at.
Interestingly enough, the other questioned his previous findings – the ones explained above.
You see, just like Homer and Moses, for some reason, the Torres Straits Islanders did use the word “black” to describe the perfectly blue sky.
Rivers couldn’t understand this at all.
And he basically just gave up there.
“One cannot,” he wrote, “wholly ignore the fact that intelligent natives would regard it as perfectly natural to apply the same name to the brilliant blue of the sky and sea which they give to the deepest black.”
It may seem strange at first, true, but it is not really difficult to explain this, says Deutscher.
Simply put, the ancient civilizations saw these two colors as two different shades of the 
 color.
Here’s an interesting thought experiment in counterfactual history for you to understand this.
Just imagine the Russian anthropologist Yuri Magnovievitch Gladonov going on an expedition to the remote British Isles off the northern coast of Europe in the late 19
 century.
Wouldn’t he be dumbfounded to find out that the British Islanders think that both the 
 and 
colors are just two shades of a single color?
They insist on calling both of them “blue,” even though they differ between them (and this is a scientific fact) as much as the colors green and blue!
The conclusion?
The color spectrum is a continuum; different cultures divide it differently; and for some, the chunks of this spectrum are bigger, so they see many colors that others see as different like different shades of the same color.
That’s it.
Or is it?
In addition to questioning the concept of a unified human color vision – across space and time – Geiger discovered something else as well.
Namely, that almost all cultures developed color words in much the same order.
First, they were aware of the difference between dark and bright, so the first two color words that appear anywhere are black and white; then followed a sensitivity to red, then yellow, then green, and finally violet and blue.
Now, if this evolution is so universal, then at least some of it must be connected to our human nature.
And in 1969, Brent Berlin and Paul Kay – in their book 
 – demonstrated that this is 
 true.
In other words, neither the culturalists nor the evolutionists were right – because neither of them was wrong to begin with.
And the reason for this is quite simple.
“The more decisive nature has been in staking out its boundaries,” explains Deutscher, “the less leeway there is for culture… On the other hand, when nature has shown even the slightest dithering or fuzziness in marking its boundaries, different cultures have far more sway over the division of concepts than anyone exposed only to the conventions of one society would imagine.”
And unlike preexisting categories (such as dogs and birds and roses), colors are not strictly divided. 
It is, in other words, pretty normal to expect from all languages to have different words for dogs and birds and roses, but it is not normal to expect from all of them to distinguish between blue and green and yellow.
However, it is not strange that red is, universally, the first color to be named (that is, after black and white): it is the color of survival, the color of sex and blood.
It is, more or less, common knowledge that the more primitive a society is, the more primitive its language is.
Just think of all those movies when a primitive man comes to life in a modern age or arrives in a 
.
His linguistic capabilities are childish, to say the least: “me sleep here” is the best he can utter for the most part of the movie.
However, “attempts to connect particular types of linguistic morphology with certain correlated stages of cultural development are vain,” wrote Edward Sapir in 
in 1921, adding, quite casually, that “rightly understood, such correlations are rubbish.”
Simply put, all languages are, in one way or another, complex; it’s just that complexity works in a different. 
Just think of it this way: the English language spoken by both the cops and the gangs in 
 is equally complex but has developed in two parallel processes.
“When it comes to linguistic form,” concluded Sapir, “Plato walks with the Macedonian swineherd, Confucius with the head-hunting savage of Assam.”
And it’s even more interesting than this.
A guy named Revere Perkins, in 1992, tried to test out the commonsense theory that more complex societies develop more complex languages.
What he found out will probably surprise you: it is – prepare for it – 
In other words, the more complex a society is, the simpler the word structure.
Why?
Because complex societies are more global and more connected to the world, so they often need to explain their own contexts to strangers; and strangers want simpler explanations.
Don’t believe us?
Then, please do tell us, which language sounds to you simpler: Shakespearean English or Global English?
 Yeah, we think so too.
Part II: The Language Lens
The abovementioned Edward Sapir is probably one of the most famous linguists nowadays; unfortunately, it is mostly through a pseudoscientific theory – further developed by one of his students, Benjamin Whorf – now known (wrongly) as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.
In essence, the theory states that language categories either 
 or 
and 
cognitive categories. 
Simply put, it means that you’d grown up a different person if, say, you grew up in Germany and acquired the German language as your first one.
In a way, it makes sense: it’s difficult to expect from a person whose language hasn’t developed simple words for complex numbers to be a good mathematician; even more relatable: do you honestly believe that we’d be as good at math as are if we still used Roman numbers to multiply and divide?
However, even though popularized by many movies (
being the most famous among them) and pseudoscientific Internet articles, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is, as much as it has been tested, decidedly wrong.
Even Sapir knew this, suggesting that “it would be naïve to imagine that any analysis of experience is dependent on pattern expressed in language.”
And even though 
 and Chomsky explicitly blame Whorf for unscientifically advocating linguistic determinism, it may be true that even he didn’t believe it to the extent he is blamed for.
Anyway, one thing isn’t naïve at all.
To phrase it the way Russian-American linguist Roman Jakobson did: “Languages differ essentially in what they 
 convey and not in what they 
 convey.”
“The crucial differences between languages, in other words,” sums up Deutscher, “are not in what each language allows its speakers to express – for, in theory, any language could express anything – but in what information each language obliges it speakers to express.”
And the examples, please?
Well, here’s the first one.
It concerns spatial reality, and it deals primarily with the way the Aboriginal Guugu Yimithirr tribe of Far North Queensland see space and spatial relations.
To understand this better, first you need to understand the difference between relative egocentric and pure cardinal directions.
Relative egocentric directions are the ones you use on a regular basis: left, right, forward, backward, up, and down. They are called egocentric because they depend on your position (
 means “I” in Latin); and that is the exact same reason why they are called relative: no absolute direction corresponds to any of these relative directions.
Pure cardinal directions, however, are absolute: they are the directions of north, east, south, and west. If you turn around what was to your left is suddenly located on your right, but the pure cardinal direction didn’t change.
And why are the Guugu Yimithirr people so strange?
Well, because they use pure geographic directions instead of egocentric ones even when they’re talking casually between them.
For example, “if you are reading a book facing north, and a Guugu Yimithirr speaker wants to tell you to skip ahead, he will say, ‘go further east,’ because the pages are flipped from east to west.” However, “if you are looking at it facing south, the Guugu Yimithirr will, of course, say, ‘go further west.’”
You wouldn’t be able to make this distinction without a compass, which means that the worldview of the Guugu Yimithirr people 
 
 determined by their language.
They sense the cardinal directions because their language obliges them to.
“Gender,” writes Deutscher, “provides our second example of how the mother tongue influences thought.”
Once again, it is because in some languages you are obliged to specify the gender of all nouns, even though, most of them, don’t have a natural gender by definition.
This results in some identifiably strange incidents.
For example, the Spanish word for “bridge” is 
 and the German one is 
; you don’t need to know a lot Spanish or German to understand that, as far as the Spanish are concerned, bridges are males and, as far as the Germans are asked, they are females.
Nothing strange so far: it’s a convention, and, since bridges have no natural gender, words just developed that way.
However, when Toshi Konishi asked both German and Spanish speakers to describe a bridge, he realized an interesting pattern: Germans 
 chose primarily feminine properties, and Spanish speakers chose masculine ones.
Why?
Because their brains are hardwired to think of bridges in the manner their language tells them to; to Spanish people a bridge can be “big, dangerous, long, strong, sturdy, towering,” but to Germans it can only be “beautiful, elegant, fragile, peaceful, pretty, and slender.”
And it gets even weirder.
As Lena Boroditsky and Lauren Schmidt discovered, if you ask a Spanish person to remember that a bridge is called Claudia, he/she is more likely to forget this than if you say that the bridge’s name is Claudio; and the same holds true for Germans – only it is the other way around with them.
The conclusion?
Well, we started this section with it: just reread the first sentence.
As the title of this section suggests, we’re going back to every linguist’s favorite field: the vocabulary of colors.
“In returning to the subject of color,” writes Deutsch here, “this final chapter tries to discharge an old debt, by turning on its head the nineteenth-century question about the relation between language and perception.”
What? What does “turning on its head” mean? Didn’t we reach a conclusion already?
Well, not exactly.
Gladstone and Geiger believed that “differences in the vocabulary of color resulted from preexisting differences in color perception. But could it be that cause and effect have been reversed here? Is it possible that linguistic differences can be the cause of differences in perception?”
In other words, is it possible that we see the colors in the way our language dictates us to see them?
The answer is “yes.”
The experiment is simple: English speakers are asked to choose the “odd one out” from a series of three colored chips across the blue-green spectrum. 
The trick?
Two of them are green, and the third one is greenish blue; however, the two greens are distanced between them on the spectrum much more than the greenish blue in relation to any of them.
Of course, English people exaggerated the distance and always chose the greenish blue.
The same experiment was then conducted in Mexico, with speakers of an Indian language called Tarahumara.
Why?
Well, as you would expect, because in Tarahumara green and blue are shades of one color
Now, the Tarahumara speakers did not choose the greenish blue and didn’t exaggerate the distance between chips on different sides of the green-blue border. 
The official conclusion?
“The difference between the responses of English and Tarahumara speakers,” writes Deutsch, “demonstrated an influence of language on the perception of color.”

Your Language Determines How Many Colors You See
You’ve probably already heard that women can see more colors than men; 
, but it has more to do with our biology than anything else.
However, regardless of whether they are men or women, all people see colors differently; and some of it is due to language.
For example, if you are English, you see two shades of blue where the Russians see two different colors. And experiments have shown that you are more capable of discerning between two very distant shades of green than between green and greenish blue – which is not the for Tarahumara Indians who don’t have a different word for these colors.
The Gender of the Nouns in Your Language Influences How You Think About Their Real-World Counterparts
As you should know full well by now, there’s miles and miles difference between sex and gender, since the latter is socially constructed and the former is a biological spectrum.
Well, as far as language is concerned, gender is so dependent on conventions that it not only exists in a grammatical form, but it also differs from language to language.
For example, bridges are females for Germans and males for Spanish.
The strange part?
Spanish people often describe them with masculine properties (long, towering, sturdy, hard), but Germans with feminine (beautiful, elegant, fragile, pretty).
The Guugu Yimithirr People 
 Know Left from Right
The Guugu Yimithirr language is unusual in one peculiar manner: it doesn’t have words for left, right, up, and down (egocentric directions), but instead uses the cardinal points (north, east, west, and south).
That means, as far as the Guugu Yimithirr people are concerned, you are not reading from left to right, but from east to west – or west to east, depending on whether your nose is pointing to south or north.

Who Should Read “Amusing Ourselves to Death”? And Why?
is one of the classics in the fields of cultural criticism and media studies so everyone interested in them should have already read it.
However, Neil Postman’s 1984 vision about the world of today seems so true that we think everybody should read this book.
Not reading it would be basically synonymous with ignoring a traffic post sign saying “Stop. Dead End. No outlet.” 
We’re serious about this.
Amusing Ourselves to Death Summary
When 1984 came, and 
 of a world run by totalitarian governments didn’t pan out the way everybody feared it would, “American sang softly in praise of themselves.” And they sang even louder six years later 
.
Neil Postman, however, was a bit worried. Because, in his mind, humanity was losing the battle and – what’s worse – it was losing it on a largely ignored field.
And that’s the message Postman wanted to relay to the participants of a panel on Orwell at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1984.
His main point?
Orwell may have been wrong about the future, and that is one fight we won; however, Aldous Huxley was dead-on right, and, unfortunately, that is the war we’ll eventually lose.
George Orwell vs. Aldous Huxley
But aren’t Orwell and Huxley saying the same thing?
Absolutely not, says Neil Postman.
“Contrary to common belief even among the educated,” he writes, “Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley’s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity, and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.”
And then Postman explains the differences between 
and of 
First and foremost, he says, Orwell – 
 – feared censorship and people banning books; Huxley, on the other hand, feared that there would be no reason to ban books in the future because nobody would be reading them. 
Point: Huxley.
Secondly, Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information; Huxley feared the ones who would give us so much “that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism.” 
So, 2:0.
In plainer terms, Orwell feared that truth would be concealed from us; Huxley feared that the truth “would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance.” 
3:0.
Thirdly, Orwell feared that humans would become slaves; Huxley, on the other hand, feared that humans might just become 
 free. In fact, Huxley explicitly remarked in 
 that
the civil libertarians and rationalists always oppose tyranny but fail “to take into account man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions.”
4:0.
Fourthly, Orwell feared a world where we will be controlled by inflicting pain; Huxley a world where we will be controlled by inflicting pleasure. 
5:0.
“In short,” Postman concludes, “Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.” 
Game, set, and match.
Whatever Happens in Vegas… Happens in the USA As Well
“At different times in our history,” writes Neil Postman at the beginning of 
, “different cities have been the focal point of a radiating American spirit.”
In the late 18
 century, for example, Boston “was the center of a political radicalism that ignited a shot heard round the world;” and, in a way, 
, even Virginians became Bostonians. And this was all embodied in a recognizable statue: the Minuteman.
Soon after, America, symbolically, became New York: “the melting-pot” for the “wretched refuse” of the world. We don’t need to tell you the figurative embodiment of New York’s spirit: the Statue of Liberty.
And then, in the early 20
 century, Chicago, “the city of big shoulders and heavy winds, came to symbolize the industrial energy and dynamism of America.” The statue that should personify this period: a hog butcher, an appropriate “reminder of the time when America was railroads, cattle, steel mills and entrepreneurial adventures.”
The city that represents the American spirit – call it the global spirit, if you will – today?
Las Vegas, Nevada, “a city entirely devoted to the idea of entertainment, and as such proclaims the spirit of a culture in which all public discourse increasingly takes the form of entertainment.”
Its symbol is “a thirty-foot-high cardboard picture of a slot machine and a chorus girl” and the very fact that this is possible spells doom – not in the Orwellian boom, but in the Eliotian whimper kind of way.
“Our politics, religion, news, athletics, education and commerce,” writes Postman ominously, “have been transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business, largely without protest or even much popular notice. The result is that we are a people on the verge of amusing ourselves to death.”
The (D)evolution of the Culture
To understand how we got there, you need to understand the transformation of our culture: from word-based to image-based one. 
It may sound theoretical at the moment, but by the end of this summary, you’ll probably understand what it 
 means much better than you’ll even want to.
First, lets’ go back to the years when the USA was established.
Back in 1776, Thomas Paine published 
; the book, as you know full well from your high-school classes, sold about 100,000 copies in just three months and a half million by the end of the decade.
And you know how many people lived in the United States according to its first (1790) census?
A little less than 4 million!
In other words, a sixth of the American population bought and, based on the discussions at the time, 
the book.
Even according to conservative estimates, that would mean that a book has to sell about 40-50,000,000 copies today to be considered as successful as Paine’s!
And, let’s face it, Paine’s book wasn’t a cookbook or an epic fantasy novel.
In the 19
 century, things took off from where one would expect them to: the American (and the global) culture became word-centered to the point that many intellectuals casually 
 in a style that, to today’s readers, would seem pretty much indistinguishable from writing.
Let’s go back to the middle of the century, for example.
On October 16, 1854, two 
 presidential candidates – Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas – gave speeches which lasted for hours and hours.
More precisely, first Douglas delivered a 3-hour address to the people of Peoria, Illinois, to which Lincoln, by agreement, was supposed to respond.
And you know what Lincoln did?
He proposed that the audience go home and have a dinner and then return because he would probably need at least as much time as Douglas (in fact, he took an hour more).
Postman’s amazement doesn’t stop at the speakers.
“What kind of audience was this?” he asks “Who were these people who could so cheerfully accommodate themselves to seven hours of oratory?”
It’s even more amazing to think that Douglas and Lincoln weren’t presidential candidates in 1854; in fact, they weren’t even candidates for the Senate back then. 
And yet, many people spent most of their days listening to their speeches.
Nowadays, even a 20-minute dissertation defense seems boring and long.
“We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas,
but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate,” wrote Henry David Thoreau in 
a few months before Lincoln and Douglas had one of their first many-hours-long debates, doubting the benefits (or even the need) of the telegraphic cable.
 “We are eager to tunnel under the Atlantic and bring the old world some weeks nearer to the new,” he went on, “but perchance the first news that will leak through into the broad, flapping American ear will be that Princess Adelaide has the whooping cough.”
Most of Thoreau’s 
 may sound a bit outdated, but he was right (and far-seeing) about one thing.
Namely, the fact that we are so well-connected may mean that we are nominally better informed, but more data doesn’t mean that we’re getting closer to the truth.
In fact, it means the opposite: 
, but also between relevant and non-relevant information.
In retrospect, the Telegraph struck the first blow to the Word (and in an Orwellian Newspeak manner), but Photography knocked it out cold.
Suddenly, advertisers realized that an image is worth a thousand words, and that, when taken out of context, it may have the value of a million more.
And that’s how show-business was born.
When 
was first published, the President of the United States was Ronald Reagan, a former Hollywood movie actor. 
In the meantime – and this is scary, we’re telling you this is 
– we’ve managed to make a step 
: now, the actors are in the Senate, and our president is a former reality TV star!
What’s next? A dog for a president? 
We’re not overreacting here!
Because the problem – spotted by Neil Postman and growing worse by the decade – is a pretty serious one.
Namely, more than smart people, we like pop-stars; and more than serious intellectual endeavors, we want entertainment.
That’s why the people who get to the high places have become, more often than not, pop-stars who entertain.
It’s their faces we are interested in – not their words.
Word-Centered vs. Image-Centered Culture
To understand the evolution outlined above better, you need to understand that before the advent of photography and telegraphy, “the printed word had a monopoly on both attention and intellect, there being no other means, besides the oral tradition, to have access to public knowledge.”
Consequently, public figures – even the most famous ones – were almost exclusively known through their written words – not by their looks and not even by their oratory.
“It is quite likely that most of the first fifteen presidents of the United States,” writes Neil Postman thought-provokingly, “would not have been recognized had they passed the average citizen in the street. This would have been the case as well of the great lawyers, ministers, and scientists of that era.”
In other words, to 
 about these great men meant, by definition, to think about what they had written, “to judge them by their public positions, their arguments, their knowledge as codified in the printed word.”
And you already sense where this is going.
Quite probably, the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, or Billy Graham – or to be more contemporary: Trump, Obama, Bush – is an image, a picture of their face, and most likely one seen on the television screen.
Want one better?
.
You think you know him, right – because you’ve seen quite a few photographs of his face; however, think about his writings and “almost nothing will come to mind,” because, well, let’s face it: you haven’t read anything.
That’s the basic difference between 
in a word-centered and an image-centered culture. 
The latter is hardly thinking, isn’t it?
The main culprit?
TV, of course.
The Twilight of Intellectualism: Television
Of course you don’t agree with the title!
But that’s precisely the problem.
Because, in a very real manner, the title is all but a fact: you can’t consider yourself an intellectual if you spend four or five hours watching TV.
And that’s how many hours the average American spends in front of the television!
Since you’re already resistant to insights such as this, let Neil Postman explain to you a thing or two about your TV-watching habits.
Even though he speaks primarily about “the philosophy of the education which television offers,” we don’t think that we’re wrong if we say, paraphrasing Neil Postman, that all TV programs adhere to three commandments:
In other words: no prior knowledge is necessary. “There must not be even a hint that learning is hierarchical, that it is an edifice constructed on a foundation,” notes Postman. “The learner must be allowed to enter at any point without prejudice.”
The more complicated a TV program is, the fewer viewers it has. Do we really need to spell it out for you? That means that all television is simple by definition. “It is assumed that any information, story or idea can be made immediately accessible, since the contentment, not the growth, of the learner is paramount.”
This one may sound a bit more complicated, but it is still a pretty simple commandment, boiling down to the simplest idea of all: television is all about story-telling, and not one bit about “arguments, hypotheses, discussions, reasons, refutations or any of the traditional instruments of reasoned discourse turn television into radio or, worse, third-rate printed matter.”
All in all, whether you’re watching a commercial or Carl Sagan’s 
, 
 or 
– they are all primarily interested in framing their lessons in simple images and stories that can be gobbled down immediately and without prior knowledge.
To sum up, TV is for us what the gladiator fights were for Rome.
And we know for a fact that Roman generals used gladiator fights as a smokescreen, as a way to do what they want while the public is entertained to death – for some guys, quite literally.
What does that say about our TV-watching habits?
Well, almost nothing good.
First and foremost, that we’ve managed to transform reality into an entertainment show – and that we are not even aware of this.
Don’t believe us?
Think of the news, first. Why do they have beautiful hosts and presenters? Why do they have music? Why do they relate most of their news in a story-like fashion? Finally, why are they interspersed with commercials? Does it really make any sense for you to hear about the mass shootings at a school and 
see a McDonalds commercial?
And what about the public debates? Think of it this way: in a world of alternate facts (created by TV), does it matter who tells the truth? Of course not. And that’s why the victor is always the best showman. That’s why the Jordan Peterson vs. Slavoj Zizek debate was such an event: the two are primarily showmen.
The absurd go to such heights that there are nowadays religious TV channels. Really? What’s so sacred about the very medium which created this world which habitually glorifies show-biz scandals, violence, and sex?
Nothing.
Well, except for the money that is.
Is there a way out?
Well, according to Neil Postman, there is; but it’s counter-intuitive.
Namely – bad TV.
“Television,” concludes Postman, “serves us most usefully when presenting junk-entertainment; it serves us most ill when it co-opts serious modes of discourse—news, politics, science, education, commerce, religion—and turns them into entertainment packages. We would all be better off if television got worse, not better.”
Want examples?
Postman has them:
“The A-Team” and “Cheers,” he says, are no threat to our public health. However, TV programs such as “60 Minutes,” “Eye-Witness News” and “Sesame Street” are.
You know their modern correlatives.
Stop watching them.
And, more importantly, don’t ever allow your kids to watch them.
Key Lessons from “Amusing Ourselves to Death”

3.      The Three Commandments of (Educational) TV
Orwell Was, Fortunately, Wrong; Huxley, Unfortunately, Wasn’t
We all know Orwell’s dystopian vision of the future from 
; anyone who is old enough to remember the days of communism knows full well how much we feared it might become a reality. Fortunately, both Orwell and our parents were wrong.
Unfortunately, says Neil Postman, another dystopian vision of the future has, in the meantime, turned into reality: the one prophesized by Huxley in 
.
The main difference between the two?
Orwell believed that we would be controlled through inflictions of pain (the boot stomping on a human face), but Huxley feared that we would one day be controlled through inflictions of pleasure.
According to Postman, though we’ve escaped the former, we’re living in the latter, TV being our modern-day soma.
We Live in an Image-Centered World – and That’s Very Bad
The world of the 19
 century was a word-centered one: people knew other people (even presidential candidates and scientists) merely through their words. 
Most of the first fifteen US presidents would have probably been able to walk the street unnoticed by the majority; but even if they had written something anonymously, they would have probably been found out.
Nowadays, it’s the other way around: we know how Einstein looks like, even though we haven’t read anything by him (and barely a few Wikipedia sentences 
him).
The problem?
The image-centered world destroys our capability to 
 properly; we are bombarded by images, and we are incapable of making proper sense of the world.
The Three Commandments of (Educational) TV
The main culprit for the pervasiveness of this image-centered world philosophy is, of course, TV. 
And TV, according to Postman, adheres as strictly to three commandments as fundamental Judaists adhere to Moses commandants.
And these are:
#1. Thou shalt have no prerequisites;

is a well-written and well-argued book, both immensely powerful and (unfortunately) amazingly far-sighted in its predictions.
“As a fervent evangelist of the age of Hollywood,” wrote Camille Paglia recently and apologetically, proving this, “I publicly opposed Neil Postman’s dark picture of our media-saturated future. But time has proved Postman right. He accurately foresaw that the young would inherit a frantically all-consuming media culture of glitz, gossip, and greed.”
Highly, highly recommended.

Who Should Read “The Wisdom of Life”? And Why?
If you are interested in the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer but you are not that keen on spending many a tiresome hour reading 
,
then
is as a good alternative as any.
One of the six essays from the first
part of his 1851 book, 
, 
was originally intended to work as an appendix to Schopenhauer’s philosophy.
True, this may mean that you won’t get to the bottom of it – for better: it is dark and gloomy there – or that you won’t even understand some parts of it the way you should be, but the essay is, nevertheless, approachable, comprehensible and, for the most part of it, 
by itself. 
Add to this its subject – human happiness and how to attain it – and you already know that this is one curious kind of a self-help book you’re not allowed to pass on.
The Wisdom of Life Summary
“In these pages, I shall speak of 
 in the common meaning of the term, as the art, namely, of ordering our lives so as to obtain the greatest possible amount of pleasure and success.”
Thus begins Arthur Schopenhauer his essay on happiness which he then says is merely another addition to the study of happiness, or as the Greeks called it Eudaimonology (
, you guess, is the Greek word for happiness).
To those who know at least something about Schopenhauer, the sentence above may seem a bit strange. After all, the man is basically synonymous with pessimism in the world of philosophy! 
And you kinda get that feeling right from the start when Schopenhauer defines the happy existence as one “which, looked at from a purely objective point of view, or, rather, after cool and mature reflection — for the question necessarily involves subjective considerations — would be decidedly preferable to non-existence.”
If you want a bit clearer formulation, this means that the happy existence, for Schopenhauer is one we cling to “for its own sake, and not merely from the fear of death,” one we don’t like to come to an end.
You understood that right: in short, to Schopenhauer, happiness is a temporary state which doesn’t make you want to kill yourself.
Great start, Arthur!
And it gets even weirder!
In the very second paragraph from the “Introduction,” Schopenhauer makes clear that the very idea that man can be happy is ridiculous: “this hypothesis,” he writes, “is based upon a fundamental mistake.”
However, he goes on, he is willing to make a compromise and “take the common standpoint of every day, and embrace the error which is at the bottom of it.”
Well, the scene is yours, Arthur: please do!
Chapter I: Division of the Subject
Of course, the question of happiness is neither a new one nor one rarely explored by
. 
However, as far as Schopenhauer is concerned, none of them really got to the bottom of it. On the contrary, in fact, they made numerous incorrect guesses.
Aristotle, for example, in 
, divides the blessings into three categories: “those which come to us from without, those of the soul, and those of the body.”
According to Schopenhauer, he was only right about the number. In other words, there 
 three distinct classes of “fundamental differences in human lot,” but they are much different:
: this refers to a man’s personality, in the widest sense of the word; meaning, it includes a man’s health, beauty, strength, moral character, temperament, intelligence, and education; 
: this encompasses “property and possessions of every kind,” aka material wealth; and
: “by which is to be understood, as everybody knows, what a man is in the eyes of his fellowmen, or, more strictly, the light in which they regard him. This is shown by their opinion of him; and their opinion is in its turn manifested by the honor in which he is held, and by his rank and reputation.”
Of course, there’s a big difference between the degree with which each of these three contributes to one’s overall happiness, with #1 (i.e., man’s nature) kind of governing the other two (#2 and #3).
Time to explore them one by one and see why this is so.
Chapter II: Personality or What a Man Is
Already in Chapter I, Schopenhauer notes that “the world in which a man lives shapes itself chiefly by the way in which he looks at it, and so it proves different to different men.” 
A man of genius, in other words, may see happiness in all sorts of banal things, while an ordinary individual can see nothing of this sort even in majestic things.
To explain this better, he uses Goethe and Byron’s poems, which, he says, are obviously founded upon actual facts.
Now, most people, upon reading them or finding out about all of the interesting things described in the verses, start envying the poets and thinking things like “Oh, why doesn’t something like this happen to me for once!”
However, Schopenhauer says, “it is only a foolish person who would envy the poet because so many delightful things happened to him, instead of envying that mighty power of phantasy which was capable of turning a fairly common experience into something so great and beautiful.”
In layman’s terms, it’s not that Goethe or Byron found better romantic partners than you; it’s just that they were smart enough to transform their pretty normal love life into something grander. Objectively, their love wasn’t that much different from yours; but they were smart enough to 
 see it that way.
“The life of the fool,” says the Bible (Ecclesiasticus 22:11), “is worse than death.” Schopenhauer goes a step further: “a man is sociable just in the degree in which he is intellectually poor and generally vulgar.”
Of course, just a sentence later he makes an extremely racist remark concerning “the most sociable of all people… the negroes” – so, we are really starting to wonder how many friends did Schopenhauer have, i.e., how smart he actually was.
Racism aside, Schopenhauer has a point: even if you are the richest person in the world (#2), admired by just about anyone on this planet (#3), you’d still probably feel a gaping hole inside if you are a fool, because, as Seneca noted once, “folly is its own burden.”
To understand better why “what a man is” 
 takes up a large portion of his ability to feel happiness, it’s probably smart to think about another aspect of our “personalities,” i.e., our general health.
“Health outweighs all other blessings,” writes Schopenhauer, noting that “a healthy beggar is happier than an ailing king.”
It’s kind of difficult to argue with this because, let’s face it, you can’t even enjoy your favorite TV show if you’re sick in bed with temperature. And even if you had all the money in the world at that moment, the only thing you’d ask for is a cure.
“A healthy person has a thousand wishes,” says an old (probably Indian) proverb, “but a sick person only one – to get well.”
Chapter III: Property, or What a Man Has
“I don’t care too much for money,” sang the Beatles famously in 1964, “money can’t buy me love.” 
But that was only a year after they covered Barrett Strong’s “Money” and announced to the world that “money don’t get everything it’s true/ what it don’t get, I can’t use: now give me money, that’s what I want.”
So, which of the two is true according to Schopenhauer?
Well, in a way, both of them – because (as Epicurus first demonstrated) there are different things that money 
 buy and different 
 they satisfy:
: those that, when not satisfied, produce pain, such as food and clothing;
: these are all the things that gratify the senses; since they gratify them, they 
 natural; however, the absence of them, doesn’t cause any pain in the case of many people; and
: these are the luxuries.
Schopenhauer notes that #1 are the most discernible and the most easily satisfiable needs; #2 are a bit more difficult to categorize and even more difficult to satisfy. #3 are both the least comprehensible and are almost impossible to satisfy: they “never come to an end.”
Of course, the needs vary from person to person.
For example, if you are born wealthy, you’d probably adapt to a certain lifestyle which you wouldn’t want to lose, deeming a necessity something others would consider a luxury. 
On the upside, if you are lucky enough to have been born rich, you’d probably develop a more independent mind, and you’d probably acquire a certain set of talents which would allow you to extract happiness from things a beggar rarely would (such as poetry).
Chapter IV: Position, or A Man’s Place in the Estimation of Others
The fourth chapter of Schopenhauer’s 
 is, by far, the longest one and is divided into five sections, each one dealing with a different aspect of “a man’s place in the estimation of others.”
“By a peculiar weakness of human nature,” notes Schopenhauer, “people generally think too much about the opinion which others form of them, although the slightest reflection will show that this opinion, whatever it may be, is not in itself essential to happiness.”
To illustrate “his perverse and exuberant respect for other people’s opinion,” Schopenhauer uses two examples, both from the gallows and both dated back to 1846.
In the first case, a man named Thomas Wix was executed for murdering his master. “On reaching the scaffold,” says a contemporary report, “the miserable wretch mounted the drop without the slightest assistance, and when he got to the center, he bowed to the spectators twice, a proceeding which called forth a tremendous cheer from the degraded crowd beneath.”
Why would a man care about generating a cheer from a crowd a mere second before his inevitable death – is beyond Schopenhauer.
Even stranger: a guy named Lecompte, executed in Frankfurt for an attempt on the king’s life, was annoyed on the day of execution that he was not allowed to shave and appear in decent attire before the crowd.
Go figure!
Schopenhauer notes that this hunger for other people’s approval is the reason for numerous life anxieties and that it is the source of vanity, one of the biblical obstacles to attaining happiness.
The other side of the vanity coin: pride.
Vanity, says Schopenhauer, is the desire to arrive at appreciation indirectly, 
; pride, on the other hand, is “the direct appreciation of oneself.”
Pride, in other words, “is an established conviction of one’s own paramount worth in some particular respect; while vanity is the desire of rousing such a conviction in others.”
Now, “the cheapest sort of pride,” in Schopenhauer’s opinion, is national pride.
Why?
Well, because – explains Schopenhauer – “if a man is proud of his own nation, it argues that he has no qualities of his own of which he can be proud; otherwise he would not have recourse to those which he shares with so many millions of his fellowmen.”
And he goes even a step further: only people who see the follies of their nations and don’t really like them can be considered intelligent ones.
Take that, nationalists!
Rank has “purely conventional value” and, in Schopenhauer’s opinion, can be dismissed in a few words.
And those few words are these: rank “is a sham; its method is to exact an artificial respect, and, as a matter of fact, the whole thing is a mere farce.”
Schopenhauer wrote at a time when it mattered a lot to be a prince or a count or a Sir, and a century and a half later, we see that he was right in the above 
.
There are fewer and fewer people today who think that someone is worthier than them merely because he has obtained some kind of a state title; consequently, there are fewer and fewer people really dreaming about them.
Which is a great thing!
Schopenhauer admits that talking about honor is much more difficult than talking about rank, but, ultimately, he dismisses it as well as because mostly it is a “primitive and innate characteristic of human nature,” the other side of 
.
There are two types of honor, he argues: objective (in the eyes of others) and subjective (in your own eyes). The latter one doesn’t matter as much as the former one since one’s opinion of oneself doesn’t count if it isn’t reaffirmed by others.
And others can affirm it in four different ways:
. This is the basic type of honor, “the widest sphere of all;” it is what prevents us from using “any unjust or unlawful means of getting what we want,” aka “the condition of all peaceable intercourse between man and man,” aka the thing which allows for societies to exist.
. This is the honor you get (or at least you 
a century or two ago) when you’re serving other people in the public sphere; yup, Schopenhauer is talking about teachers, doctors, lawyers, and soldiers;
. You’ve met the racist Schopenhauer, now it’s time you meet the sexist Arthur: a man gets honor from serving the household by bringing in the money, a woman gets honor from (wait for it…) being 
 (if girl) and 
 (if woman). A woman’s honor is much more important, says Schopenhauer, because “women depend upon men in all the relations of life; men upon women, it might be said, in one only.” That’s just fantastic!
. This is the only one which depends on another person’s opinion – and, thus, it is the most primitive one. You know, the one which made people organize duels and kill each other over nothing.
Fame is honor’s twin, and in the sense Castor and Pollux were twins in Greek mythology: while one is mortal, the other is not. 
Of course, Schopenhauer is talking about true fame, the one which is undying and lasts more than a day.
“Fame is something which must be won,” he notes, “honor, only something which must 
 be lost.”
It’s difficult to attain fame: it both takes a lot of effort and, for a large part, it doesn’t depend on you whether you’ll ever get it. 
This last part is why you shouldn’t worry about it too much.
Fame, in the wrong and outdated opinion of Schopenhauer, is but a reflection of your own great personality – i.e., what you are (Chapter II).
In other words, if you strive for greatness (i.e., achieving a great personality), then you might just become famous (even if merely after death), and you’ll certainly be a bit happier than the other people.
However, if you strive to become famous, not only you’ll never become a great person, you’ll probably never be happy as well.
That makes a bit more sense theoretically – but the 21
 century called, Arthur, and it has given you an F on your essay on this subject.
Key Lessons from “The Wisdom of Life”
1.      If You Can’t Find Any Happiness in Solitude – Then You Are, by Definition, Stupid
2.      If You Need Money or Fame to be Happy – Then You Are, by Definition, Stupid
3.      If You Are a Nationalist – Then You Are, by Definition, Stupid
If You Can’t Find Any Happiness in Solitude – Then You Are, by Definition, Stupid
“A high degree of intellect tends to make a man unsocial,” says Schopenhauer, probably trying to find some comfort in the fact that he didn’t have many true friends.
The logic goes like this: the more social you are, the more burden you find in your solitude; and the more burden you find living with yourself, the less interesting things 
 one can find inside your head.
Smart people don’t really need company – they are their own truest and most engaging and most interesting company.
.
If You Need Money or Fame to be Happy – Then You Are, by Definition, Stupid
There are three kinds of needs in life, and only one of these are natural and necessary: those which, when left unsatisfied, cause pain. Of course, we’re talking about food and clothing and stuff here.
The problem is not the second category – natural, but not necessary (those that give pleasure) – but the third one: both natural and unnecessary (aka luxuries). Because these ones are 
satisfied.
In other words, if you are feeling unhappy because you are not famous like Beyoncé or because you don’t have a yacht, you can be absolutely sure that you’ll 
be happy.
If You Are a Nationalist – Then You Are, by Definition, Stupid 
National pride, in the opinion of Schopenhauer, is “the cheapest sort of pride,” because if you are proud of your own nation, then you have no qualities of your own that you can be proud of.
In other words, if you have achieved anything – absolutely 
– in your life, then it makes much more sense to be proud in that than in your nation, something you share with so many millions of people and something you’ve achieved by, well, being born.
Let us make this clearer for you: Schopenhauer says that if you take pride in your nation, then you are not merely stupid, but an entirely unaccomplished imbecile.

Final Notes
is certainly not a major work by Schopenhauer, and nor is it his best-known minor work (which is, arguably, 
).
But even so – perhaps because of its approachableness – it is still an influential work and one which has made at least a few lives better and more bearable.
“With his truths, Schopenhauer gave me a spiritual world and an awareness of happiness,” said once noted Soviet composer, Sergei Prokofiev – echoing the views of many.
Echoing not our views, though, because, for the most part, we believe that 
is an outdated manual for happiness, which is not only racist and sexist but also bases some of its findings on these beliefs; the others seem based on Schopenhauer’s own, personal opinions – and not on objective facts.
But, then again, almost all philosophy is. And

: 
Who Should Read “The Sunflower”? And Why?
covers, yet again, one of the darkest periods of human history – the Holocaust – juxtaposing it against the backdrop of one of our most humane traits – forgiveness.
If you wonder if the two are incompatible – 
 you and 
you forgive a Nazi – then 
is the book you should read; as its subtitle suggests, it explores the possibilities and limits of forgiveness, and it does that through more than 50 different pairs of eyes.
After finishing the book, you’ll inevitably lend Wiesenthal (if merely in the quiet repose of your thoughts) another; we dare you not to.
The Sunflower Summary
If you were a Holocaust survivor and were asked by a Nazi soldier on his deathbed for forgiveness, would you have forgotten the way you had been treated, the fate of your close ones, and the smoke above the gas chambers?
Well, for Holocaust survivor and famous Nazi hunter, Simon Wiesenthal, this was not merely a thought experiment, but an actual real-life experience. 
After recounting it in entirety in the first part of the book, he poses this question to no less than 53 people of varied background; unsurprisingly, their answers differ.
But in order to understand why – first you need to hear the story.
Book One: The Sunflower
opens in the Janowska concentration camp, where Simon Wiesenthal spent three years of his life – between the end of 1941 and September 1944 – working as a forced laborer. At the very beginning, he introduces us to his “closest companions”: 
 and 
.
Josek is a sensitive and deeply religious guy, a Jew whose “faith could be hurt by the environment of the camp and by the jeers or insinuations of others, but it could never be shaken.” Unsurprisingly, Simon jokingly calls him “Rabbi.”
Unlike him, Arthur has lost his faith in God, and his attitude to life is ironic. Consequently, Arthur is often “irritated by Josek’s placidity and sometimes he even mocked him or was angry with him.”
Simon is somewhere in the middle: to Arthur’s “God has abandoned us” and Josek’s “God is with us,” Simon prefers the bitterly funny comment by an old woman: “God is on leave.” “Let me sleep,” Simon replies upon hearing this from Arthur. “Tell me when He gets back.”
Needless to say, the conditions in the camp are more suited for beasts than for humans. And it is not just the forced labor – it is also the scarcity of food and the cold-hearted and sadistic treatment at the hands of the SS officers.
You know the drill: you work until you can, and when you can’t, you’re shot.
At the height of World War II – and the Holocaust – Simon is transferred from the Janowska concentration camp to a makeshift hospital set up in the very same Technical School where Simon had previously studied architecture.
As Simon travels to his new job, he notices a military cemetery enclosed by a low barbed wire fence. On each grave behind the fence, there is a sunflower, as straight as a soldier on parade.
“I stared spellbound,” recalls Wiesenthal:
“Suddenly I envied the dead soldiers,” he adds. “Each had a sunflower to connect him with the living world, and butterflies to visit his grave. For me, there would be no sunflower. I would be buried in a mass grave, where corpses would be piled on top of me. No sunflower would ever bring light into my darkness, and no butterflies would dance above my dreadful tomb.”
Haunted by these thoughts, Wiesenthal arrives at the makeshift hospital. 
And just before he is about to start cleaning medical waste there, a nurse asks him if he is a Jew. After he replies in the affirmative, she carries him to the bedside of a terminally wounded Nazi soldier by the name of 
.
The soldier, surprisingly, asks Wiesenthal for forgiveness.
“I must tell you something dreadful… Something inhuman,” Karl says. “It happened a year ago… a year since the crime I committed. I have to talk to someone about it, perhaps that will help. I must tell you of this horrible deed – tell you because… you are a Jew.”
And Karl proceeds to tell his story.
We learn that he had been born in Stuttgart twenty-one years before his conversation with Simon. His father had been a convicted Social Democrat, and his mother – a Catholic. 
That’s why, neither of them was happy when Karl joined the Hitler Youth, where, by his own admission, his days were full, since he had found both friends and comrades.
Soon after the beginning of the war, Karl made the next, almost natural, step in his career: he started volunteering in the SS. 
And then came the crime.
One day, about three hundred Jews were forced into a house. The house was then set on fire. Karl was one of the SS-officers tasked with shooting at those who would try to escape.
“Behind the windows of the second floor,” he goes on, “I saw a man with a small child in his arms. His clothes were alight. By his side stood a woman, doubtless the mother of the child. With his free hand, the man covered the child’s eyes… then he jumped into the street. Seconds later the mother followed. Then from the other windows fell burning bodies… We shot… Oh God!”
Karl remained haunted by the sight.
And one day, while fighting in Crimea, this image came back to him: climbing out of the trenches near Taganrog, the memory of the burning family seized him, and he suddenly lost all will to fight. 
And then a shell exploded by his side.
“I lie here waiting for death,” Karl says after recounting his experiences. “The pains in my body are terrible, but worse still is my conscience. It never ceases to remind me of the burning house and the family that jumped from the window.”
“I cannot die,” he goes on, “without coming clean. This must be my confession… I know that what I have told you is terrible. In the long nights while I have been waiting for death, time and time again I have longed to talk about it to a Jew and beg forgiveness from him.”
“I know that what I am asking is almost too much for you, but without your answer, I cannot die in peace.”
While Karl is telling his story, Simon, though disgusted and at times all but determined to leave, holds Karl’s hand and shoos a fly away from his rotting body.
And now, after he is finished, Simon is so taken aback that he doesn’t know what to say. 
So, he doesn’t say anything.
“I stood up and looked in his direction,” writes Wiesenthal, at his folded hands. Between them, there seemed to rest a sunflower. At last, I made up my mind and without a word I left the room.”
The next day, he returns to the hospital only to find out from the nurse that Karl died in the night.
Surprisingly, he left him all of his possessions, in addition to his mother’s address. Simon refuses to take anything telling the nurse to send the bundle at the address, to Karl’s mother.
After rejoining his friends at the camp, Simon retells them the story above. All of them are quite happy with the outcome, and even Josek is pretty glad that Simon decided not to forgive Karl – we can’t forgive sins on behalf of other people, he says to him.
During the next two years, both Josek and Arthur die. 
So, one night, Simon, still haunted by his experiences with Karl, recounts this same story to a recent inmate, a young Catholic Pole named Bolek.
“It is true that you can only forgive a wrong that has been done to yourself,” Bolek says to Simon. “Yet on the other hand: whom had the SS man to turn to? None of those he had wronged were still alive.”
In other words, in Bolek’s opinion, Simon should have forgiven Karl, as difficult as it seemed to him at the time.
“Here was a dying man repenting for his sins,” concludes Bolek, “and you failed to grant his last request.”
Simon is liberated in 1945, and one day, a sunflower reminds him of Karl and his mother’s address. He goes there and, in discussion with her, he realizes that Karl’s mother still believes that her son died an innocent young man.
“I can well believe what people said,” she says to Wiesenthal, “so many dreadful things happened. But one thing is certain, Karl never did any wrong. He was always a decent young man.”
Simon doesn’t reveal to her the truth about Karl.
Once again, he remains silent, choosing not to diminish her faith in the goodness of her son.
“There are many kinds of silence,” concludes Wiesenthal. “Indeed it can be more eloquent than words, and it can be interpreted in many ways.”
“Was my silence at the bedside of the dying Nazi right or wrong?” Simon asks, before directing this question to the reader of his book:
Book Two: The Symposium
In the second part of Wiesenthal’s book, 53 people – from writers to architects, from jurists to human rights activists, from Holocaust survivors to former Nazis, from religious to political leaders, from victims of the genocide in Bosnia to victims of the genocide in Tibet – try to answer this question.
And these are their answers.
9 of the interviewed people don’t really give an answer, choosing not to say definitely if forgiveness was the right or the wrong thing to do in the situation.
These 9 come from very different backgrounds: three of them are Judaists, four Christians (Protestant, Lutheran, Presbyterian, and Roman Catholic), one a Muslim, and one not a religious person.
It is the answer of the last one – Hubert G. Locke – which we feel that, somehow, sums up the opinion of these nine: perhaps Simon’s silence 
 the right answer, if not the only imaginable one. 
“If God was silent,” writes Locke, “dare any of us speak?”
34 out of 53 respondents – which is about 65% of the interviewees – gave a negative answer to Simon Wiesenthal’s question: in their opinion, you shouldn’t forgive one if he merely repents for his sins.
Interestingly enough, most of these 34 respondents are Judaists: 19 to be exact. And this makes sense since their “no” is connected to Judaism’s fundamental idea regarding forgiveness, the one uttered by Josek to Simon in the camp.
Namely, that only those who have been sinned against can forgive the sinners. If one is killed, the perpetrator can never be forgiven – at least here, on Earth.
Even a non-religious person such as Bulgarian-French polymath Tzvetan Todorov shares this opinion, summing it up thus:
Primo Levi, a Holocaust survivor himself, offers yet another reason: “the figure of the SS man as portrayed in [Simon’s] book does not appear as fully reinstated from the moral point of view.”
Why?
Because he’s asking for a Jew to utter his forgiveness – 
 Jew; meaning, even on his deathbed, he still doesn’t think of the Jewish people as anything other than a distinguishable half-human group of people, which is how everything began in the first place.
And then there are the 10 forgivers.
Almost unsurprisingly, just like Bolek, most of them are Christians, and the other three are Buddhists.
All of them think that though difficult, the answer to Simon’s question is “yes, he should have forgiven Karl.”
Why?
Well, first of all, because forgiveness is the only path toward a more peaceful future, and because it is not the same as forgetfulness.
Also, because forgiveness gives peace of mind to the forgiver as well – and Simon Wiesenthal doesn’t deserve to be haunted by Karl’s memory; forgiving him may have helped him more than not forgiving him.
The Dalai Lama retells “an interesting incident” to make his point (made in 
as well):
Desmond Tutu, the coauthor with the Dalai Lama of 
, concurs, reminding the readers of Jesus’s words on the cross – “Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.” – and of a similar example to the one offered by Tenzin Gyatso.
Namely, his very own president: 
.
It was him forgiving the whites (who took 27 years of his life) which made South Africa the country that it is today.
Key Lessons from “The Sunflower”
1.      Would You Forgive Your Tormentor If He Sincerely Asked You To?
2.      Judaists Think That There’s a Limit to Forgiveness
3.      Christians and Buddhists Believe That Forgiveness Is Always the Rightful Path 
Would You Forgive Your Tormentor If He Sincerely Asked You To?
The question posed in the title of this lesson is the reason why Simon Wiesenthal wrote and published 
.
It is an event which has haunted him to this very day: back in 1943, a terminally wounded Nazi soldier asked him to forgive his sins in the name of all Jews.
Simon remained silent.
What would you do? – he asks after telling his story.
Judaists Think That There’s a Limit to Forgiveness
Most of Simon’s Judaist friends think that his silence was the best answer possible: under no circumstance, he was allowed to forgive the Nazi soldiers.
They offer two reasons: 1) repentance doesn’t mean salvation 
; and, more importantly, 2) nobody is entitled to forgive someone else’s sins.
Christians and Buddhists Believe That Forgiveness Is Always the Rightful Path
Even though they acknowledge the difficulty of the situation, most of the Christians and Buddhists asked by Simon Wiesenthal chose a different path: forgiving the Nazi soldier.
They too have reasons, at least three of them: 1) forgiving doesn’t mean forgetting; 2) a murderer can’t be forgiven by his victim by definition; and 3) we’ll never attain peace (both individually and as a humanity) unless we learn to forgive each other.

Final Notes
Touching and thought-provoking, 
is a unique book.
Both a memoir and a symposium, it is certainly one of the most haunting books you’ll ever read, not merely because of its story, but also (and maybe even more) because of the question it poses and the differing answers this question instigates among various people.
In case you wonder, we still don’t have one. 
But, we guess, that’s why some books are better than others: when their authors don’t have an answer, they are satisfied with merely posing the right questions.
And Simon Wiesenthal’s question is one of the most difficult you’ll ever have to think about."

“The science of learning is, at bottom,” writes Benedict Carey, “a study of the mental muscle doing the work – the living brain – and how it manages the streaming sights, sounds, and scents of daily life.”
“That it does so at all,” he adds, “is miracle enough. That it does so routinely is beyond extraordinary.”
So, what will you be able to see if you’re allowed a peek behind the curtains? Who are the protagonists, what are the relations between them, what helps them do a better job and what doesn’t?
Unsurprisingly, the guys we’re interested in when studying memory are the 100 
 neurons which make up the grey matter of your brain.
Now, these guys are stimulated constantly. Memories are nothing more but patterns of stimulations. 
To understand this better, say that you have merely 10 neurons. If an event stimulates three of them in the order 1–5–8, these three neurons would form a pattern, a network of neurons which are called synapses.
Each time you’d try to recall that memory, these synapses will be stimulated yet again; that way, they grow thicker; and the thicker they are – the more you remember something.
There’s a twist, though.
Most of the conscious here-and-now memories are stored by the neurons located in the hippocampus; however, after a while, if they are important enough, they are transferred to the neocortex. 
That’s why people whose hippocampus is destroyed are still able to remember old stuff, though unable to create new memories.
We’ve already introduced you to guys such as 
, an International Grandmaster of Memory and two-time Memory World Record holder, and 
, the 2006 US Memory Champion.
There’s an interesting thing science has discovered – and Benedict Carey wants you to know about them: the ‘losers’ in these memory competitions stumble not because they remember too little, but because they remember too much. 
In other words, they are, in a way, much more incapable of 
the wrong things remembering the right ones.
What does that say about how we learn?
Well, writes Carey, “if recollecting is just that – a re-collection of perceptions, facts, and ideas scattered in intertwining neural networks in the dark storm of the brain – then forgetting acts to block the background noise, the static, so that the right signals stand out. The sharpness of the one depends on the strength of the other.”
In other words, remembering, counterintuitively, doesn’t work without forgetting. 
Contrary to what your textbooks would have you believe, it’s much easier to remember things than forget them.
The problem is your brain stores all kind of information, and the trick is how to teach it to store the 
information, the one you’re actually interested in.
“Using memory changes memory,” writes Carey, “and for the better. Forgetting enables and deepens learning, by filtering out distracting information and by allowing some breakdown that, after reuse, drives retrieval and storage strength higher than they were originally.”
“Those are the basic principles that emerge from brain biology and cognitive science,” he concludes, “and they underlie – and will help us understand – the various learning techniques yet to come.”
Part Two: Retention
You’ve probably heard this quite a few times, but it’s worth pointing it out again: the surroundings during a study session affect your ability to remember things.
Possibly the most famous proof of this is the opening scene in Marcel Proust’s 
 when the main protagonist suddenly remembers the all-but-forgotten early days of his life after tasting a madeleine, the cookie which on Sunday mornings his aunt gave him when he was merely a child. 
And a study by a psychologist named Steven M. Smith has proved this.
In 1985, Smith had a group of 54 Psych 101 students study a list of 40 words. The students were divided into three groups: one group studied in silence, another group was listening to Milt Jackson’s ‘People Make the World Go Around,’ and a third one studied to Mozart.
The students spent ten minutes memorizing the words and two days later were asked to retrieve them without a prior warning.
You guess what happened!
If one studied to Mozart and was asked to recall words while Mozart was once again playing in the background – he did twice as good as one who studied to Mozart and was asked to recall words in silence or to the tune of “People Make the World Go Around.”
Apparently, the music didn’t matter: the same equation held true for the ones who studied while listening to Milt Jackson. But silence did: the ones who studied in silence remembered twice less than the others, regardless of which environment they were asked to remember the words.
However, what this research shows is not that we need to learn with music – but that we need to change the context if we want to remember the 
itself without 
 
.
Has your mother ever told you something along the lines of “Honey, don’t you think it would be better to study for a little bit tonight and a little bit tomorrow, rather than trying to learn everything at once?”
Well, if she has – then (surprise! surprise!), she was right, and you (chances are) were wrong not to heed to her advice.
The technique your mother suggested is called, scientifically, 
 or, more commonly, the 
.
It means that people learn at least as much – and retain it a lot longer – when they distribute (or “space”) their study time as opposed to concentrating it.
In layman’s terms: cramming the night before the exam will probably help you pass the exam as much as spacing out the study material over the week. However, by the time the second semester comes, you’ll probably remember nothing.
“In terms of reliability,” Carey uses a nice analogy, “nocturnal sprint is a little like overstuffing a cheap suitcase: the contents hold for a while, then everything falls out.”
The lesson?
If you want to pass the exam, it doesn’t make any difference whether you’ll cram or space out; however, if you 
 want to learn and remember something than cramming is the very, very wrong way to go.
It will get you a degree, sure – but not knowledge.
Have you ever found yourself in a situation such as this?
You’ve just finished reading an interesting book, and your colleagues start a conversation related to the topic this book examines.
You feel confident to interrupt them: “But no – that’s not the way things are.” 
And then you start explaining the things you’ve just learned and, even though at home you felt like you’ve understood everything, suddenly you are unable to clarify even the basic premises.
Stage fright?
Could be – but it 
 not.
What it is – a misjudgment of the depth of your knowledge.
In other words, you had the right neurons fired up while reading, you did; but the synapses you just formed were too weak and gangling to help you remember the things afterward.
The solution?
If you want to remember something well, try explaining it to someone else, even if that someone is, well, you.
Test your knowledge in the silence of your room in any way possible – because that’s not actually testing, but 
.
And it is not just regular studying – it is studying “the high-octane kind, 20 to 30 percent more powerful than if you continued sitting on your butt, staring at that outline. Better yet, those exercises will dispel the fluency illusion. They’ll expose what you don’t know, where you’re confused, what you’ve forgotten—and fast. That’s ignorance of the best kind.”
Part Three: Problem Solving
True, we live in a distraction-
 world and, as you probably already know, distractions are not helpful if you want to do some 
.
Interestingly enough, they seem to be a shortcut to a better problem-solving ability.
Yup, we’re talking about 
.
We still don’t know why – but studies have confirmed it over and over again – taking a break from a project helps you finish that project not merely 
 
 but also 
 
.
For one reason or another, a period of incubation (a period during which you’re not thinking about a project) makes you 
 capable of solving problems.
A decade ago, a pair of psychologists at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom – Ut Na Sio and Thomas C. Ormerod – tried to understand this phenomenon better and their final results are as thus.
First of all, they concluded that the incubation effect is real. However – and secondly – it doesn’t always work as expected, because of the circumstances and the distractions included.
Sio and Ormerod divided incubation breaks into three categories:
• 
 (like listening to music);
• 
 (like surfing the Internet); 
• 
 (like writing a short essay).
Well, it seems that as far as math or spatial problems are concerned, you can benefit from either of these three. However, in the case of linguistic problems (such as anagrams), only the second category actually helps.
Also, incubation periods seem to work better if they are longer – i.e., about 20 minutes – and don’t do the job if they are short (i.e., 5 minutes).
The most important thing?
“People don’t benefit from an incubation break unless they have reached an 
.” Or, in layman’s terms: “Knock off and play a videogame too soon and you get nothing.”
We guess percolation is not a word you’ve heard before – not unless you’ve read this book. 
Because it is a word Carey introduces to describe something usually mixed up with incubation – namely, to describe longer-term, cumulative thinking processes similar to incubation.
“To solve messier, protracted problems,” writes Carey, “we need more than a 
, a short break here and there. We need an 
.”
If you are an artist or a poet, you probably already know what we’re talking about.
“I have to be alone,” explained once Joseph Heller, “A bus is good. Or walking the dog. Brushing my teeth was marvelous – it was especially so for 
. Often when I am very tired, just before going to bed, while washing my face and brushing my teeth, my mind gets very clear… and produces a line for the next day’s work or some idea way ahead. I don’t get my best ideas while actually writing.”
This may have to do a lot with something called the 
after Russian psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik.
She was a student of Gestalt psychologist Kurt Lewin who once noticed that a waiter remembers better the unpaid orders than the paid ones.
After she did a couple of experiments, she realized that this is a natural bias: we tend to remember better things that are not finished than finished ones.
Why?
Because finishing them is akin to crossing out something on your checklist: a cue for your brain to stop thinking about it anymore.
The reverse is true as well: constantly starting something “often gives that job the psychological weight of a goal, even if it’s meaningless.”
Consequently, interruption pushes the thing you’re interrupting to the top of your mental to-do list.
And that’s percolation at its best!
Have you ever heard the phrase: “it’s not an adventure until something goes wrong”?
If so, you already know that it comes from the world of climbers and hikers, where wrong means 
: “a rope snaps; the food supply flies overboard; a bear crawls into the tent.”
And you know what happens next: suddenly climbers and hikers start to think more clearly and understand things they wouldn’t otherwise.
Why?
Well, because we’re creatures of habit and 
. While that is good for your body and your brain in terms of conserving energy for later, it is not good for your learning capabilities.
Because adapting to something puts your brain on autopilot; and you don’t want your brain to be on autopilot if you really want to 
 something.
The solution?
.
Interleaving is a cognitive science word, but it simply means “mixing related but distinct material during study.”
Basically, it is the reason why your music teacher switches from scales to theory, to pieces all in one sitting; it’s not a bad idea – but, actually, the 
 one.
Interleaving is “essentially, about preparing the brain for the unexpected,” a “way of building into our daily practice not only a dose of review but also an element of surprise.”
It is – to use an analogy – a sort of an alarm, a reminder, a cue to signal your brain that it shouldn’t be on autopilot.
Part Four: Tapping the Subconscious
is the reason 
.
Namely, he’s not able to see 
 than the other QBs in a shorter time; quite the opposite: he’s able to see 
, aka discern the 
things in an instant.
When you’re in the pocket, there are so many things happening around you that it is fairly difficult to realize what’s happening even as an outsider watching it on TV.
The moment you find out what has 
 happened is the slo-mo replay.
Well, in a way, Brady sees it in slow motion throughout: that’s why, for many sports players, the phrase “the game has slowed down for me” is practically synonymous with “now, I make better decisions.”
The mechanism underlying this is 
: the ability to see only what it matters. And if there’s such thing as perceptual seeing, there’s also a thing such as perceptual learning.
According to Eleanor Gibson, a pioneer in the field, perceptual learning has three traits:
• It is not a passive absorption, but an 
, “in the sense that exploring and searching for perception itself is active.” In other words, “we do not just see, we look; we do not just hear, we listen.”
• It is also 
, “in the sense that modification occurs without the necessity of external reinforcement;”
• Finally, it is 
, “with the goal of extracting and reducing the information simulation.” 
To sum up, “the system works to find the most critical perceptual signatures and filter out the rest.” Tom Brady doesn’t need to see everything: he just needs to see the movements of the people who might stop him.
He filters out the rest.
And “discovery of distinctive features and structure in the world is fundamental in the achievement of this goal.”
“If only I could sleep less than three hours – I would have learned 
 more!”
Now, how many times have you said that before an important exam?
If you’re like most of the students – probably at least three or four times a year. Which is exactly the number of times you were wrong about it!
We don’t know a lot about sleeping, but we do know this: it is so intricately related to memory, that it is virtually impossible to consolidate new memories if you remain awake for longer periods of time.
However, as you know full well, there are different phases of sleep, and some of them are more important to certain types of activities than others; even more importantly, sleeping during different periods of the day makes a difference as well.
For example, if you are interested in retaining facts and learning vocabulary words, then it’s best to go to bed early in the night; however, if you are a creative person, then you better become a night owl: creative thinking requires REM sleep, and this happens mostly in the morning hours.
Now that you know this, it’s time to start a 
 in your life; which is essentially the same as a studying revolution.
“I no longer think of naps or knocking off early as evidence of laziness, or a waste of time, or, worst of all, a failure of will,” concludes Carey. “I think of sleep as learning with my eyes closed.”

3.      Change the Studying Context and Test Yourself to Remember Better
Remembering Is Not the Opposite of Forgetting – But Its Corollary
We learn and remember things by creating networks of neurons called synapses; the thicker these synapses are, the more long-term the memory and the easier to recall it.
However, if you want to remember specific things, then the trick is to forget everything else
Forgetting acts as a sort of a background noise blocker, a static, which makes the right signal stand out.
As Carey says, the sharper your forgetting, the stronger your memory.
Incubation, Percolation, and Interleaving: Three Concepts to Know If You Want to Solve Problems
Incubation, percolation and interleaving are three interrelated concepts which can help you solve problems better.
Incubation is basically another word for the Eureka effect: we tend to see old problems better after a 20-minute break.
Percolation is the same, but over a longer period: if you want to write a better novel, then interrupt writing it daily with a long walk or something like it; this will stimulate to think of better ideas.
Finally, interleaving means mixing things up: don’t learn just theory and then practice, but learn a chunk of theory, then practice it, then another chunk of it.
Change the Context and Test Yourself to Remember Better
If you sometimes forget somebody’s name, go to the place where you met the person, and there’s a good chance that you’ll remember it.
The other side of this coin: if you really want to remember 
 regardless of the context, then study them in different situations and circumstances, so that they don’t get too attached to a certain set of conditions.
Also, once you do learn them, test your knowledge by transforming your mental knowledge into a speech. 
That is the only way for you to realize whether you know them fluently.

: 
Who Should Read “Doughnut Economics”? And Why?
 is a book by an economist for people who are not interested in economy; also, for people who have had it enough with the discipline, believing (like us) that it’s stopped being a science ever since it proclaimed itself as one.
Finally, it is a book for all those concerned that economic growth has all but destroyed our planet; this is one of the rare books by economists which prefers the latter to the former.
In fact, that’s its main idea.
Doughnut Economics Summary
Unfortunately, economics has failed us – over and over again.
As 
 demonstrated – for the thousandth time – economics is not capable of predicting, let alone preventing apocalyptic events which cause the downfall of corporations and cost thousands of people their homes and even lives.
And you know why is that?
Well, as 
 – who fervently advocates the cancelation of the Nobel Prize for Economics – has made it clear on more than one occasion, it is because economics is not actually as scientific as all those equations and graphs would have you believe.
Simply put, financial crises happen over and over again because our existent economic model (
) has these crises embedded within it.
If you need an analogy to understand, 
: it explains a lot about our world, so we brush away the mistakes by thinking that they are outliers or anomalies.
But how many anomalies should we allow before realizing that the 
 might be wrong?
“You never change things by fighting the existing reality,” Kare Raworth reminds us of Buckminster Fuller’s well-known quote in the introductory chapter of 
“To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”
“This book,” she goes on, “takes up his challenge, setting out seven mind-shifting ways in which we can all learn to think like twenty-first-century economists. By revealing the old ideas that have entrapped us and replacing them with new ones to inspire us, it proposes a new economic story that is told in pictures as much as in words.”
So, before we proceed to the words of our summary, here’s its pictorial version, provided by Raworth:
1. Change the Goal: from GDP to the Doughnut
Regardless of where you’re living, there’s a good chance that your government’s main economic (and even political) goal is the country’s GDP growth.
Interestingly enough, it wasn’t always like that.
In fact, for most of history, economics wasn’t interested in continual growth but in ways to properly manage the household (which is what the word 
 actually means in Ancient Greek).
Consequently, nobody considered economics a scientific discipline for millennia: it was an art form, more akin to literature than to mathematics. Sure, there are some rules you should follow, but there are many 
 goals to achieve as well.
This changed with 
, John Stuart Mill, and Milton Friedman who were interested in rationally deducing the laws which govern our economic lives; too bad none of them really cared about (or even knew) 
.
And this left a void where there was none: suddenly, nobody knew what was the goal of economics, even though originally the field was founded mainly with its objective in mind. 
The result?
A somewhat invented goal: GDP growth.
The problem?
Well to quote Simon Kuznets, “the hallowed creator of national income itself,”: “Distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth, between its costs and return, and between the short and the long term… Objectives should be explicit: goals for ‘more’ growth should specify more growth of what and for what.”
Well, that’s where Doughnut Economics comes in.
Its name comes from Kate Raworth’s visual representation of its objective:
As you can see from the graph, doughnut economics has a pretty discernible goal: to reach the sweet (and safe and just) spot between the social foundation of human well-being and the ecological ceiling of planetary pressure.
For all of humanity.
2. See the Big Picture: from Self-Contained Market to Embedded Economy
If you are an economist – or have seen an economics textbook published in the 20
 century – you have probably already seen the image below:
Supposedly, this Circular Flow diagram should explain away macroeconomy; and for many economists out there, it does.
The problem?
It is utterly and completely wrong.
And there are two reasons why it is wrong.
The first one: the market isn’t self-contained, and it isn’t the only economic sector which creates value. Too neoliberal or libertarian to believe that?
Well, allow Kate Raworth to ask you a question: who cooked Adam Smith’s dinner?
Her answer:
In other words, unpaid household labor creates a lot of value; otherwise, you won’t have Wikipedia.
The second problem is even bigger: the economy isn’t a closed system.  It is – as Herman Daly first suggested – “an open subsystem of the closed Earth system.”
And it looks something like this:
In other words, an economy which constantly grows will one day be brought to a halt when it inevitably overshoots Earth’s regenerative capacities.
And that day is, well, today.
3. Nurture Human Nature: From Rational Economic Man to Social Adaptable Humans
According to Kate Raworth, the most influential portrait in the history of civilization isn’t Leonardo da Vinci’s 
, but the “equally enigmatic yet utterly different character… the rational economic man.”
Despite being
“the smallest unit of analysis in economic theory,” this 
 is such an exaggerated and distorted version of 
that it’s basically a caricature, if not a cartoon.
You know him well: he/she is the “solitary, calculating, competing and insatiable” creature, 
 who (to paraphrase John Stuart Mill) desires to possess wealth and luxuries, but deeply disdains work.
Now, even Mill was aware that his caricature was a caricature, describing his 
 of the 
 as “an arbitrary definition of man,” based on “premises which might be totally without foundation.”
Foundations-shmoundations, said just about every economist after him and proceeded to develop a concept of the economy in general with this being as the atomic foundation.
Of course, everything economics says it’s wrong, because, as we now know full well, humans are 
, social creatures who often make decisions based on a complex network of premises.
For example, as both 
, most humans value fairness far above selfishness and are willing to lose things if they see injustice in winning them.
The only exception of this group – economists, influenced by the vision of the rational man from their textbooks.
So, let’s influence humanity in a different manner altogether.
What should replace 
?
“Many new names have been proposed,” writes Raworth, “from 
 and 
 to 
 and 
. But it makes no sense to pin ourselves down to just one of these identities: we inhabit them all simultaneously.”
And that’s a 
.
4. Get Savvy with Systems: From Mechanical Equilibrium to Dynamic Complexity
But if humans are so complex, then how do market balance themselves?
Well, the truth is: they don’t. If they did, things such as 
 or the financial crisis of 2008 shouldn’t have happened in the first place.
Of course, hardcore market-believers would say, well, even though they did, after a while, they balanced themselves out. 
However, this is wrong on so many levels that we don’t even feel the need to refute it (for one, some people earn a lot of money in the process, and others 
 – and, really, is this what economics should be all about?)
Anyway, if you think that the market is all about “supply and demand” and believe in the “equilibrium point,” then you’re thinking too simplistic, and you’ll 
have to deal with bubble-boom-bust cycles.
The image you know from your textbooks –
– should be immediately replaced by a more complicated one which really shows the inner workings of a complex system (because that’s what the economic system is):
Confused about those chickens and eggs in the graph?
Well, the image shows how feedback loops work and uses an analogy to describe it. 
Imagine chickens living by the road and laying eggs. More eggs mean more chickens and more chickens mean more eggs. This is the left side of the graph which demonstrates how a reinforcing loop works (R), amplifying what is happening.
However, there’s also a balancing loop (B) on the right side. It works like this: more chickens → more road crossings → more deaths → fewer chickens. The balancing loop counters the reinforcing one.
“It is out of these interactions of stocks, flows, feedbacks and delays,” writes Raworth, “that complex adaptive systems arise: complex due to their unpredictable emergent behavior, and adaptive because they keep evolving over time.”
5. Design to Distribute: From ‘Growth Will Even It Up Again’ To Distributive by Design
We quoted him above, we’ll quote him again: Simon Kuznets, a guy who won a Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his contribution to the transformation of economics into empirical science.
Also: the guy who gave us this:
Above you can see the Kuznets curve which suggests – if it is not obvious enough already – that as countries get richer, inequality must rise before it will eventually fall. 
In other words, if you want economic success then you’d better deal with economic inequality because that’s an inevitable stage of it; as for equality – that should come a bit later.
In other words, “development 
 be inegalitarian” (W. Arthur Lewis, also a Nobel Prize winner), so “poor countries should concentrate income in the hands of the wealthy since only they would save and invest enough of it to kick-start GDP growth.”
Good news – for the rich. 
Bad news for just about everyone else.
Because, you see, even though you can apparently get a Nobel Prize for it and the Kuznets curve is still considered an economic law (so much so that 
), this theory is merely clever, but utterly and dreadfully wrong.
And you know how we know this?
Well, first of all, because Kuznets himself said that. Both in private correspondence – “no evidence whatsoever” – and (well, this is tragic) in the very texts where he introduced the idea, which, in his words, was based on “5 percent empirical information and 95 percent speculation, some of it possibly tainted by wishful thinking.”
And secondly, because when 
.
The solution?
To start thinking about creating a society where development is 
Because it 
 possible.
6. Create to Regenerate: From ‘Growth Will Clean It Up Again’ To Regenerative by Design
Another thing mainstream economists are pretty sure will sort out itself with growth?
The Earth.
And once again, the problems are created by the very people who believe they’ve discovered a law which demonstrates that they’ll be sorted out.
In this case, American economists Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger did a study in the 1990s and supposedly discovered that pollution decreases with growth – after increasing for a while.
You can notice the pattern here, can you?
It’s basically the same idea that Kuznets had as far as inequality is concerned.
In fact, the graphs are so similar that this one we don’t even need to copy/paste here; you’ll just figure it out via its giveaway name: Environmental Kuznets Curve.
The problem with this curve?
Well, apparently – and once again – that even its authors didn’t believe it. Unfortunately, everybody else did – and by 
 we do mean rich people in power – and soon it was difficult to debate with people that growth might mean serious environmental problems.
“Of course it does,” they’d say. “But they’ll sort out themselves in the end.”
The logic may be sound on paper – technological advancements create environmental problems, but if not regulated they also come up with solutions for these very same problems – but the data doesn’t support it.
On the contrary: it seems we may already be near the last return point. (If we’re past it then thanks, 
 economists and God help us!) 
And maybe we should try to do something before it’s too late.
And that something is quite obvious: transform our linear, caterpillar economy into a circular, butterfly one, shifting from a present filled with disposable products to a future of reusable goods. 
True, we’ve already started doing this.
But we need to do even more.
7. Be Agnostic about Growth: From Growth Addicted to Growth Agnostic
It all pointed to this, didn’t it?
As strange as it may seem at first glance, it’s even stranger how it hasn’t become part of the mainstream science of today.
Bear with Raworth for a second.
Studies and empirical data have demonstrated – beyond reasonable doubt – that, at least so far, “no country has ever ended human deprivation without a growing economy. And no country has ever ended ecological degradation with one.”
In other words, if we want a better quality of life for more people, then it’s only smart to devise ways for our economy to grow; however, if we don’t want to destroy the resources which allow it to grow, then we must hinder its growth.
The solution?
Well, that doughnut from the start: finding the right balance. 
But that all starts with an almost counterintuitive notion: after a certain limit, economic growth is probably not good anymore.
In layman’s terms: there should be such thing as 
 money.
, but we seem to have forgotten it.
So, Raworth proposes rebuilding our system so that we are constantly reminded that hoarding (especially 
) is not only selfish but, in the long run, detrimental to everybody 
you.
An Argentinian-German businessman by the name of Silvio Gessel – who lived between the 19
 and the 20
 century – proposed a solution for this: “we must make money worse as a commodity if we wish to make it better as a medium of exchange.’”
Money, in other words, ages well: unlike most commodities (be they potatoes or smartphones), it 
 with time.
A good way to inspire people not to 
 money?
Introduce money which 
value the longer it is held.
It’s called demurrage, and you should really read all about it.
Key Lessons from “Doughnut Economics”
1.      Economics Has Failed Us Big Time
2.      Seven Ways in Which Economics Is Wrong About the World – and Seven Ways to Fix This
3.      Doughnut Economics Is All About Thriving While Preserving the Planet 
Economics Has Failed Us Big Time
“Economics,” to quote Kate Raworth, “is broken.”
Not only it has failed to predict financial crises which have shaken our society to its very foundations, but it has also shown no interest even to devise ways to prevent these in the future.
Economics’ “outdated theories have permitted a world in which extreme poverty persists while the wealth of the super-rich grows year on year. And its blind spots have led to policies that are degrading the living world on a scale that threatens all of our futures.”
Seven Ways in Which Economics Is Wrong About the World – and Seven Ways to Fix This
There are seven ways in which mainstream economics is fundamentally wrong about the world – and seven things to do if we want to get back on track:
#1. Mainstream economists believe that the rise of GDP should be the goal; in fact, it should be the doughnut (wait… what? See lesson number 3 for more).
#2. Self-contained markets don’t exist; embedded economy is the real deal.
#3. The idea of the rational and selfish economic man is utterly wrong; homo sapiens is both the most irrational and “the most cooperative of all species when it comes to living alongside those who are beyond next of kin;”
#4. Mechanical equilibrium is possible only in closed and predictable systems; reorient to understand dynamic complexity if you want to understand the market;
#5. Growth doesn’t bring equality; distribution should be part of the economic systems by design;
#6. Growth doesn’t solve environmental problems as well; economic systems should be regenerative by design; and, finally,
#7. Economic systems should not be about never-ending growth – that is not possible – but about thriving within limits.
Doughnut Economics Is All About Thriving While Preserving the Planet
The essence of Doughnut Economics is this: to create “a social foundation of well-being that no one should fall below, and an ecological ceiling of planetary pressure that we should not go beyond. Between the two lies a safe and just space for all.”
In other words, we are all humans, and we all live on this planet; let’s all live our lives as humans and 
destroy our planet.

Final Notes
In our humble opinion, 
is practically 
an economics book for the 21
 century should be: comprehensible, environmentally-friendly, aware of the challenges that lie ahead, interested in solutions which favor humanity as a whole (and not merely a certain group of people).
And unlike most economic books, it is also honest, out-of-the-box enlightening, and prefers images to equations.
Kate Raworth – thank you.
The rest of you – please read the book."

: 
Who Should Read “The Upside of Irrationality”? And Why?
If you enjoyed reading 
– Ariely’s debut book – then 
is the book you’ve been waiting for.
Since we can say pretty much the same thing about Ariely’s other two books – 
 and 
– it’s safe to say that this is an author it makes a lot of sense to follow.
In case you don’t know him, and you need a reason why we’ll give you one: Ariely is a sort of 
/
 mashup.
Consequently, 
is a perfect gift for psychology and behavioral economics students; but everyone interested in the irrational aspects of human behavior should read it.
The Upside of Irrationality Summary
“There is a great deal to be learned from rational economics,” writes Dan Ariel in the “Introduction” to his second book, “but some of its assumptions – that people always make the best decisions, that mistakes are less likely when the decisions involve a lot of money, and that the market is self-correcting – can clearly lead to disastrous consequences.”
Why?
Well, for the simple reason that, despite our biological designation in the hierarchy of species, we are actually 
rational beings.
“How else do you explain,” Ariely poses a rhetorical question, “why millions of gym memberships go unused or why people risk their own and others’ lives to write a text message while they’re driving?”
About the latter: you wouldn’t expect transportation to work without proper regulation measures, now, would you? After all, despite seat belts, rearview mirrors, antilock brakes, properly designed roads, and a thousand other safety precautions – people still make all kinds of errors while driving.
“Now think about 
,” writes Ariely:
And this is where 
comes in handy; it is a book of experiments which uncover our irrational sides – and all the downsides and benefits from them in a real-world environment.
The book is divided into two parts, each of which contains five different aspects of our irrational behavior.
Part I: The Unexpected Ways We Defy Logic at Work
If you give an electric shock to a rat put in a maze, expectedly, the first thing that would come to that rat’s mind would be “good lord, they’re going to kill me here: I need to find an escape right now!”
However, if you up the intensity of the shock, the rat doesn’t perform better – i.e., doesn’t find the escape route faster – but, on the contrary, struggles much more; after a certain point, it is just too shocked to find the escape route altogether.
Now translate this into real-world human situations: 
 or does stress, after a certain point, hinders your performance?
Of course it’s the latter!
Interestingly enough, the same holds true for money bonuses. The bigger they are, the more stress they cause and the more mistakes the person promised to get them is bound to make.
There are times when this isn’t true – when people are tasked with mechanical or manual jobs – but they don’t get big bonuses to start with; the ones who do get (CEOs and high-level managers) perform much worse with a big-bonus incentive hanging over their heads.
The solution?
Incentivize within the averages.
In 1776, in 
 seminal economic work, 
,
Adam Smith – through a pretty famous pin factory example – suggested that “division of labor is an incredibly effective way to achieve higher efficiency in the production process.”
That’s true.
However, it is also inhuman: as Karl Marx argued about a century later in 
, division of labor alienates the workers from their work, demotivating them and making them much less interested not only in their work but in their lives as well.
For all this hate of communism around, it turns out that psychological studies prove Marx right.
In the one Ariely interprets in his book, two groups of people were paid to build Lego constructions individually; all of them were told they could quit any time they like.
After completing their structures, the people in the first group had them carefully examined by a researcher; the second group wasn’t as lucky: their Lego constructions were dismantled promptly upon completion.
The outcome?
Most of the people in the first group were quite happy to go on working; on the contrary, the majority of people from the second group lost all interest and were more likely to quit building altogether.
And really – do we value efficiency more than human dignity?
As the above two experiments already suggest, we feel much more pleasure when we are creatively engaged than when all we need to do is just manually complete a task.
This is called the IKEA effect because, well, the reasons are pretty obvious; however, the effects might not be at this moment.
To understand them better, feel free to ponder over this example.
Back in the 1940s, the home-baking world should have been revolutionized when companies discovered a way to create cake mixes which could magically turn into a cake in no time.
However, this didn’t happen: for some reason, women didn’t want to buy these cake mixes, even though, on the face of it, they saved them a lot of time.
And then Pillsbury realized why: they left out the dried egg from their mixes and marketed their products along the lines of “just add a fresh egg – and you’re done.”
This made all the difference: the simple effort of adding an egg to the mix was enough to make the housewives think that they’ve prepared the cake altogether.
Now, you can understand why brands are interested in offering you 
 products. 
Namely, you want to feel special, and you want to believe that you’ve made some contribution toward the completion of a product.
In other words, we don’t want maximized pleasure for minimum effort: we 
to be involved in one way or another.
And this is true even for animals.
Don’t believe us?

.
In a famous Mark Twain essay, “Some National Stupidities,” the great American author describes his utter bewilderment at the fact that the Americans of his day didn’t use German stoves, despite the fact that the latter were ten times better.
Well, psychologists now know the exact reason why this is happening: for the simple reason that it was not ours.
“The attraction to one’s own ideas,” writes Ariely, “has not escaped the collective folk wisdom of the business world, and, like other important business processes, this one also has an unofficial term attached to it: the ‘Not-Invented-Here’ (NIH) bias. The principle is basically this: ‘If I (or we) didn’t invent it, then it’s not worth much.’”
Stunningly, this means that even if you have exactly the same idea as someone else, you’d prefer your wording. What does that say about when you have different ideas?
Of course, there’s a good side to this: strong bias against ideas which come from the outside initiates internal research and development and results in support and reinforcement of the local economy.
“Like many other aspects of our interesting and curious nature,” concludes Ariely, “our tendency to overvalue what we create is a mixed bag of good and bad. Our task is to figure out how we can get the most good and least bad out of ourselves.”
Here’s a great game which fundamentally subverts the idea of 
.
Just called the Trust Game, this one begins with you and a friend of yours receiving $10 each. You are the one making the first move, which can be either keeping the money for yourself or giving it to your friend.
The latter one, of course, comes with a twist.
If you choose to give the money to your friend, the experimenter will quadruple it and ask the other participant to make the next move: either give you half of it or keep it all for himself.
So, in other words, you can either get $10, $25 or none whatsoever; your friend can either get $10, $50 or $25.
It is quite rational for your friend to not give you back anything; consequently, it is more than rational for you 
to give him the opportunity to decide for you.
$10 is not better than $25, but it is certainly better than $0 – and if we are rational people, that’s exactly what you’d get if you decide to give away your $10.
However, the Trust Game usually ends otherwise: with both people getting $25.
Why?
Because “people are more trusting and more reciprocating than rational economics would have us believe.”
And it gets even more irrational!
Namely, if player A doesn’t receive anything from his friend and is offered the option to for each dollar of his own money, $2 to be extracted from his friend, Player A would almost always spend $25 dollars so that his friend is left with nothing.
In other words, even though costly and completely irrational, revenge is just too sweet to be passed by.
And it is sweet because it (sometimes) spells justice.
Part II: The Unexpected Ways We Defy Logic at Home
“Man is a pliant animal,” wrote once Fyodor Dostoyevsky, “a being who gets accustomed to anything.”
Apparently, this is more than true: we get accustomed to just about everything, pain included.
There are two examples which prove this.
The more famous one includes a study of lottery winners. After the initial sense of euphoria, almost all of them revert to the state of happiness they had been before becoming millionaires. 
Another experiment shows the other side of the coin: even people who lose their legs or end up paralyzed after a car accident, somehow manage to adapt to the new limitations.
At this point, it may seem to you that this is something impossible, but, in fact, it is often the 
probable scenario: “numerous studies have shown that we adapt more quickly and to a larger degree than we imagine.”
This type of adaptation is called hedonic adaptation, and it is the reason why you stop feeling happy about your new shoes only a few days after buying them; it is also the reason why you buy new things constantly: you just fail to recognize your adaptation to the ones you’ve just bought.
A good way to hack this preprogrammed adaptive bias?
Hedonic disruptions.
It’s exactly what it means: whenever you’re feeling happy, find a way to interrupt that happiness so that you 
adapt to it. 
In other words, calling the one you love constantly will inevitably level out the love. 
Adaptation is also the reason why you feel bored in long-term relationships. So, do something new, something radical to disrupt the pattern.
“You don’t need to be an astute observer of human nature,” writes Ariely, “to realize that, in the world of birds, bees, and humans, like attracts like.”
In other words, “to a large degree, beautiful people date other beautiful people, and ‘aesthetically challenged’ individuals date others like them.”
This birds-of-a-feather phenomenon is usually referred to by scientists as “assortative mating.”
Now, it is easy to understand why the 10s date other 10s; what’s more difficult to explain is why do the “aesthetically challenged” 5s or 6s settle for other 5s or 6s? Why aren’t they interested in the 10s since, 
, it would be rational for them to prefer the more beautiful ones?
A great way to understand what happens in the world of aesthetic social hierarchy is if you think of Aesop’s fable “The Fox and the Grapes.” After the fox is unable to reach the enticing grapes, it walks away mumbling “I’m sure they were sour anyway.”
Well, this “sour grapes” strategy is what regulates the beauty market.
In other words, 5s or 6s start attributing more value to non-aesthetic and non-physical qualities, such as kindness or a sense of humor.
In addition – and this is the more interesting part – they start finding seemingly aesthetically pleasing traits 
.
So, next time you see someone rolling his eyes over a picture of Megan Fox or Brad Pitt, be aware that the guy or the girl are not lying: they have merely adapted to a world where they’d never get a Fox or a Pitt.
Online dating is a thing for at least two decades now; however, the stats conclusively prove that it doesn’t actually work: very few people meet their romantic partners online.
But why shouldn’t it work?
According to a study by Ariely, dating website users spent more than 5 hours a week scanning profiles, almost 7 hours emailing potential partners and about 2 hours a week meeting people face to face.
Surely, that has to lead somewhere, right?
Well, guess again.
The problem with online dating is pretty fundamental for the market ever to work. 
Namely, we don’t choose partners rationally. And dating sites are rational.
However, checklists, yes/no questions, hair color, and favorite movies don’t mean a thing if when you meet the guy/girl, 
 doesn’t click. 
And that something is still elusive enough for a dating site to ever work.
Though Ariely quotes him explicitly, Joseph Stalin never said this: “One man’s death is a tragedy, but a million deaths is a statistic.” 
On the other hand, Mother Teresa did say this: “If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at one, I will.”
Interestingly enough, though used to illustrate two very different outlooks on life, both things are thoroughly correct.
Psychological studies – and many, many experiments and real-world situations – prove over and over again that we’re incapable of comprehending large tragedies and are much more likely to empathize with a single person than a group of people (though the latter one is quite evidently worse).
Why?
Because of something we call the Identifiable Victim Effect, aka you’ll probably donate much more to a 3-year-old starved girl from Mali whose face you can see then to a cause such as “feed 11 million Ethiopians.”
Many charities know this and that explains all of those commercials: whether it is Save the Children or Children International, “the key to our wallets is to arouse our empathy” and “examples of individual suffering are one of the best ways to ignite our emotions (individual examples → emotions → wallets).
This is, of course, irrational. 
But does that mean that being utterly rational – i.e., a Mr. Spock – would solve things and make you a better person?
Probably not – because then you wouldn’t care about anyone besides the people you can benefit from: it 
irrational to care about someone who lives far away.
It is the mixture of these things – rationality and irrationality – which makes us human.
And, apparently, humane.
You’ve heard this lesson a few thousand times before, worded anywhere between “it’s not healthy to repress emotions” and “let it go when you feel like it.”
The problem?
Well, science says that this is basically the worst thing you can do.
Why?
Because short-term emotions program long-term decisions, i.e., they tend to transform themselves into a habit.
And why is that?
For the simple reason that we are programmed to act in accordance with our past actions. 
This is called self-herding, and it is the reason why some people start cursing a lot after having cursed once in quite a casual situation. In other words, if you do something once, the next time you’re found in a similar situation, your brain will try to instigate you to repeat that answer – because it doesn’t know better.
And this is why Ariely suggests that you should try canoeing, start living together or plan your wedding with your romantic partner way before you actually marry.
Joint behavior in environments that don’t have well-defined social protocols may reveal things that go far deeper than superficial attraction and behavioral precedents which are bound to repeat in the future.
“It is worthwhile,” writes Ariely, “to keep an eye open for deteriorating patterns of behavior. When we observe early-warning signs, we should take swift action to correct an undesirable course before the unfortunate patterns of dealing with each other fully develop.”
Chapter 11 – Lessons from Our Irrationalities: Why We Need to Test Everything
Ariely signs off with a great chapter, one that could be rightly deemed a data-based apology of experimentation.
Or, to turn that around, a head-on attack on intuition.
As these experiments show, Ariely warns, trusting your intuition is not exactly the best thing you can do in many, many situations.
So he fervently hopes that you will doubt your intuition and run your own experiments in an effort to make better decisions. 
“Ask questions,” he writes. “Explore. Turn over rocks. Question your behavior, that of your company, employees, and other businesses, and that of agencies, politicians, and governments. By doing so, we may all discover ways to overcome some of our limitations, and that’s the great hope of social science.”
Key Lessons from “The Upside of Irrationality”
1.      Rational Economics Has Human Nature Figured Out All Wrong
2.      You Overvalue Your Creations – and Wouldn’t Trade This Feeling Even for a Hefty Bonus
3.      You Are Just Too Adaptive to Be Happy
Rational Economics Has Human Nature Figured Out All Wrong
Many economists today believe that the market regulates things better than external regulators can; the reason being: we are rational enough to make decisions which go our way.
Unfortunately, this couldn’t be further from the truth: we are just as irrational as rational, and often we do things that defy logic, even if they are detrimental to us.
Just think of the sheer number of people drinking and driving or driving and texting – and you’ll understand full well.
You Overvalue Your Creations – and Wouldn’t Trade This Feeling Even for a Hefty Bonus
Apparently, after a certain amount, money can’t buy happiness or inspire you to act smarter and make better decisions. 
In fact, large amounts of money usually cause just too much stress and people who are promised them are likely to make many more mistakes than people who are promised, say, just a regular bonus.
There’s only one exception: manual work.
The reason?
We enjoy creating things, and this enjoyment is such that we prefer it over money; and when money causes stress, we don’t like it one bit; it makes us hate what we love without it.
In manual work, there’s no enjoyment, so the only motivation is money.
You Are Just Too Adaptive to Be Happy
Even if you win the lottery, there’s a high chance that after a while you’ll be no happier than you are at the moment.
Interestingly enough, the same holds true even if you suffer debilitating injury and remain paralyzed.
Apparently, people learn to adapt to everything, regardless of the amount of pain or happiness attached to it?
Consequently, your best shot at happiness is somewhat counterintuitive: disrupt it regularly, so it 
become a habit. 
In other words, it is better to spend a week 
calling your boyfriend/girlfriend than calling him/her every day – no matter how much you want to.
In this latter case, you’d probably just adapt to that level of happiness and stop feeling it altogether.

If you are a cricket fan, you already know what V. V. S. stands for in Laxman’s name:
Very Very Special Laxman, of course.
Well, here’s his autobiography:
.
Who Should Read “281 and Beyond”? And Why?
The easiest – and, perhaps, best, answer to the first question is: the one who knows who V. V. S. Laxman is.
In that case, we don’t even need to tell you why you should read this book: you already know it yourself.
However, if you don’t know Laxman, then we suppose this is not a book for you. Even if you watch cricket – because, well, what kind of a cricket fan is one who doesn’t know who Laxman is?
About V. V. S. Laxman
 – short for Vangipurapu Venkata Sai Laxman – is a former Indian cricketer.
An aggressive right-hand batsman, Laxman is widely considered one of the best cricket players of the 2000s, despite never being selected for a Cricket World Cup. In fact, Laxman is one of the very few players to have played 100 Tests without going to the World Cup.
Laxman’s knock of 281 against Australia in 2001 is often considered the greatest test inning in history.
His autobiography, 
, was co-written with R. Kaushik, a veteran and respected cricket writer.
“281 and Beyond PDF Summary”
Co-authored by R. Kaushik, 
 is the autobiography of V. V. S. Laxman, one of the greatest cricketers of, arguably, India’s greatest cricket generation.
The Story of 281
Some numbers just stick to the athletes associated with them. 
Think of 23, and there’s no way you think of anyone else but Michael Jordan and maybe LeBron James. Think of Wilt Chamberlain, and the number 100 comes to mind. Barry Bonds is all about 73, and Eric Dickerson about 2,105.
More relevantly, it’s difficult to think of Anil Kumble without thinking about his Perfect 10 against Pakistan in 1999, or of Sunil Gavaskar without harking back to 1983 and his unbeaten 236 against the West Indies.
Well, the number 281 is reserved for V. V. S. Laxman.
Taking into consideration the fact that it occurred against the Aussies in an all but lost position, and was, consequently, deemed by Cricket Monthly “
,” chances are, as long as men play and watch cricket, 281 will forever be the number of V. V. S. Laxman.
Very Very Special Laxman.
OK – we admit we don’t know that much about cricket, but even we could guess how V. V. S. Laxman’s biography would – and, actually, 
 – start.
Recalled to the national team at the beginning of 2000, V. V. S. Laxman was one of the very few bright spots for India during the disastrous Australian tour of that year (they say that India’s batsmen had quite a few nightmares of Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne during that year). 
In fact, while all the batsmen struggled to cope with McGrath, Laxman scored 167 in the third (and final) Test match in Sidney.
However, and somewhat surprisingly, Laxman decided to return to domestic cricket afterward, thinking that the role of opener didn’t suit him.
The result?
After being let go from the Test team in 1999 due to poor results, Laxman was once again dropped for almost the entirety of 2000. In fact, he barely found a spot in the team at the end of the year, just in time for the home series against Australia.
It is not that known – although it can be surmised by the fact that Laxman’s spine required straightening during his epic performance – but Laxman was close to not even playing the 2001 Test at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. 
A slipped disc had nearly benched him, so he requested all the help he could get from the physio, Andrew Leipus.
“I said,” Laxman recalls, “‘Tell me you can fix this Andrew.’ There was a salty taste in my mouth. I didn’t even realize I had started to cry. Perhaps it was the sight of a grown man weeping that did the trick.”
In retrospect, it’s safe to say it did a lot more than that.
“To call Eden Gardens my theatre of dreams is an understatement,” writes V. V. S. Laxman in 
. “It provided the canvas for the picture I wanted to paint, for the dreams I wanted to realize. Dreams that had taken shape a long, long ago, when the cricket bug bit me.”
But let’s set the scene first.
In the first Test at Mumbai, India’s entire batting line-up (well, all except for Tendulkar) capitulated before the Aussies handing their bitter rivals their 
 Test win.
And the second match at Kolkata didn’t seem any different – that is until the second evening when V. V. S. Laxman came to bat:
Based on what followed, that has to be one of the greatest understatements in the history of cricket. Though playing against the best attack in the world – on a team 222 runs behind – Laxman produced an extraordinary knock of 281!
Rahul Dravid’s stellar supporting role – the two paired up for record 376 – meant that India survived the fourth day of the Test.
On the wings of Laxman’s career-defining performance, his team rose from the ashes to eventually win not just the Test, but the series.
“As I played that wonderful inning of 281,” notes Laxman, “Adam Gilchrist said a few times ‘it’s like the Don is batting.’”
Indeed, it was.
On Becoming V. V. S.
And to think that Laxman might have never become V. V. S!
Born in Hyderabad to noted physicians Dr. Satyabhama and Dr. Shantaram – and, thus, the great-great nephew of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, India’s second president – it was only natural for Laxman to toy with the idea of becoming a doctor himself. 
“At 17,” writes Laxman, “I had to pick between cricket and medicine.” If the interest in the latter came via his parents, the love for the former Laxman owes to Mohammad Azharuddin’s feats against England. “Watching him rip England to shreds with a great 182 was nearly a personal success for me,” writes V. V. S.
Fortunately, Laxman’s uncle, Baba Krishna Mohan, backed his love and not his interest, firmly believing that V. V. S.  is talented enough to play for India; that sealed it. 
However, there was a condition: Laxman was given five years to make this dream come true; otherwise, it was back to medicine.
V. V. S. took this “if” quite seriously and spent the next five years living a life framed within 3Ds: discipline, determination, and dedication.
It was all cricket for him during those five years: no movies, no evening outings with friends, nothing. He even enrolled in college just so that he could play cricket, “not to study.”
The result?
Laxman debuted for India’s U-19 team against Australia in February 1994; he ended the series as the leading run-scorer. It was evident that a new star was in the making. 
Unfortunately, in his early years, Laxman had to accept the opener’s position – one he never enjoyed – much more often than he wanted. 
After a while, he decided to never again play as an opener. This cost him his place at the national team for a while; in the end, it all worked out.
On the Great Ones
Unsurprisingly, 
includes quite a few honest portraits of some of the greatest Indian cricketers to ever grace the willow game.
You can find more than a few paragraphs here on everybody, predominantly focused on the God of the Game, Sachin Tendulkar, the destructive batsman Virender Sehwag, and the long-time captains, Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly.
Commenting on Dravid’s captaincy, Laxman says that Rahul, always systematic and meticulous, was even more intense as a skipper than as a batsman. “He took everyone’s failures to heart,” he writes, even feeling that the captaincy is not a responsibility, but a burden. That’s why he relinquished the captaincy.
The same holds true for Sourav, who, feeling that cricket is more than just a game, constantly insisted on both team and individual effort, being okay with a defeat if his team gave its best and lost. However, he too felt the weight of the captaincy and, after being stripped of it, he came back to the team as a different man.
As for Sehwag’s philosophy of the game – he was, more or less, a firm believer that a game is won or lost even before beginning. Therefore, he constantly put pressure on the bowlers, playing with their minds throughout the game, and coming on top more often than not.
Finally, Tendulkar. Well, you don’t need V. V. S. to tell you that excellence was always floating in his mind. “When he put on the India colors,” he notes, Sachin “grew ten feet tall.”
On Greg Chappell
In May 2005, Greg Chappell, the pre-eminent Australian batsman of the 1970s, was appointed coach of the Indian national cricket team for a two-year term.
“I had been a huge fan of Chappell for a long time,” writes Laxman. “When he was appointed our coach, I was both happy and excited.”
This happiness wouldn’t last long: unfortunately, Greg was as bad at coaching as he was good at playing. “Brusque and abrasive, highly opinionated and rigid in his thinking,” Chappell, according to V. V. S. Laxman, had no man-management skills and “quickly sowed further seeds of discontent in an already diffident team:”
Often forgetful of the fact that it is the players who play the game and not the coach, Chappell apparently had favorites and looked after them more than well; the others were “left to fend for themselves.”
The result?
The team was disintegrating before Laxman’s very eyes.
Laxman’s verdict?
On His Early Retirement
Laxman was always deemed as a “sincere” and “ever-smiling” person; that’s why he was as loved and respected in the dressing room as he was by his fans on the stadium or in front of the TV. 
It was this love (from the fans, from the teammates, from his family, and especially his wife Sailaja) that got Laxman through some “dark days” of his career, especially his first thoughts about retirement when not being picked up for the 2003 World Cup and the time under Chappell.
And, then, a few years later, on August 18, 2012, Laxman suddenly announced his retirement, just a few days before a Test match against New Zealand in his hometown of Hyderabad.
Of course, this set off a wave of speculations – many conjectured that Laxman’s retirement was due to his differences with M. S. Dhoni – resulting in “the first and only controversy of [Laxman’s] cricketing career.”
The truth is – explains now Laxman – he has nothing but respect for Dhoni, and that he didn’t retire because of him or any other extraneous forces: he did it because of his “inner voice.”
“All my life, my actions had been dictated by this voice,” he writes, “but in conjunction with suggestions from those closest to me. This time, with greater maturity, I had gone entirely by it, disregarding advice from even my father.”
And his father wasn’t the only one to advise against the sudden retirement: Sachin tried to convince Laxman to postpone the press conference too. It was one of the few times he disregarded Tendulkar’s advice: “I told him repeatedly… that my mind was made up.”
“It was not the fairy-tale ending that cricketers dream of, but to me, it was a fairy-tale ending nonetheless because I had stepped down on my own terms,” he concludes.
Key Lessons from “281 and Beyond”
1.      Choose What Your Best At – and Go for It
2.      There’s Always Such Thing as a Second Chance (Even in Cricket)
3.      Handling Success Is as Difficult as Handling Failure
Choose What Your Best At – and Go for It
Despite repeatedly being chosen for the opener’s slot, V. V. S. Laxman didn’t feel comfortable at that position. 
And to make his stand loud and clear, back in 2000, he decided that he wasn’t going to play on that position anymore, whatever the cost.
For a while, this meant that he wasn’t going to play for India’s national team; but then, he returned – and the 281 happened.
In other words – focus on what you’re good at; and strive to become the best.
There’s Always Such Thing as a Second Chance (Even in Cricket)
When V. V. S. exploded with a 281 against the Australians back in 2001, the Aussies were on course to win their 17
 consecutive Test match against India.
Needless to add, V. V. S. was under tremendous pressure, and he delivered.
“I hadn’t missed out on 300 by 19 runs,” he writes, “I had made 281 in a crisis with our backs to the wall, and for the team.”
Describing the performance as “uncontroversial… sublime,” 
 wrote that Laxman, that few evenings “proved that there are second chances in Test cricket.”
There are also in life – even when everything seems lost and gone.
Handling Success Is as Difficult as Handling Failure
“It is tougher to handle success than failure,” writes Laxman honestly. “In India, if you are successful, you get carried away very easily. If you are going through a bad patch, you get support, and you work hard to bounce back. That’s why having a support system is crucial in such a situation.”
“We are not taught how to handle success,” he goes on. “I have seen a lot of talented players, who unfortunately do not have the support system, soon drift away. That not only happens because of how they are dealing with failure but also the success.”

Our Critical Review
Though sports biographies tend to disappoint from time to time, 
is not one of these cases.
It is interesting and nicely written, and it covers almost everything you’d expect, shedding some light over Laxman’s retirement, his relationship with Greg Chappell, and his thoughts on his teammates.
Of course, as the title suggests, there’s a whole chapter about 
knock of 281; it’s the first one and, by the end of it, the book pays back its price.

: “
Who Should Read “Make Time”? And Why?
Let us answer these questions with questions—the ones posed by the authors at the very beginning of 
“Do you ever look back and wonder ‘What did I really do today?’ Do you ever daydream about projects and activities you’ll get to someday—but ‘someday’ never comes?”
If so, then 
is the book for you. 
It is a book about reclaiming your time—and thus making your life your own again—and about getting enough moments in your life to spend them on the things that really matter.
Make Time Summary
The epigraph to 
a
quote by none other than Mahatma Gandhi—reveals a lot about its authors’ objectives: “There is more to life than increasing its speed.” 
In other words, Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky (or Jake and JZ as they refer to themselves) believe that “it is possible to feel less busy, be less distracted, and enjoy the present moment more. Maybe that sounds a little hippy-dippy,” they add, “but we’re serious.”
is the product of this line of thinking. It is, in its essence, a collection of 87 tactics framed within four steps which should help you reclaim your time.
We’ll have a look at some of the tactics in the final one of our “Key Lessons”—but we strongly encourage you to buy this book and try out some other tactics as well. 
Because, as we reveal in our “Summary,” this book is a sort of an encyclopedia for making time for the things that matter. 
So, let’s see 
 and 
 this book works.
Most of Our Time Is Spent by Default
In the chaotic existence that is the twenty-first century, two very powerful forces compete for every minute of your time. 
The first is what the authors call the 
, aka the “culture of constant busyness—the overflowing inboxes, stuffed calendars, and endless to-do lists.”
“According to the Busy Bandwagon mindset,” write Jake and JZ, “if you want to meet the demands of the modern workplace and function in modern society, you must fill every minute with productivity. After all, everyone else is busy. If you slow down, you’ll fall behind and never catch up.”
You know how that feels, don’t you?
The second force is something called 
, i.e., “apps and other sources of endlessly replenishing content,” aka Facebook, YouTube, Google News, Netflix, HBO, Candy Crash, etc.
A simple rule-of-thumb is that if you can pull to refresh and/or if it streams—it’s an Infinity Pool. “This always-available, always-new entertainment,” write Jake and JZ, “is your reward for the exhaustion of constant busyness.”
The questions pose by themselves really: “But is constant busyness really mandatory? Is endless distraction really a reward? Or are we all just stuck on autopilot?”
You already know the answers: no, no, and yes.
In other words, in a world which operates by the rules “react,” “respond,” “fill your time,” “be efficient,” and “get more things done,” it’s only normal that when something is irresistible and at your fingertips, you’re bound to become addicted to it.
It’s not like you want to watch the next YouTube video or that you 
 
 to scroll down to see some newer social posts after doing that for the past five hours; 
.
Fortunately, there is a way out: setting your 
defaults.
Make Time Is Just Four Steps, Repeated Every Day
And this is where 
 comes in.
In the words of its authors:
“
 is a framework for choosing what you want to focus on, building the energy to do it, and breaking the default cycle so that you can start being more intentional about the way you live your life. Even if you don’t completely control your own schedule—and few of us do—you absolutely can control your attention.”
And then they go on:
“With new habits and new mindsets, you can stop reacting to the modern world and start actively making time for the people and activities that matter to you. This isn’t about saving time. It’s about making time for what matters.”
And you can do that in four simple steps which should be repeated daily, and which, in essence, are both sequential and circular: 1. Highlight → 2. Laser ⇄ 3. Energize → 4. Reflect → 1. Highlight…
In short:
• First, you need to 
 to prioritize in your day (there are 16 tactics that can help you with this);
• Then, you need to employ specific tactics (one of 44) to 
;
• Of course, to stay laser-focused on anything, you’ll need 
, and you can do this by using one of the 27 tactics offered and described by Jake and JZ;
• Finally, you’ll 
 to see where the tactics you’ve used brought you.
But let’s learn something more about each of these tactics.
Highlight: Start Each Day by Choosing a Focal Point
As we said above, the first step in the 
 framework is 
. 
Contrary to what the Busy Bandwagon advocates shout around every corner (“Get 
done. Be 
efficient”), Jake and JZ think that doing 
 is what actually makes life worth living.
, however, may seem scary at first: all of the other guys are rushing through life, you might think, and if I do 
, I’m bound to fall behind them.
That’s not true!
Because 
is primarily about doing what you want to do the most—and 
 doing the rest.
So, start every day by asking yourself a simple two-part question:
“If, at the end of the day, someone asks you, ‘What was the highlight of your day?’ what do you want your answer to be?”
Or, to put that in another way, “when you look back on your day, what activity or accomplishment or moment do you want to savor?”
Well, that’s your Highlight, your focal point for the day, 
.
It can be anything, from your 
 through the 
to the 
of your day. But it has to be one, and it has to be the answer to the question: “What do I want to be the highlight of my day?”
To answer this question, use these three criteria:
• 
: What’s the most pressing thing I have to do today?
•
: At the end of the day, which Highlight will bring me the most satisfaction?
• 
: When I reflect on today, what will bring me the most joy?
A good rule of thumb is to 
. And to choose the best one, use one of these seven Highlight Tactics (see the “Key Lessons” section for more):
1. Write It Down
2. Groundhog It (or, “Do Yesterday Again”)
3. Stack Rank Your Life
4. Batch the Little Stuff
5. The Might-Do List
6. The Burner List
7. Run a Personal Sprint
Choosing your Highlight is not enough; you need to make time for it (i.e., prioritize it). And you can do this using any one of these nine tactics:
8. Schedule Your Highlight
9. Block Your Calendar
10. Bulldoze Your Calendar
11. Flake It Till You Make It
12. Just Say No
13. Design Your Day
14. Become a Morning Person
15. Nighttime Is Highlight Time
16. Quit When You’re Done
Laser: Beat Distraction to Make Time for Your Highlight
Now that you’ve chosen and made time for the Highlight of your day—the 
 hard part comes: you need to put all your energy to 
 and really execute the job.
And to focus, you need to go into a peculiar state of mind called Laser:
“When you’re in Laser mode,” write JZ and Jake, “your attention is focused on the present like a laser beam shining on a target. You’re in the flow, fully engaged, and immersed in the moment. When you’re laser-focused on your Highlight, it feels fantastic—it’s the payoff for proactively choosing what’s important to you.”
The problem?
Distraction—the #1 enemy of your Laser Mode of being. Distraction, say the authors, is “like a giant disco ball in the path of your laser beam: Light goes everywhere except in the direction of the target. When that happens, you can easily end up missing out on your Highlight.”
And, of course, distractions (social media, email, breaking news, Netflix, cat GIFs, etc.) are just about everywhere.
For example, Apple reports that people unlock their phones an average of 80 times a day. Moreover, according to a customer-research firm called Dscout, people 
their phones an average of 2,617 times per day.
“Distracted,” conclude JZ and Jake justly, “has become the new default.”
And this is nothing strange—due to at least four reasons:
• The appeal of—and
our
—technology
•
The
of technological products
•
The sheer number of 
on the market
•
Our
There are, fortunately, ways you can change this, and, even more fortunately, they don’t include willpower and discipline (as you know full well, they, alone, don’t help).
Here’s a list of tactics which can help you instead:
17. Try a Distraction-Free Phone
18. Log Out
19. Nix Notifications

48. Shut the Door
49. Invent a Deadline

55. Make a “Random Question” List
56. Notice One Breath
57. Be Bored
58. Be Stuck
59. Take a Day Off
60. Go All In
Energize: Use the Body to Recharge the Brain
“To achieve focus and make time for what matters,” write JZ and Jake, “your brain needs energy, and that energy comes from taking care of your body.”
Even though the lifestyle defaults of the 21
 century make it hard to believe, charging your batteries (whether through exercise, food, sleep, quiet, or face-to-face time) is an all-important part of the human existence.
Sneaking a nap, exercising, learning how to use caffeine strategically—these are all just simple shifts which can get you some energy necessary for you to go both through your day and through your to-do list.
Because what all of those productivity books don’t tell you is one of the simplest truths you’ll ever hear: the modern brain-based lifestyle is 
, and you still have a hunter-gatherer body roaring for health and energy.
Fortunately, it’s not that difficult to change things:
The hunter-gatherers from the past were constantly on his feet, walking, carrying, lifting, and working. Consequently, your brain performs better when in motion. You don’t need to be a bodybuilder or train for a marathon to wake up the caveman inside you: these four tactics should help you recharge your brain batteries just as well:
61. Exercise Every Day (but Don’t Be a Hero)
62. Pound the Pavement
63. Inconvenience Yourself
64. Squeeze in a Super Short Workout
Let’s face it, it’s pretty simple when it comes to food, both with regard to health and energy: eat only what the cavemen could find and catch (fruits, vegetables, animals, nuts) and avoid invented and manufactured foods. Do this with one of these five tactics:
65. Eat Like a Hunter-Gatherer
66. Central Park Your Plate
67. Stay Hungry
68. Snack Like a Toddler
69. Go on the Dark Chocolate Plan
OK, cavemen didn’t really drink coffee, but, as far as caffeine is concerned, we are the ones with the upper hand: caffeine reenergizes quickly and effectively, and, if you use it well, you’re doing a good job.
70. Wake Up Before You Caffeinate
71. Caffeinate Before You Crash
72. Take a Caffeine Nap
73. Maintain Altitude with Green Tea
74. Turbo Your Highlight
75. Learn Your Last Call
76. Disconnect Sugar
In the world of our ancient ancestors, almost nothing ever happened. That’s why 
 and work much less than you: quiet is the norm for them, and the noise of the distractions around you are a disaster for your energy levels. So:
77. Get Woodsy
78. Trick Yourself into Meditating
79. Leave Your Headphones at Home
80. Take Real Breaks
How many Facebook friends do you have? How many of them are your 
 friends? Well, cavemen didn’t have the former: all of their interactions were face-to-face. Kick it old school and charge your batteries by spending some distraction-free time with the people who make you happy. The best shortcut toward happiness:
81. Spend Time with Your Tribe
82. Eat Without Screens
Of course, it’s metaphorical; but that doesn’t make it less true. Start 
 in your bedroom by, well, sleeping. No screens, no schedules, no caffeine, no nothing besides a bed in your bedroom. Well, that’s the first of the five tactics which will help you rest better—and 
rested more:
83. Make Your Bedroom a Bed Room
84. Fake the Sunset
85. Sneak a Nap
86. Don’t Jet-Lag Yourself
87. Put On Your Own Oxygen Mask First
Reflect: Adjust and Improve Your System
Though at first glance somewhat negligible, the final step of the Make Time framework may be the most important—because it’s actually what separates the scientific method from pseudoscientific activities.
Namely, the scientific method consists of no more than four steps:
#1. 
 what’s going on.
#2. 
 why things are happening the way they are.
#3. 
 to test your hypothesis.
#4. 
 the results and decide whether you were right.
Well, that’s what you’ll be doing before going to bed: taking a few notes, and, subsequently, using these notes to decide which tactics you want to continue, which ones you want to refine, and which ones you’d rather drop.
Over time, this kind of behavior will help you build “a customized daily system tailored to your unique habits and routines, your unique brain and body, and your unique goals and priorities.”
Speaking of—

Begin by taking note of all the tactics you want to try. Look for the ones your guts tell you are the best: may they be both doable but a little challenging as well; above all, may they be fun.

 into practice, the authors suggest that you

In other words, choose 
 of the 18 Highlight tactics, 
 which will keep you laser-focused by changing how you react to distractions, and one for building energy; so, that’s

Now that you’ve picked the tactics, 
 them for a few days.
Since the fourth step of the Make Time manual includes reflecting upon results, you’ll know by the end of, say, your third day whether any one of the tactics works. If it does—keep it; if not—modify or switch.
And then—
 the process.
In time, you should be able to combine more tactics within a single step, and even invent new ones through modifications. Each day is a chance to experiment—until you get the perfect version of the Make Time system.
And when we say “perfect,” we mean “perfect

When that happens—throw away the book!

Get Off the Busy Bandwagon (But Stay Out of the Infinity Pools as Well)
In the dynamic world of the 21
 century, two powerful forces compete for every single minute of your waking life: The Busy Bandwagon and the Infinity Pools.
The Busy Bandwagon is this “culture of constant busyness,” and the Infinity Pools are all those “apps and other sources of endlessly replenishing content.”
In more practical terms, the Busy Bandwagon is everything you have on your calendar, and to-do lists and the Infinity Pools are all the distractions that keep you from completing these tasks (Facebook, YouTube, Netflix, etc.)
The Busy Bandwagon says, “get more things done;” the Infinity Pools say “fuhgeddaboudit.” 
Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky (JZ) say that the trick is to listen to neither: you should get 
 things done by 
 
ting about the world happening around you.
That’s what quality of life 
 is.
Make Time Is a Four-Step Framework
In other words, Jake and JZ advise that you need to make time in your day for the things you really want to do. And that’s a four-step process which is both sequential and repetitive:
#1. 
: the process starts with choosing a single activity you’ll prioritize over all others in your calendar, the thing you want to be the answer to the question “What was the highlight of your day?” posed at the end of it;
#2. 
: now that you know the task you want to prioritize, devise tactics to focus on its completion;
#3. 
: move, eat real food, optimize caffeine, and sleep well, to energize your body so that your brain can stay focused for longer periods of time; and, finally:
#4. 
: spend at least ten minutes each night to see what worked and what didn’t so that you can modify or switch tactics the following day.
Quick Start Guide to Make Time
Now, Jake and JZ offer no less than 87 tactics—only some of which may work for you. We’ve listed all of them above, but you don’t need all of them: you just need the ones that will work for you.
To discover them, of course, you’ll need to experiment. And here’s a quick start guide to make time right away (if you’re not sure where to begin):
 
(Tactic #1)
(Tactic #8)
Nothing could be simpler than this: just write down your highlight, decide how much time you need for it, and schedule it on your calendar next to a note “I’m going to do this within this time period, no matter what.”
 (Tactic #24)
Every one of us has a distraction kryptonite: it may be Facebook or lichess.org; either way, “if after spending a few minutes (or, more likely, a few minutes that become an hour) with this website or app you feel regret, it’s probably Kryptonite.” 
Free yourself any way you can from this 
 Infinity Pool, and see how your attention would change.
 (Tactic #62)
We are born to walk and sitting all day does nobody any favors. Fortunately, it’s easy to incorporate walking within your daily schedules: just jump off the bus two stops early or park far away (bonus: you won’t lose time searching for the perfect spot!). “A few minutes of walking each day provides a boost for the body and quiet for the mind.”
Don’t commit to any of the tactics above: try them for three days and take notes. If they don’t work—modify or try another tactic. It’s obvious where we’re going with this, right?

I’ve been a little bit surprised by the title of 
‘s book: 
. My first thought was “wouldn’t be a better title: the end of jobs as we know them”?
After all, there are a lot of factors involved in this discussion and it depends a lot on the type of job that you are performing.
We cannot all become an entrepreneur, that’s for sure. But if you are in doubt and you don’t know if it is the right decision to choose that direction, you are going to love this book.
The basic idea of the book is that

 tries to give us the insights on this issue.
These are phenomena that are not slowing down or stopping: 
Many of the jobs that our grandparents had are now obsolete and the specialists say that by the year 2030, around 50% of the job titles that we have today, will no longer exist.
This is due to technology. What globalization and the internet did, was to create access for young entrepreneurs to cheap resources from all over the world.
You no longer need an office and a staff hired in your country. You can work from home and hire an accountant from India, a web designer from China or a content writer from Russia.
 So what if you don’t make it from the start? You learn your lesson and try again. Just that now your costs are not so high and you are not completely bankrupt:
 gives us an example: two young people with the same studies, same aptitudes, but who chose different paths. One went and got a job at a good company.
He got a mortgage, indulged in some extra expenses because he was sure that at some point he will be promoted.
The other started small as an entrepreneur, many times he hardly

The first one, was substituted with a person working from an underdeveloped country, willing to do the job for a lot less money.
The second guy, had a rough start, but managed to build his own company and was not making a profit. So the conclusion of the story is that:
I think this quote pretty much sums up 
We reached a development point where people if they really want to, are able to design and create their realities and their jobs. You are no longer trapped in a factory, you just need to focus on what you want to achieve and work for it.
The fact that we can find cheaper workforce overseas has its ups and downs. On one hand, 
 with relatively small resources and employ or contract people at very good rates.
But, on the other hand, it could indicate that you are being laid off because the company you work for decided to employ other people capable to do your job, but also prepared to work for far less money:
It is hard even for the new generations to understand and cope with the level of intensity at which technology is developing. Let’s take the sequencing of the human genome.
It took seven years only for a small portion (1%) to be analyzed and segmented and then in only fifteen years, the project was completed. People were not able to make these kinds of predictions.
Once a discovery is made, the progress coming out of it is dramatically increased and people find it hard to keep up with all the information available and the systems created.

The book talks also about 
. More and more young people are willing to work hard and for relatively low pay, just to have access to a great mentor and the know-how of a company.
It’s a trend that can be transformed into a win-win situation. You are aware that this person will not stick with your company for more than 2-3 years, but they could become a potential partner after they go on their own.
The salary is smaller than in the case of a regular employee and they are willing to work very hard.
On the other hand, the young person that is entering an apprenticeship has the opportunity to learn valuable stuff and gain experience without investing his own money and he will have time to create the much-needed relationships:
The internet is really the one to thank when it comes to the freedom of information. Think about all the resources and wisdom nuggets that we have access to.

Development of Alexa Skills Kit for 12min App,https://blog.12min.com/development-of-alexa-skills-kit/,https://blog.12min.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screenshot-765-1024x600.png,"4 min read ⌚ 
Marc Kuban – an American businessman, investor, and a
billionaire at one occasion implied: 
Was he talking about Alexa?
Not particularly, but
it’s clear as to why developing voice assistant skills could be regarded as a thing of the future.
In this article, we’re going to cover why 
 went the
extra mile and decided to implement Alexa and its features.
Let’s dig in:
The Rise of Voice Search Technology
Unlike most other Brands and companies which would rather hire an agency to do the dirty work, 
 decided to launch the development of Alexa Skills Kit and seize upon the set of built-in capabilities provided by Amazon.
What this does, is helping you to code new Alexa experience
relevant to your customer or user-base.
If you are new to all this, allow us to lift the veil on the
Alexa magic.
The Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) is nothing other than a
collection of APIs, coding samples, and various tools that facilitate the
process of expanding your Alexa Kit service. Addressing the problems of your
customers, through Alexa enabled devices could lead to higher engagement and
profits.
But that’s not what this is all about. It might also be construed as a response to the frantic
pace we are currently stuck in.
Then, people with access to your software could ask for
guidance from Alexa as the example below:
– 
Alexa is instructed to assist and provide you with the service
that you’ve requested.
In 2018, Alexa reached new heights with the development of
New Console that you can use to test your Alexa Skills kit.
You have to understand that the Alexa Skills Kit resembles a
selection of voice apps that respond to commands. On you Amazon Echo devices
you can new skills, enable some, disable them, and even ask for
recommendations.
Businesses have unique benefits from developing their Alexa
Kit pool, but they all revolve around the idea of improving customer
experience.
First of all, what are the
benefits of putting Alexa to use?
From a business perspective, you
can expect the following:
Now, how to build it?
There are three paths you are
allowed to take when developing your ASK:
The quickest and easiest way is to
do it, especially if you lack the coding prowess, is to use the blueprint
templates already in place.
Head over to 
Sign up, and start your quest.
Once there, you’ll be given a list of choices:
Pick a template that is associated
with a theme that you would like to exploit.
Next, you’ll land on a page where
you can see the benefits of expanding your ASK and how to maximize the positive
experience.
Click on “Make Your Own” and start
filling in the template with data.
You can put all sorts of things
such as, you babysitter’s name, your name, your baby’s name – what time do you
usually wake up…
The whole idea revolves around one
very simple concept – to customize the
descriptions according to your needs.
Once you’ve created the
experience, give it a name, and the skill will be
automatically connected to all the devices associated with your Amazon
Account. 
Why build one?
Of course, you can use other
methods to create your first Alexa experience, but the question still stands –
Why is it necessary to have this new amazing
voice interface?
The goal behind is to make everyday skills much faster and more
convenient. 
Think about it; it’s like having a partner-in-crime – hypothetically speaking.
You can incentivize your users to look
up for answers, challenge them with puzzles or games, provide audio support,
and more.
The type of skill you would like to
create has to be brought into line with
your overall needs and plans.
For example: if you like your
users to access some of the App’s features more quickly, then you would have to
log in to 

where you need to click on the box that says “Create Skill.”
Next up, you are entitled to
choose a model that will serve as the foundation for your new Alexa Skills Kit.

You live in the most democratic and individualistic age in history. You are freer than any of your ancestors, but are you happy?
David Brooks says: most probably, you are not. And it is precisely because of that freedom.
Let’s follow him in his quest for a moral life, as he climbs:
Who Should Read “The Second Mountain”? And Why?
We’re living in a world where everybody is free to do whatever he/she wants, and yet most of the people say they are unhappy.

That’s why we want to recommend it to anyone who feels lack of fulfillment and lack of joy in his/her life, and especially to those who want to find them in the seemingly unfree communal life of their neighborhoods, cities, towns, or countries.

“The Second Mountain PDF Summary”
Even though divided into five parts, 
is actually a two-part counter-intuitive and possibly even revolutionizing examination of “how we function and conduct our lives.” (
). 
In the first part of the book – titled “Two Mountains” – Brooks offers a theoretical foundation for his belief that individualism is not the path to living a happy and moral life, i.e., is not the mountain you should climb to reach the summit of your existence.
In the second part – which actually consists of four separate parts – he introduces us to the four commitments which, in his opinion, may give some sense and meaning to your (and everybody’s) past, present, and future.
Part I: The Two Mountains
The two mountains from the title of the first part are the mountain of individuality and the mountain of commitment; separated by the valley of suffering, these two represent (in David Brook’s eyes) the two paths you can go by in life and, whether you want that or not, you’ve already taken one of them.
However, as Led Zeppelin sang, in the long run, there’s still time to change the road you’re on. And Brooks says you really should; because, most probably, you’ve been tricked into taking the wrong one.
The First Mountain
The first mountain is the one climbed by most modern people on their journey toward a life of happiness and fulfillment.
It is the mountain of individualism, as championed most fervently in the land of the free and the brave, the United States.
After all, we spent most of the 20
 century waging wars against the world – first the Fascist countries such as 
 and 
, and then against 
 – to defend this exceptional idea: as long as you don’t harm anyone, you should be able to become anything you want to be.
As a result, nowadays, you can – not only in the United States but also in most of Europe and parts of Asia and South America. The US prides itself in this: against the collective identities of the East, we set an agenda of freedom and individuality, and the right side won.
Possibly “the most influential public intellectual in the Western world at the moment,” 
, repeatedly states this: it is, indeed, a story of good vs. evil, and fortunately, the good won.
What was the final result?
Well, let’s just say it was not the one we expected.
“The grand narrative of individual emancipation,” writes David Brooks, “left us with what some have called ‘the great disembedding.’” 
“Whereas before people tended to be enmeshed in tight communities with prescribed social norms that sometimes seemed stifling, now they are cut loose. Whereas once they served in hierarchical institutions, now they have trouble thinking institutionally at all – how to live within an institution, steward an institution, and reform an institution – so the quality of our social organizations that make up our common life decays.”
In other words, individualism didn’t result in a world where everybody is happy; instead, it led both the individuals and our societies as a whole far from the summit of the first mountain and into the valley of suffering and defeat.
“A half century of emancipation has made individualism, which was the heaven for our grandparents, into our hell,” notes Brooks. “It has produced four interrelated social crises.”
People may try to tell you differently, but stats don’t lie.
We should have realized this sooner: individualism leads to loneliness, and loneliness is a debilitating feeling. 
Just check out these numbers:
• 35% of Americans over 45 are chronically lonely;
• No more than 8% of Americans report having important conversations with their neighbors in any given year (i.e., no less than 92% probably don’t!);
• 30% of households are single-person households, as compared to less than 10% in 1950;
• Since 1999, the U.S. suicide rate has risen by 30%: roughly 45,000 Americans kill themselves each year;
• Most stunningly, the life span of the average American has declined for the last three years – the last time this happened, we were fighting in a war; the First World War!
If with individualism comes loneliness, with loneliness comes distrust. As George Eliot wrote almost prophetically in her magnum opus, 
: “What loneliness is more lonely than distrust?” We rely more on ourselves because when there is no connection, we can’t rely on nobody around us.
Back in the 1950s, three-fourths of Americans trusted their government; now, less than one-fourth does. Moreover, roughly 60% of Americans said that their neighbors were trustworthy in the 1950s; now, only half of that do; most frightening: only 18% of millennials!
“Every age group in America is less trusting than the one before,” notes Brooks, “and, as Robert Putnam of Harvard points out, that’s for a very good reason: People are less trustworthy. It’s not that perception is getting worse. It’s actual behavior. The quality of our relationships is worse. Distrust breeds distrust.”
Here’s another problem that comes with individualism: if you’re condemned to be free, 
, you’re also condemned to find your “why” in this world by yourself.
The problem?
“When you take away a common moral order and tell everybody to find their own definition of the mystery of life, most people will come up empty. They will not have a compelling story that explains the meaning of their life in those moments when life gets hard.”
The result?
In 2012, less than 6% of young Americans suffered from severe depression; three years later, that number rose up to 8.2%.
Whether it is Sartre or Peterson, intellectuals who cherish people’s freedom always advise that everyone should write his/her own story; the problem, it seems, is that not everyone is capable of doing that. 
In the meantime, the great narratives of the past have lost all meaning as well: only half of Americans today are proud to be Americans, and only 34% of millennials agree; and just 15 years ago, 70% of Americans were “extremely proud” to live in this country.
“Man has a horror of aloneness,” Balzac wrote in 
. “And of all kinds of aloneness, moral aloneness is the most terrible.”
The three crises above have given rise to a fourth one, “which is not a facet of extreme individualism itself, but our reaction to it.”
“People who are left naked and alone by radical individualism,” reminds us Brooks, “do what their genes and the ancient history of their species tell them to do: They revert to tribe. Individualism, taken too far, leads to tribalism.”
And it’s only natural that such a thing should happen: an individual without a sense of purpose suffers from a severe case of existential dread. So, he slips into crisis mode: “I’m in danger! I’m threatened; I must strike back!”
We are programmed to do whatever we can to protect ourselves when we are left alone; and the easiest way to do this is to disqualify everyone suspicious.  Tribalists seek out easy categories and certainty to conquer their feelings of unbearable doubt. They seek out war – political war or actual war – as a way to give life meaning. They revert to tribe:
 noted that he who has a “why” to live can endure any “how.” And Viktor Frankl witnessed this firsthand in Germany’s concentration camps: 
.” 
In a world of radical individuality, it is more than idealistic to expect that all people will be able to find a “why;” it is, in fact, irrational and impossible: if two “whys” contradict each other, either one person will end up without it, or a conflict will inevitably erupt, the very thing we tried to axiomatically stop from the beginning (“
”).
Yup, David Brooks is going where you never expected he would: freedom is overrated and is the wrong foundation to build human societies on.
In the dizziness of freedom, he writes poetically, “nobody quite knows where they stand with one another. Everybody is pretty sure that other people are doing life better. Comparison is the robber of joy.”
Don’t get him wrong: Brooks is no fool to say that all freedom is wrong; but he does think that only one of them (
) makes sense:
The Second Mountain
Instead of living the committed purpose-driven life of togetherness, most of us are living the unfulfilling and detached Instagram life of loneliness.
This is something David Foster Wallace already warned us in 
“Learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed.”
As we’ve implied above, Wallace’s remedy is unrealistic; and you don’t even need to go further than yourself to realize this:“when you are in your distraction,” reminds you Brooks, “untethered to actual commitments, focusing your attention is precisely what you cannot do. Your mind is afloat and at the play of prompts.”
In other words, most of us are neither brave enough nor capable enough to write our own stories and find some overall direction for our lives. In a world of distractions, our minds constantly “wander from the meaty big questions, which are completely daunting and unanswerable, to the diverting candy right on your phone – the tiny dopamine lift.”
“All of this, points in one direction,” concludes Brooks, “into the ditch. The person who graduates from school and pursues an aesthetic pattern of life often ends up in the ditch. It’s only then that they realize the truth that somehow nobody told them: Freedom sucks.”
There’s an even deeper reason – yes, deeper than all those numbers and stats above – why should freedom suck.
Because, in a way, its very nature is – after a certain point – incompatible not only with the nature of meaning and morality (the goals of the climber of the second mountain) but also with the nature of happiness itself (the shallow objective of first mountain climbers).
Why is that?
Simply put, because we can’t be happy in solitude; it doesn’t matter if one runs the 100 meters under 9.58 if he doesn’t know how fast someone else has run the same difference. It matters even less even when he does, but nobody has heard of his own achievement.
And it goes even beyond that: as many people have shown
. When someone has too much, nobody can be happy even if he/she has a lot.
Abundance? Affluence? Yes – but for whom? 
. If anything, we’re moving in the opposite direction, making the world a better place for fewer and fewer people.
The trickle-down effect means nothing in view of the notion that happiness is relational; and it means even less if you realize that happiness is fleeting as well.
Should the goal of one be something as temporary as human happiness? Will he/she ever achieve fulfillment? 
The answer to the question above is a resounding “no.” 
Which is why we need to waste no more time and start climbing the second mountain – the mountain of commitments.
“The person beginning the second mountain climb wages a silent rebellion against the ‘I’m Free to Be Myself’ culture that is still the defining feature of our age,” writes Brooks. “That individualistic culture… was itself a rebellion against the stifling conformity of the 1950s. The second-mountain ethos is a rebellion against that rebellion.”
And what kind of an ethos is this?
Well, instead of “Shoot for personal happiness and celebrate independence,” the motto of the second-mountain climbers is “Shoot for meaning and moral joy and celebrate interdependence.” The former want to be autonomous and speak with an active voice: lecturing, taking charge; the latter praise relations and seek to listen and respond:
Parts II-V: The Four Commitments
“Most of us make four big commitments over the course of our lives: to a vocation, to a spouse and family, to a philosophy or faith, and to a community,” writes David Brooks. And since the second mountain is the mountain of commitment, it is through a deep understanding of these four commitments that you can reach its summit.
Part II: Vocation
In 1946, George Orwell published an essay titled “Why I Write” in which he laid down for reasons to explain his decision to dedicate his life to writing novels and essays:
#1. 
: “the desire to seem clever and to get talked about;”
#2. 
: “the pleasure he gets from playing with sentences and words;”
#3. 
 
: “the desire to see things as they are and find out true facts.
#4. 
: “the desire to push the world in a certain direction, and to alter people’s ideas of what sort of society they should strive for.”
What happens when two of these reasons collide?
Well, if you are Orwell, and you have committed yourself truly and fully to your vocation, the only thing that can happen: the higher ideal wins out. 
That’s why, even though he was a Democratic Socialist, Orwell was nothing if not honest 
.
What gave him this integrity?
The commitment, the narrative he decided to write for himself.
Choosing a vocation is much like choosing a marriage partner: there are almost always more than just a few options, but, at a certain point, you’ll have to settle for one.
But that’s not a bad thing: otherwise, you’ll become what the Elizabethans referred to as 
, aka “Jack of all trades…” Well, you know the rest of that phrase.
Individualism gave birth to people like William Randolph Hearst, the tabloids, reality TV: in order to remain unique, everyone will do anything, even lie about himself.
Committing to something doesn’t work that way.
It usually means asking yourself the question “how can I be of 
to my field of choice?” and not “how can it be of service to me?”
Part III: Marriage
Just like choosing a vocation, choosing a spouse asks for commitment. 
Evolutionary, you are not built to live in a monogamous relationship; and no matter what every single pop group has sung for the past century, love is not for all times and is certainly not just a feeling; it is a scope of actions and rituals, a structure of behaviors.
Individualism has resulted in the destruction of the nuclear family for a reason: when you put yourself first, no relationships are possible.
Consequently, it is almost impossible to cancel the meeting with your boss and risk climbing the corporate ladder for a date with your spouse.
But, as team sports have taught us, sometimes taking one for the team is the only way to achieve victory.
In the long run, of course.
Part IV: Philosophy and Faith
: participating in a spiritual community – even if secular.
We don’t know why it lengthens life, but we can guess: people who believe in something together have a more profound “why” than people who believe in something alone.
This should surprise nobody: after all, we are animals, and as Aristotle knew, social animals as well; just like you wouldn’t expect from an ant to thrive if separated from its community, you shouldn’t expect that from a human being as well.
Not that we can’t survive or even live a reasonably happy life; but we need to do it through an enormous amount of willpower and conviction – something which most of us lack.
Faith – and religious communities – provides “a structure of behaviors” which deal with all of your problems in your stead. It is more difficult to do the latter to start with. Bur more importantly, even when it is very difficult to do the first (fasting, going to church/synagogue/mosque), there’s a sense of reward at the end of the road.
Rituals and vivid religious imagery help people live better and more fulfilled lives – not the least because they share both of them with other people.
Part V: Community
But what if you are not a religious person? Can you participate in the revival of your community?
Of course you can!
The trick is quite simple: just like in the case of choosing a vocation, a partner, or a religion, you need to put the needs of your community above your needs. 
There is something small and petty when you do the latter – even if you become Steve Jobs, in the end, numerous people would still point out the fact that you did so because you didn’t care about the feelings of those around you.
There is something grand and beautiful in putting the needs of your community first: even if you fail, there’s a good chance that you’d feel fulfilled and most people will talk only kind words of you and your existence.
That’s exactly what many people are doing at this very moment worldwide. And the unit of change isn’t the world, or the country or even the town: it is your neighborhood.
Take the matters of the other people in your hands and do something. The communities of the world – and especially the community of the United States – are falling apart.
And just like Kennedy said half a century ago: they need you to do something for them.
Key Lessons from “The Second Mountain”
1.      There Are Two Mountains You Can Climb in Life
2.      Climbing the First Mountain Usually Ends with a Plunge into the Valley of Suffering
3.      Choosing a Life of Commitments Means Choosing a Better Future for Everybody
There Are Two Mountains You Can Climb in Life
The main metaphor of David Brooks’ book is the metaphor of the two mountains, separated by the Valley of Suffering.
The first mountain is the mountain of individual freedom: it is the mountain of autonomy and action, of personal happiness and independence.
The second mountain, on the other hand, is the mountain of commitment: it is the mountain of moral joy and meaning, the mountain of giving and interdependence. 
Climbing the First Mountain Usually Ends with a Plunge into the Valley of Suffering
Contrary to what almost everybody in the Western Hemisphere says for the last century, David Brooks claims that climbing the first mountain is not only an individualistic but also a lonely endeavor which almost never leads to its summit.
On the contrary, it ends with a plunge into the valley of suffering, as a result of the “neither here nor there” liquidity of absolute freedom. 
People, namely, are unable to find meaning in their lives and, in the absence of that “why,” they choose short-term pleasures instead of long-term commitments over and over again.
They are leading Instagram lives, lives of real or virtual experiences, lives that are so much empty and bereaved of meaning that, in 45,000 cases a year in the USA only, they lead to suicide.
Choosing a Life of Commitments Means Choosing a Better Future for Everybody
The better way is the way of the second mountain. 
Because, Brooks says, freedom sucks, and it only makes sense if it is a river to pass through and start climbing this second mountain; when it is an ocean, it does nobody any favor.
The only freedom which makes sense is the one which allows you to make any choice you like at a 
 point in life; the only life which is worth living is the one in which you make certain choices and then stick to them.
Whether it is a vocation, a marriage partner, a religion, or a community – the narrative is the same: you say “yes” to something, and “no” to everything else.
And you stride forward – waving the banner of the communal future above your head, carrying it to the summit of the second mountain.

“The Right Side of History PDF Summary”
Introduction
“This book is about two mysteries,” says Ben Shapiro in the “Introduction” to 
, and
straight off the bat, lists them: “The first mystery: Why are things so good? The second mystery: Why are we blowing it?”
Regarding the first question, you already know the main facts: fewer people are dying, most babies can survive and live up to 80, fewer people than ever are hungry and uneducated.
In short, “we don’t live in a perfect world, but we do live in the best world that has ever existed” (
). Most of Ben Shapiro’s book attempts to understand how did this all happen.
The other part—the more political one, perhaps—is concerned with the question: “Why are we throwing it away?”
There have never been more depressed people in history, we are killing ourselves at the highest rates ever, facts have made way for feelings, 
—to name just a few of the banes of our present-day world.
What in the world happened?
There are four main theories: heightened economic divides, reopening of racial wounds, technologically created filter bubbles and tunnel visions, and/or, for whatever reason, human nature has kicked back in.
Shapiro believes that neither of these theories explains away enough because all of them are offered independent of the first question: how did our world come to be.
“I believe these two questions are intimately related,” he writes. “This book argues that Western civilization, including our modern notions of values and reason and science, was built on deep foundations. And this book argues that we’re tossing away what’s best about our civilization because we’ve forgotten that those foundations even exist.”
Chapter 1: The Pursuit of Happiness
In the 
, Aristotle noted that happiness is the only thing that humans desire for their own sake. In other words, even when people want honor, money, health, friendship, or romantic love—they want it so that they can be happy.
And, in a way, nobody has ever disagreed: according to most philosophers, happiness is the ultimate objective of every human being.
There’s a problem with that sentence, however!
Namely, just like the word “silly”—which originally meant 
—the word “happiness” itself has lost the meaning it had for Aristotle and the Ancient Civilizations. For us, happiness is basically akin to pleasure: golf, fishing, playing with your children, sex—these are all things that make you happy.
But, for many people, so do drinking, drugs, infidelity—to name just a few of the least amoral activities.
Well, Aristotle didn’t confuse happiness with pleasure. For him, a happy person was a person who has fulfilled its moral purpose, i.e., a good person.
Think of it this way: a watch is good if it shows the right time to the second; if it doesn’t, then it’s broken. According to Aristotle, the same holds true for men, as well.
Solomon agrees: “There is nothing better for a person than to rejoice in his work because that is his lot.” (Ecclesiastes 3:22)
And—as we’ve noted many times—so does Viktor Frankl, who wrote in 
: 
“Woe to him who saw no more sense in his life, no aim, no purpose, and therefore no point in carrying on. He was soon lost… We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that 
.”
Chapter 2: From the Mountaintop
“The revelation at Sinai, in approximately 1313 BCE according to traditional Biblical belief, changed the world by infusing it with meaning for those who knew the story,” writes Ben Shapiro.
In other words, before Moses discovered God, humans were a plaything of the gods and of nature; afterward, suddenly, humans were granted both individual and communal purpose.
Judaism did this through four faith-based claims which Shapiro says were “utterly different from the pagan religions before”:
#1. God is unified, and there is a master plan behind everything;
#2. Human beings are judged by moral, and not utilitarian standards (i.e., even if some things don’t benefit you on earth, they might after you die); 
#3. History progresses, and man has a responsibility to pursue God through all times and circumstances;
#4. God has endowed man with a free will, and therefore human choices matter.
Christianity took the messages of Judaism and broadened these four tenets. However, even though it focused more heavily on grace, it successfully spread these four fundamental principles of Judaism to billions of human beings across the planet.
And that made all the difference, according to Shapiro.
Which is why, he thinks, doing away with religion is synonymous with doing away with the things we call “Western values.”
Judeo-Christian religion is not antirational or backward—it is the prerogative to progress and the very existence of Western societies; true enlightenment, 
, doesn’t rest on the destruction of the Judeo-Christian heritage; it 
 the Judeo-Christian heritage.
Chapter 3: From the Dust
The Bible gave humanity a God, an objective to strive for; the Greeks made humans Gods, turning the understanding of the true nature of God—Nature—into an objective.
The classical roots of Western civilization in Athens still have much to teach us,” says Shapiro. “Athens teaches us what we are capable of doing as human beings. Athens teaches us that we have the ability to use our reason to reach beyond ourselves. Athens teaches us not only how liberty can flourish, but why it should.”
In Chapter 2, we saw that without Jerusalem, there could be no West; without Athens, adds Shapiro, the same holds true.
And it’s easy to see why: the Greeks were the first to truly understand the capacity of our brains and the fact that our brains are really what sets us apart from the animals. Consequently, they were the first to attempt to formulate the laws of the universe, believing it to be created by all-knowing Gods.
In a way, the Greeks didn’t believe—like the Hebrews—that God is imperceptible; on the contrary, they attempted to understand how his mind worked when he created the universe.
This thinking gave as many benefits: geography, history, mathematics, and, perhaps, most important of all, democracy. 
In Athens, for the first time in history, people started thinking of political systems which would allow everybody a vote.
Chapter 4: Coming Together
“The worlds of Jerusalem and Athens seemed largely irreconcilable,” writes Shapiro at the beginning of the fourth chapter.
“Judaism was a small but important religion—estimates suggest that perhaps 10 percent of the Roman Empire was Jewish by the end of the first century CE—and Greek thought had largely been subsumed within the rubric of Roman thought. But the two building blocks of Western civilization, Judaic revelation and Greek reasoning, were at war.”
There were three serious conflicts between Jewish thought and Greek thought:
“Where Judaism posited an active God in the universe,” writes Shapiro, “Greek thought posited an Unmoved Mover largely unconcerned with human affairs.”
God stood behind creation in both cases; but unlike Greek reason, Judaism also saw God’s presence in human events, not merely nature. 
For Judaists, God was intimately involved with man’s action; for the Greeks, fate explained much more than “divine presence with a moral sense.”
As we said above, the Greeks sought universality in all things—and they firmly believed that they were capable of finding it. 
Judaism, on the other hand, set a limit on human capacity: it believed that there are some truths known only to God, and these can be communicated to humans only through revelations.
Finally, the Greeks were committed to the polis; the Jewish to the divine.
In other words, the Greeks wanted to shape individuals to best serve society as citizens; Judaism wanted to commit them both individually and collectively to the Divine Law.
Apparently irreconcilable, Judaism and Greek thought were brought together and found some consonance in Christianity, which provided the next layer of foundational ideas in the building of modernity.
Chapter 5: Endowed by Their Creators
Now, contrary to what you believe—and what the four riders of the modern atheistic movement would have you believe—Christianity and science worked pretty well together for long stretches of time:
To mention just a few examples: 
• Nicole Oresme (1320–1382), bishop of Lisieux and the discoverer of the Earth’s rotation about its axis;
• Nicholas of Cusa (1401–1464), cardinal of Brixen who first theorized that the Earth was not stationary, but moved through space.
• Finally, Nicolaus Copernicus whose 
 included a letter to Pope Paul III.
The problem actually arose because of Martin Luther and John Calvin, after which the Church became suspicious of where the inclusion of secular knowledge would lead to.
That’s why it persecuted Galileo, who, despite this, didn’t lose his faith; on the contrary, he believed that it was his religious duty to find God through science.
“Galileo was no exception,” notes Shapiro. “He was a representative of the rule: religious men saw a duty to examine the universe, and to do so with the best possible methodology. This philosophy permeated the wisdom of the Enlightenment’s greatest scientists.”
(Yup, that’s another jab at Pinker; the blows become ever more visible throughout the book until he is called out by name.)
Another deeply religious Christian mentioned in this chapter is John Locke, the man who basically invented modern freedom.
Locke believed that our rights are a corollary of our duties: we have 
 since we have a corresponding duty not to steal; 
, since we have a duty not to kill; and 
 since we have a duty not to oppress.
Governments’ only job was to protect these rights; if it doesn’t, he argued, the citizens have the right to overthrow it.
Chapter 6: Killing Purpose, Killing Capacity
As you probably know, John Locke is one of the heroes of the Enlightenment, a period of history which modern proponents of progress (read: Steven Pinker et al.) think of as the pinnacle of civilization and Western values.
This was the period, they say when humanity finally got rid of the Baconian idols of the cave and started seeing the world as it is. Locke, Spinoza, Hume, Voltaire, Kant—they all thought the way a human being should think, i.e., bereaved of the burden of a God, and aware that everything’s been done via humankind’s very own mental capacities and abilities.
Furthermore, these advocates of Enlightenment values argue, it is religion which prevents us from making another step forward.
According to Shapiro, “these claims are manifestly false.” Even more, he says: we can learn from history that whenever we’ve tried to build a society on reason only, we’ve failed—and miserably, to say the least. 
People like 
, 
, and Spinoza started questioning (parts of) the Judeo-Christian narrative, and this gave birth to moral relativism, culminating in David Hume’s philosophy.
This, finally, resulted in the (at least) nominally atheistic (and, oftentimes, hedonistic) philosophies of Voltaire, Kant, and Bentham who assumed that reason could construct morality from scratch. 
But the very fact that their moralities did not coincide should be evidence in favor of the opposite. Shapiro goes even further: “practically speaking, their morality lifted elements, even if unconsciously, from the Judeo-Christian tradition and Greek telos they suggested they had exploded.”
Speaking of explosions—
, advocating for a world where humans live in accordance with the will of self-perfection.
Of course, there was Dostoyevsky warning that 
—but nobody listened.
And then this happened.
Chapter 7: The Remaking of the World
The idea that we can all be reasonable and supplant traditional Judeo-Christian ideas with things like tolerance and compassion is a vestige of the Enlightenment mentality.
Unfortunately, this idea ignores the dark side of the Enlightenment hope: the French and the Communist Revolutions. (We’re not even going to talk about the Nazis—you know that part too well.)
The Enlightenment, in Shapiro’s 
, had two strains: one based on Athens and Jerusalem, the other bereft of them. 
The first one is the American Enlightenment, “based on the consummation of a long history of thought stretching back to Athens and Jerusalem, down through Great Britain and the Glorious Revolution, and to the New World.”
The second one was the European Enlightenment, “which rejected Athens and Jerusalem in order to build new worlds beyond discoverable purpose and divine revelation.”
In practice:
In the Declaration of Independence (founded upon the philosophy of Aristotle, Cicero, Locke, Sidney, etc.), the rights of man are given to him by God. 
The French Declaration, on the other hand, made no mention of a transcendental presence: “The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation. No body nor individual may exercise any authority which does not proceed directly from the nation.”
The result?
The Home of the Brave and the Land of the Free in the first case; the guillotine and 250,000 dead in the latter one.
That’s godless reasoning for you, right there!
Well, you know this story quite well.
It starts with Karl Marx embracing the values of the French Revolution: “The gigantic broom of the French Revolution… swept away all these relics…  thus, clearly simultaneously the social soil of its last hindrances to the superstructure of the modern state edifice.”
According to Marx, even though the French Revolution didn’t end in a communist utopia, it was the first step toward the gradual evolution of markets toward communism.
One of the obstacles toward the realization of this evolution was religion: “The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is a demand for their true happiness,” he wrote in the 
.
Vladimir Lenin embraced Marx’s beliefs and in 1917, created the first socialist country in the world, which, in his words, was supposed to be the first 
 democratic state. 
“Sounding a lot like Bernie Sanders,” Shapiro informs us, “Lenin wrote in 1917, ‘Democracy for an insignificant minority, democracy for the rich—that is the democracy of capitalist society.”
Lenin’s democracy, however—the democracy for the majority of the people—had to come at a cost. 
Grigory Zinoviev, for example, one of the original members of the Politburo (later to be executed by Stalin), bragged about the launch of the so-called Red Terror: “We must carry along with us 90 million out of the 100 million of Soviet Russia’s inhabitants. As for the rest, we have nothing to say to them. They must be annihilated.”
A death sentence on 10 million human beings; just like that.
?
Chapter 8: After the Fire
In Chapter 7, Shapiro writes this important paragraph:
If you’ve read the quoted paragraph more carefully, you’ve already realized that, in the eyes of Shapiro, there’s basically no difference between what happened in Germany (romantic nationalism), the Soviet Union (collective redistributionism) and Revolutionary France (scientific progressivism).
Their philosophies all made the same mistake: they put the collective before the individual.
And after the fire, after everything was said and done, Jean-Paul Sartre (inspired by Soren Kierkegaard) tried to fill the gaping “meaning-shaped hole” in an entirely new way: with the individual.
Writing n 
, Sartre notes that humans are alone in a chaotic, meaningless world and, thus, are both condemned to be free and responsible for 
 they do.
Greek philosophy and Judaist religious thought believed that man, like a clock, has a clear predefined purpose. For Sartre, however, man is the very opposite of a clock: no definition of man precedes his/her existence.
In other words, we define ourselves through our actions.
Of course, without a guidepost and communal responsibility, this didn’t work either.
And soon, the Neo-Enlightenment was born, which, once again, reverted to the European Enlightenment’s views.
We’ve tried scientific progressivism, Pinker, says Shapiro; it didn’t work.
Chapter 9: The Return to Paganism
Correct us if we’re wrong, but just like 
, Ben Shapiro thinks that many of the PC-related things that are happening today are the result of the reemergence of Marxism under the guise of postmodern beliefs and thoughts. 
He doesn’t really mention the phrase “Cultural Marxism,” but he 
 think that the “Judeo-Christian-supported Enlightenment system” was questioned, on false grounds, by the Frankfurt School of Thought, the members of which (Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse, Fromm, etc.) deliberately misread the nature of American individualism in an attempt to institute some social change.
He even goes further: after quoting Horkheimer’s definition of “critical theory,” Shapiro writes “it is no coincidence that various forms of university study dedicated to various alleged victim groups—black studies, Jewish studies, LGBT studies—all find a home under the ‘critical studies’ rubric.”
(An important disclaimer for our readers: 
, which anyone who has 
read the books of these people would probably already know: for a start, the Frankfurt School of Thought critiqued both capitalism and Marxism.)
Anyway, you know where this is going: Shapiro firmly believes that these thinkers have questioned the foundations of Western society, just like all those people analyzed in chapters 6 and 7.
After intersectionality, victimhood has triumphed, and that spells the end of progress.
The vision of the Left for a better world, instead, provided polarization and solipsism and “carved off individuals into racial groups, then pitted them against one another.” It is this that gave birth to the “execrable” alt-right movements and the tribal mentality of the world today.
“Our only alternative,” concludes Shapiro, “would be to return to the Judeo-Christian values and Greek reason that undergirded America’s founding.”
Conclusion: How to Build
In the conclusion of 
, Ben Shapiro suggests that it is through our children that we need to start returning to these values.
So, what do we teach our children? 
“When I look at my four-year-old daughter and two-year-old son,” Shapiro asks, “what do I want them to know—what 
 they know to become defenders of the only civilization worth fighting for?”
No more than four simple lessons:
 
“Life is not a bewildering, chaotic mess. It’s a struggle, but it’s a struggle 
 
.”
“You were given the ability to choose your path in life—and you were born into the freest civilization in the history of mankind. Make the most of it. You are not a victim. In a free society, you are responsible for your actions.”
“The freedom you enjoy, and morals in which you believe, are products of a unique civilization—the civilization of Dante and Shakespeare, the civilization of Bach and Beethoven, the civilization of the Bible and Aristotle.”
“We are not enemies if we share a common cause. And our common cause is a civilization replete with purpose, both communal and individual, a civilization that celebrates both individual and communal capacity.”

Judaic Revelation and Greek Reasoning Are the Building Blocks of Western Civilization
Before the advent of Judaism, people were nothing more but playthings of the gods, i.e., slaves of fate. The Bible offered them a new world, one enriched with meaning: there is a master plan, it says, and the One who has devised it, will reward the ones who follow it—even if this doesn’t happen on Earth.
Meanwhile, the Greeks devised an interesting idea of their own. They realized that this omniscient and omnipotent Being must have used some laws to create the world and that these laws can be deduced from careful observation of the world.
When these two seemingly irreconcilable views of existence came together and meshed through the rise of Christianity—the Western civilization was born.
Jerusalem and Athens Go Hand in Hand: If One is Missing, Disaster Happens
It is important to note that in every society which thrived, Greek Reason and Judaic Revelation went hand in hand; those which opted for one of the two failed miserably.
For example, the European Enlightenment abhorred religion and glorified reason—but the French Revolution it gave birth to was a disaster. Nazis and Communists did pretty much the same, but their supposedly utopian societies collapsed in just a few decades.
On the other hand, the Americans embraced both Jerusalem and Athens—and built the United States, the greatest and most powerful nation still.
The New Left and the Neo-Enlightenment Threaten to Destroy the Western World
Unfortunately, quite a few New Left and Neo-Enlightenment thinkers believe that it is time that the Western World makes way for something new.
Ben Shapiro says that their 
is, in fact, pretty old and already seen in the cases of the French Revolution and the USSR.
Religious narratives give meaning, and, without it, it’s every man to himself; except, of course, those who are in power and who can wreak havoc upon everybody.

Who Should Read “Problem Solving 101”? And Why?
Everyone has problems; and everyone wants to solve them.
Consequently, everyone needs to learn techniques to solve his/her problems; especially if these are proven to work and are as neatly described and explained as in Ken Watanabe’s 
.
A great book for both kids and adults, realists and dreamers, students and business owners, followers and leaders.
Problem Solving 101 Summary
We all have to make decisions. 
And that is true regardless of who you are: a kid, a student, a businessman or the President of the United States. 
The only thing that varies is the type of the problem.
For some, it is how to pass a math class, for others a decision on where to live, and for yet a third person devising a plan on how to improve his/her company’s bottom line; or, maybe, simply you want to lose some weight or get better at golf.
Now, whether the issue is big or small, says Ken Watanabe in 
, “there’s a fundamental approach to solving these real-life problems, one that can consistently lead you to effective and satisfying solutions.”
If you need that sentence rephrased, here it is: problem-solving is a skill, and just like riding a bike – 
be learned.
And that’s exactly what this book is all about.
Originally written for Japanese schoolchildren, 
quickly gained popularity far beyond its target group, becoming not only Japan’s number one business best-seller in 2007 but also an international hit.
Hence, the English edition and its subtitle: “a simple book for smart people.”
The Case Studies
not only introduces its readers to the basics of the problem-solving approach, but it also offers “a full toolbox of proven problem-solving techniques, the same techniques used by successful problem-solving people and companies all over the world.”
To illustrate how the steps work in practice, Watanabe uses three case studies:
• The Mushroom Lovers, a new band trying to improve their concert attendance numbers;
• John Octopus, a bright young man with aspirations of becoming a computer graphics animator who needs to buy his first computer;
• Kiwi, an aspiring soccer player looking for the best training school in Brazil.
Now, we don’t have enough space in our summary to go over each of these case studies, so we genuinely advise you to buy the book as soon as possible and read them in their entirety. Coupled with some quirky illustrations and an abundance of graphics, 
is really a joy to read, own and share.
But, back to our job.
The Four Steps of Problem Solving
In its essence, problem-solving is a process that can be broken down into four steps: (1) understand the current situation; (2) identify the root cause of the problem; (3) develop an effective action plan; and (4) execute until the problem is solved, making modifications as necessary.
“These steps come as a package,” warns Watanabe, before he goes on to clarify:
“Before you can solve anything, you first need to realize that there’s a problem. Once you do, identifying the root cause of the problem isn’t enough. You have to think through how you could fix the problem, and then actually take the actions required to fix it.”
“Problem solving is a combination of thinking and acting,” he concludes. “Just doing one or the other won’t get you anywhere.”
So, let’s have a look at each of the four steps of problem-solving in full.
The first step of solving a problem is understanding it; though it sounds simple – and, in a way, it 
simple – it is actually something most people do wrong (“The catch is that we often don’t do what seems simple and obvious,” writes Watanabe.)
So, let’s just say that you are a soccer player who wants to improve your soccer skills; you spend more and more time on the field to do that and, in the meantime, your math grades decline.
If you (like 99% of the people) simply say “I have to quit the soccer team, so I have more time to study math,” you haven’t really understood the situation.
As a consequence, there’s a good chance that even after this drastic action, your math grades would remain bad. 
Why?
Because to understand the situation, you need to go much deeper than this. 
Do other kids play soccer as well? Are their grades as bad as yours? If not – i.e., if there are at least a few kids who train with you and whose grades haven’t deteriorated – then is soccer really the problem?
Which brings us to step #2: identifying the root cause of the problem. Of course, to do that, you first need to list all the possible problems.
Let’s simplify the problem by eliminating soccer practice from the equation; or let’s just say that you don’t want to give up soccer or that your math grades have been bad from the start. 
To identify the root cause of your problem, you need to break down the problem to its elementary parts. A good way to do this is by asking yourself the simple question: ““What types of math problems am I getting wrong?”
Now, it’s time to break the questions into categories – like algebra, fractions, and geometry – and compare the scores between categories.
Who knows what you’ll discover now?
It could be that your scores in fractions and algebra are flat, but it is your geometry scores that are giving the impression that math is not your cup of tea. In other words,
just looking at the average trend of the math grades as a whole won’t help you see what is really happening.
This will because you can break down the categories even further, going from geometry problems to problems with area and volume.
Do this until you reach the atomic parts of your problem. 
And then move on to the next step.
The first two steps of the problem-solving approach will take you from “My math grades are going down, and I should quit soccer and study more math” to “My math grades are going down because I am not doing well in three topics: trapezoid area, cylinder volume, and Pythagorean theorem application.”
Needless to say, this latter formulation makes all the difference. Now, you are ready to develop an effective action plan, the result of which will be significantly different.
Because once you identify the root cause of the problem, the solution writes itself. “I need to study more math” is not an action plan; however, I need to revise the lessons about cylinder volume on Monday and solve a few Pythagorean theorem equations on Tuesday is.
As you can see, in this second-case scenario, you’ll know not only what to study, but how much time you’ll need to study it.
Suddenly, it becomes more than clear that soccer practice was never really the problem.
But the problem-solving process doesn’t end there; of course, once you devise an action plan, it’s only natural that you need to start executing it.
Would you just start waking up half an hour earlier or go to sleep half an hour later every day to practice the types of problems pointed above? 
It’s up to you!
But once you start doing that, you’ll start seeing the results of your action plan as well.
And you know what?
They may not mean better grades.
This calls for modifications: maybe half an hour is not enough; or maybe you need some help from your parents, your teacher, or your friends; modify as necessary until you have something to work with.
And when you don’t have that anymore – start the process once again from Step #1.
Maybe you didn’t understand the situation well enough; even more probably, you may have not guessed the root cause of your problems. Maybe it wasn’t a string of geometry problems, but your inability to understand abstract concepts; or maybe it was your outdated or complex textbook.
But you know what?
After you’ve gone through the problem-solving process once, the second time you’re less likely to make a mistake – both with your identification and, consequently, your action plan.
Problem-Solving Tool Box
To ease your way around the problem-solving process, Ken Watanabe offers a toolbox of problem-solving methods which can help you identify the root cause of your problems and/or devise an appropriate and efficient action plan to eliminate it.
Watanabe defines a logic tree as “a visual tool that helps when you are trying to identify all the potential root causes of a problem and generate a wide variety of solutions.”
And it is exactly what you think it is: a branched-out tree which helps you visualize the subclasses – 
 – of your main problem.
Why should you do that?
Because, 
, language is not precise enough; also, it prevents you from seeing the whole image.
You already know how a logic tree looks like, but just to remind you: the trunk of math is branched into algebra, fractions, and geometry, the branch of geometry further into the branches of area and volume, and the branch of volume into cylinder volume, etc. etc.
Now, go make one for 
 problem!
A yes/no tree is basically a specific kind of a logic tree.
“A yes/no tree,” writes Watanabe, “groups people or objects into buckets based on the answers to yes/no questions. By assigning everyone and everything involved to a bucket, you can more clearly see what the core issue is.”
By creating a yes/no tree, you structure the problem into all of its possible outcomes and generate a complete overview.
And that makes things 
 easier.
The logic tree and the yes/no tree should help you a lot to understand your situation and identify all of the probable causes for your problems.
However, in order to identify your root cause and devise an action plan, you need to use the third device in Ken Watanabe’s magical toolbox: problem-solving design plan.
It is basically a table with five columns.
In the first you list all of the possible issues; in the second one, your hypothesis as to why these issues exist; in the third column insert a rationale for each issue; the fourth column is reserved for analysis/activities; the fifth one is optional: here you can put an information source (like a survey or an interview).
With a problem-solving design plan, you’ll spend less time 
, and more time 
things.
“The hypothesis pyramid is a great tool for structuring your argument,” writes Watanabe. 
“Using it to clarify your conclusion and rationale before diving into data collection and analysis will improve your productivity dramatically. It’s also useful for communicating your hypothesis to others.”
 The basic structure of a hypothesis pyramid is simple.
It places the conclusion/main message at the top and lists all the supporting rationales below, like the supporting bricks of a pyramid.
It’s basically each of the rows in a problem-design solving plan broken down further.
There are two tools that are very helpful when you need to evaluate multiple options and select the best one.
The first one is 
: the pros and cons list.
To make one, you just need to follow these four simple steps:
#1. List all the options.
#2. List the pros and cons of each of the options.
#3. Weight each of the positive and negative points you listed. (Put, say, three pluses if it is a very attractive pro, and three minuses if it is very unattractive; and distribute the pros and cons between these two extremes; you can use a five-star rating as well, or a grading system from 0 to 5).
#4. Select the most attractive option.
You can use the criteria and emulation tool “to clarify which criteria, or qualifications, you should use to evaluate your options, decide the importance of each set of criteria, and effectively evaluate your options.”
The steps are:
#1. List all the options.
#2. List the evaluation criteria. (For example, if you’re a soccer player choosing a school: a) quality of education; b) strength of the soccer team; c) distance to school; d) friends, etc.)
#3. Decide the degree of importance of each criterion. (Use three levels: from low to high).
#4. Evaluate each option based on the weighted criteria. (See #3 above.)
#5. Select the most attractive option.

Problem Solving Is a Skill – and It Can Be Learned
“Problem solving isn’t a talent limited to the lucky few,” writes Ken Watanabe at the beginning of the book’s first chapter. “It’s actually a skill and a habit that you can learn.”
If your question is “then why don’t we learn this skill at school” – well, congratulations: you’ve just discovered the reason why Watanabe wrote this book in the first place.
He writes:
“Although Japanese business leaders, educators, and politicians have long talked about the need for Japan to shift from ‘memorization-focused education’ to ‘problem-solving-focused education,’ no one had figured out a concrete and effective way to make this happen.”
is Watanabe’s attempt.
And based on the reaction (of both Japan and the world) – it works.
Problem Solving Is a 4-Step Process
To master problem-solving, you just need to master these four steps: 
#1. Understand the current situation;
#2. Identify the root cause of the problem;
#3. Develop an effective action plan; and 
#4. Execute until the problem is solved, making modifications as necessary.
Use These Instruments from Watanabe’s Problem-Solving Tool Box!
And to master the four steps of Watanabe’s problem-solving approach, you need no more than these six problem-solving instruments:
#1. Logic tree;
#2. Yes/No tree;
#3. Problem-solving design plan;
#4. Hypothesis pyramid;

Who Should Read “Enlightenment Now”? And Why?
Let us answer these questions with a question: why wouldn’t you read a much-talked-about book by one who is casually deemed one of the most influential intellectuals of our time?
If you happen to find an answer to 
question which will exempt you from reading

The book all believers in reason and readers tired of all this negativity around need to read, 
is a thoroughly researched vision of human progress, and, in case you need an injection of optimism, the very next book on your reading list.
About Steven Pinker
 is a Canadian-American award-winning linguist, cognitive psychologist and a renowned popularizer of science. He is widely considered one of the most influential intellectuals in the world today.
Pinker earned his reputation as the author of eight language-related Chomsky-inspired books, the most well-known among these being 
, first published in 1994.
During the last decade, however, he has reached a much wider audience through three popular science books (

in which he argues that our future is not that bleak and that, far from being a failed species, humans are actually awesome.

“Enlightenment Now PDF Summary”
A worthy follow-up to 
, 
is a research-based, graph-filled, quotes-adorned apology of Enlightenment values (i.e., reason, science, and humanism), embellished with a firm belief that, unless we stray off this agenda-less path, we are bound to create a better world for all humans.
And you can get this feeling already from the two epigraphs of the book.
The first one is by Baruch Spinoza, one of the original Enlighteners, who probably needs no further introduction: “Those who are governed by reason desire nothing for themselves which they do not also desire for the rest of humankind.”
The second one is by David Deutsch, a physicist, one of Spinoza’s modern descendants, a guy whose 
 we encourage you to see right now: “Everything that is not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge.”
Now that we got you a bit warmed up, time to move on to our summary proper, dividing it (just like Pinker’s book) into three unequal and unsymmetrical parts.
Part I: Enlightenment
Pinker’s book starts with a self-quote, embellished, in his own words, “by the distortions of memory and 
”
It was his “reasonably creditable answer” to “the most arresting question” he has ever been asked: “Why should I live?”
It’s merely an introduction to his discussion, but, honestly, we firmly believe that it is one of the most quotable parts of an otherwise highly quotable and enlightening book.
So, let’s go over it.
“In the very act of asking that question,” replied Pinker to his curious student, “you are seeking reasons for your convictions, and so you are committed to reason as the means to discover and justify what is important to you. And there are so many reasons to live.”
And then he went on:
“And because reason tells you that none of this is particular to you,” Pinker goes on, steering his discussion in the direction of ethics, “you have the responsibility to provide to others what you expect for yourself.”
In other words, “you can foster the welfare of other sentient beings by enhancing life, health, knowledge, freedom, abundance, safety, beauty, and peace. History shows that when we sympathize with others and apply our ingenuity to improving the human condition, we can make progress in doing so, and you can help to continue that progress.”
Beautiful.
Just beautiful.
In the first part of his book, Pinker’s outlines the ideas and values of the Enlightenment in three chapters. 
The first one of these three, “Dare to Understand!” is an introduction to these ideas and values; the second one analyzes why they are important; and the third one rallies against all those who question or subvert them, consciously or unintentionally.
“The Enlightenment has 
,” writes Pinker, and this is “perhaps the greatest story seldom told.”
It is exactly because this triumph is so unsung that “the underlying ideals of reason, science, and humanism are unappreciated as well.”
“Far from being an insipid consensus,” Pinker goes on, “these ideals are treated by today’s intellectuals with indifference, skepticism, and sometimes contempt. When properly appreciated… the ideals of the Enlightenment are in fact stirring, inspiring, noble—a reason to live.”
If you read Pinker’s quote just above this section carefully, you already know that the ideals and values of the Enlightened his book is interested in are reason, science, and humanism.
If you are like most people, you probably take them for granted nowadays, which, in a way, doesn’t make you that better than the counter-enlighteners.
Because, you see, though they have prehistory, reason, science, and humanism are actually pretty new additions to the wide-ranging spectrum of human achievements.
You can trace them back to the second half of the 18
 century when, according to Immanuel Kant’s 1784 essay “
,” humankind emerged from “its self-incurred immaturity,” its “lazy and cowardly” submission to the “dogmas and formulas” of religious or political authority.
The Enlightenment’s motto?
, dare to understand!
Its values and ideals?
• 
: the idea that some things in this world are facts and are, thus, non-negotiable; in other words, some things are true regardless of what the so-called religious or political authorities say;
• 
: structured reasoning; the idea that we can both discover some facts about our existence though experiments and pass them on to future generations as proven;
• 
the
idea that all of us are in this thing together and the revelation that tribalism and random groupings are as primitive as voodoo-magic.
If you don’t understand what the title above means, don’t worry – it’s just a fancy Pinkerian way of saying “entropy, evolution, information.”
Why the three?
Well, first of all, because, whether we wanted or not, we are all necessary victims of 
 – the Second Law of Thermodynamic.
According to its most famous formulation, the entropy of an isolated system never decreases, i.e., a closed system inevitably becomes less structured until it slides “into an equilibrium of gray, tepid, homogeneous monotony and [stays] there.”
But how is entropy relevant to human affairs?
Well, many people nowadays (aka, the Counter-Enlightenments) believe that humanity is not an exception.
Things go from bad to worse day in day out, and one day we too should experience the inevitable end and become a monotonous grey equilibrium of failures.
Pinker begs to differ.
Stats seem to show otherwise: we seem to 
and it’s time we admit that things are getting better all the time.
And why is that?
Well, for one, because we are not an isolated, closed system: ever since the Enlightenment, we are an outrageously huge, smart, and interconnected organism justly called Humanity.
And if we want to continue evolving, we need to commit even stronger to these ideals?
Want a proof?
Well, 
 yourself.
Because, if you are factful, 
.
Of course, many people say that Pinker and people who are optimistic about this stuff are just plain wrong.
After all, stats are correct only until subverted by the 
 or the 
, i.e., the things not taken into consideration because of their rarity, but also the things which tend to have such a devastating effect that they
Think what 
 or 
 might mean for Pinker’s arguments in the long run?
Pinker acknowledges that the impact of the highly unpredictable should not be waved away, but, still, he demonstrates that, these spikes of bad things aside (colonialism, World Wars, Chernobyl, etc.), humanity is obviously getting better and better.
And all those right-wing nationalists or leftist rebels-without-causes would do much better for their own wellbeing (and the wellbeing of everybody) if they just listen to what reason and the data has to say.
Part II: Progress
And this is the reason’s gospel:
Of course, these are Barack Obama’s (and not Pinker’s) words, but either way, they make Pinker’s point clear: we’ve progressed a lot, and people should just stop being progressophobs (theirs is Chapter 4) and rejoice instead.
And here’s the data.
Not that it’s new information, but conspirators of future dystopias and counter-Enlighteners seem to enjoy ignoring this: people are nowadays living longer than ever:
Before the Enlightenment, as you can see from Pinker’s graph, an average person couldn’t expect to live more than 35 years – even in Europe.
Nowadays, the average life expectancy in Europe is over 80!
The best news:
This trend is worldwide.
Meaning, even in Africa, people are nowadays living far longer than they did a century ago!
Of course – and this goes to all the anti-vaxxers out there! – we owe this to many creative and smart members of our species who discovered various 
 sources of diseases and finally substituted prayers, sacrifices, and homeopathy with actual cures, thus saving 
 of lives.
Here are just a few of them:
And there are more!
John Snow was the first epidemiologist, the man who started it all; Karl Landsteiner discovered blood groups; Ignaz Semmelweis and Joseph Lister first introduced equipment- and hand-sterilization into medical practice; and Jonas Salk – well, he discovered the vaccine against polio.
And this is how that day looked like in the States:
“People observed moments of silence, rang bells, honked horns, blew factory whistles, fired salutes… took the rest of the day off, closed their schools or convoked fervid assemblies therein, drank toasts, hugged children, attended church, smiled at strangers, and forgave enemies.”
You know why?
Because millions were saved.
But what about the poor and the hungry, you ask?
Well, they are better as well.
better:
Just a simple comparison:
A century and a half ago, Swedish children were starving to death during the winters; nowadays, it is basically impossible for someone living in Sweden to die.
We didn’t forget the poor.
And we know that it is all but a fact that 99% of the world’s wealth is owned by 1% of the people.
However, Pinker says, it is also a fact that most of the other 99% aren’t doing that bad themselves, 
.
Just two centuries ago, about nine-tenths of the world were living in extreme poverty, and nowadays, countries such as Vietnam, Rwanda and El Salvador (to say nothing of the G8 or economic miracles such as South Korea or Singapore) are doubling their income ever two decades!
The rich are indeed getting richer; but (and this should be shouted out loud as well) 
 are the poor.
Now, of course, with that much wealth, inequality is all but expected.
However, according to some of our most renowned economists, inequality 
level itself out in the long run.
The first name that Pinker throws in the discussion is that of Simon Kuznets, whose hypothetic U-shaped curve argued that as money multiply, inequality rises, but, in time, market forces decrease it.
There are many factors which contribute to this, one of which is something called the Adolph Wagner’s law, according to which the wealthier a country gets, the smarter and more active its people become, resulting in political pressure for that country to spend money on social and welfare programs.
We have to note that, in our view, this chapter is by far the least correct in Pinker’s book. 
Not only he dismisses – by the way faultily, mixing absolute and relative wealth – Piketty’s 
– which has all but demonstrated that Kuznets is wrong and that inequality is raging – but he also interprets much of the data in a rather unscientific manner, to suit his argument.
And this 
the fact that he acknowledges that he can’t pretend here that all the trends are positive.
Speaking of a domain where humanity can fail its host, the Earth – here is how things stand with regard to our relation to the environment:
Strangely enough, capitalist progress hasn’t resulted in an environmental horror, nor the data suggest that more care for the environment should hinder it.
“These diverging curves,” writes Pinker commenting the graph above, “refute both the orthodox Green claim that only degrowth can curb pollution and the orthodox right-wing claim that environmental protection must sabotage economic growth and people’s standard of living.”
It seems plainly wrong, at a day and age when we hear about violent deaths on a daily basis, to argue that the Earth is now safer and more peaceful than ever.
And yet, the data shows that this is true:
More people are nowadays 
, and there are far fewer wars and homicides (the United States being, unfortunately, the only highly developed country where the latter are a problem). 
Also, the world is a far safer place to live in today than fifty and hundred years ago – in just about any category: work-related deaths, plane crashes, vehicle accidents, drownings, fires – and even falls!
During the fascist uprisings of the 1920s, there were only 12 democratic nations in the world.
As of 2015 – there are 103!
Some may say that democracy is overrated, but it is not: it is the best idea the enlightened minds of the 18
 century devised as a way to fight against autocracy and leadership breakdowns.
Think of it this way – as bad as it is, democratic nations almost never experience bloody revolutions because you can always vote for another Party four years later.
Of course, the more democratic a country is, the more equal the rights of its citizens. 
China may be the second most powerful country in the world, but as far as regular humans are concerned, they’d probably choose to live in South Korea, because their rights are much more protected there:
And as history has proven, knowledge and education evolve far better in democratic countries, and, during the past century or so, this has all but annihilated sexism and racism.
True, they are still there, but bear this in mind: with the exception of Vatican, women can vote everywhere nowadays, something which was unimaginable just a hundred years ago even in the most developed societies!
Back to terrorism, unhappiness and other existential threats.
As you can only suppose by now, Pinker is not that bothered by them.
And, to cut the long story short, you shouldn’t be either – and for a very simple reason: the graphs above.
After all, if you’re more likely to die due to a bee sting or a suicide than a terrorist attack, then why all this dread?
The days when nuclear wars seemed possible are long gone. The world is much wealthier, healthier, and safer. There are two superpowers (China and the USA), but they are not nearly as antagonistic to each other as the USSR and the USA.
Ironically, you feel so much dread and anxiety 
 because you’re living at the best time of history. Your education and knowledge make you wonder about things your predecessors 
did.
Fight this dread with 
knowledge – because the data is on your side!
Part III: Reason, Science, and Humanism
After outlining the ideas of the Enlightenment in the first part and demonstrating that they actually work in the second, Pinker wraps up his defense of the Enlightenment in the short, concluding third part of his book.
Here he tries to defend science against the attacks of all those Luddites who blame everything from eugenics through racism to Nazism on the ideals of the Enlightenment.
However, Pinker confidently shows that the idea of the Aryan race was devised by a fiction writer (damn you, Arthur de Gobineau, damn you to hell!), that proponents of eugenics are rarely for sterilizing “unfit” people and always for incentivizing talented people to procreate, and that climate change is real and not a Chinese conspiracy.
Donald Trump, Pinker’s looking at you!
And he thinks that you are an outlier, a statistical mistake. The educated didn’t vote for you, just as they didn’t vote for Brexit. 
And just as they will never vote for autocratic, religious, tyrannical governments which oppress human freedom and believe in things eighth-graders know to be wrong nowadays.
Key Lessons from “Enlightenment Now”
1.      The Enlightenment Believed in Reason, Science, and Humanism
2.      The World Is Getting Better
3.      Counter-Enlighteners Are Outliers
The Enlightenment Believed in Reason, Science, and Humanism
Before the second half of the 18
 century, the world was much bleaker than the world of today.
The reason?
There were no facts, and people in positions of power could use their influence to fabricate reality.
However, then a group of scientific-minded philosophers decided that we must restructure our world; and so, they did, rebuilding it upon the foundations of reason, science, and humanism.
The result?
The world of today, better than ever.
The World Is Getting Better
Regardless of whether we’re talking about life and health, or wealth, inequality and sustenance – people are nowadays better off than they were before the Enlightenment.
The same holds true with regard to safety and democracy, to equal rights and education, and even with regard to happiness.
In one sentence, the world is – 
 and 
 – getting better.
So, stop moaning!
Counter-Enlighteners Are Outliers
Speaking of moaning, there are quite a few important people nowadays who believe in unscientific things (anti-vaxxers, racists, hardcore environmentalists, alt-rightists, far leftists, religious people, etc.)
The bad news: there always will be.
The good news: they are fewer and fewer.
And even though it may seem that nationalism and racism are on the rise, they are not; in a few years, Trump, Erdogan, Putin, Orban, Le Pen – they shall all pass, and the world will go on marching forward.
The way it has for the past two centuries.

“Show Your Work PDF Summary”
Even if your profession does not revolve around art, I still consider you should check out this book. Most probably it will show you a totally new perspective on your own life and the way you approach the professional side of it.
I was tremendously blessed to get in contact with this book at just the right moment of my life.
With an education in graphic design and with the stubbornness of earning my own living out of my art, Austin Kleon’s book had an impressive motivational effect upon me.
The deep and extremely useful message of this book is empowered by the author’s personal vast and relevant experience. This 
 of Austin Kleon easily turns into the key concept of his book ‘

It is about a 
 containing all the 
 ‘from zero to hero’.
But who is  
? An American writer and artist living in Austin, Texas, bestselling author of three illustrated books:
‘Newspaper Blackout’
‘Show Your Work!’
Beyond all those covers he described himself as “a writer who draws” who makes “art with words and books with pictures”.
The title of Austin Kleon’s latest book is suggestive enough and even over-descriptive for the actual content of the book. Consequently, the author shares with his readers 
 and to get discovered in order to pursue their professional career in art.
By this “10 steps master plan” Austin Kleon ingeniously intends to offer a helping hand to all the aspiring artists on the market.
The first lesson that Austin Kleon kindly teaches us is that ‘
 in order to achieve self-contentment regarding your career as an artist.
Sometimes, being an amateur proves to be much more helpful than being an expert. That’s because amateurs have that rare quality of approaching every new situation with freshness and innocence. And in the end, this kind of approach always leads to spectacular results!
Austin Kleon 
 that most of us are accustomed with by simply putting things straight:
Good work isn’t created in a vacuum.
Hence, he invites us to step out our comfort zones and to start creating connections with other people and expose ourselves to other people. Within this context, the author emphasizes the great importance of sharing information when you pursue an artistic profession:
The second step of ‘Sharing Our Creativity and Getting Discovered’ plan refers to ‘Thinking Process, Not Product’.
As most of us are used to

Despite this first impression, Austin unravels a deep truth about every artist’s aspiring career: 
Lesson learnt: every artist should adapt to this new communication era and start exploring the multiple opportunities of the virtual universe. So, for an artist to be online and to be engaged in sharing information about his work it’s a must!
Online generosity is among the best attitudes that an artist can adopt both at the beginning of his career and along with his ongoing career.
Even though sharing is extremely important, the author warns us in a pretty ironic way that the content of the things we choose to share online also matters: 
As 
 of our ‘Getting Discovered’ process, Austin Kleon makes an invitation for us to

Do you know who Alcestis was?
We guarantee you that you’ll do once you finish this book.
Also, we guarantee you a lot of fun and, quite possibly, a dropped jaw.
Ladies and gentlemen, our summary of Alex Michaelides’ debut:
.
Who Should Read “The Silent Patient”? And Why?
Described by its author as “a kind of psychological Agatha Christie,” 
is more than just another thriller: it is “an unforgettable – and Hollywood-bound – new thriller” (as pronounced by 
)
If you like detective novels and Hitchcock movies, Michaelides’ book is the perfect blend of both; and you’ll certainly enjoy it.
Alex Michaelides Biography
 is an American writer and screenwriter.
Born to a Greek-Cypriot father and English mother in Cyprus in 1977, Michaelides earned an MA in English literature from Cambridge University and an MFA in Screenwriting from the American Film Institute in Los Angeles.
After authoring the screenplays of two widely panned movies – 
and 
– Michaelides turned to writing.
His first novel, 
, has received rave reviews and will be adapted into a movie by Brad Pitt’s production company, Plan B.
Plot
Described as “the perfect thriller” by none other than 
, Alex Michaelides’ debut 
 novel, 
 – is mainly narrated from the first-person perspective of 
, forensic psychotherapist.
However, it is also interspersed with pages taken out of 
 diary, a famous painter, the woman Theo is trying to help.
Even though it can be argued that it doesn’t do that much justice to this complexly plotted yet finely narrated and easily readable novel, we’ll try to stick to this structure in our summary as well.
Six Years Later
Six years later, 
, a forensic psychotherapist with a history of addiction and an abusive childhood, informs us that, for reasons unknown, Alicia Berenson murdered Gabriel six years before the present day.
(Unlike Theo, the dumbfounded readers know immediately that this happened around the time Alicia wrote the diary entry above).
Apparently, after shooting her husband five times in the face, Alicia was found by the police with a gun in her hand, trying to commit suicide.
From then on, she stopped talking, never saying a word to anyone; the only thing of any note she managed to produce in the meantime was a single painting, a naked self-portrait enigmatically titled Alcestis.
Despite the numerous attempts of the media to find out Alicia’s motive, this is basically everything anyone knows about the night of the murder.
And that’s where Theo comes into play.
Due to his abusive childhood and the fact that he was saved from insanity by his therapist (
), Theo firmly believes that he can save Alicia.
So, he goes to the Grove, a mental asylum where, thanks to its head, 
 
, who advocated it as a better place for her than prison, Alicia Berenson is located at the present moment.
However – and as expected – their first therapy session is a failure: Alicia is heavily medicated, and so, she is not even able to understand Theo, let alone engage in a meaningful conversation.
Theo tries to look for answers elsewhere: he contacts Alicia’s brother-in-law 
, and her aunt 
; to no avail: they refuse to speak to him as well; we guess it runs in the family.
Speaking of family – we learn soon after that Theo is married to a woman named Kathy.
And he loves her very, very much.
Problems in Paradise
Back in the present, Theo asks Lazarus Diomedes to reduce Alicia’s medication so that he is able to talk to her; Diomedes agrees.
However, Christian, the head of Alicia’s care team, is not that pleased: he thinks that Theo (whom he knows from a previous job) went behind his back; in the end – though reluctantly – he agrees to lower Alicia’s dosage.
This bears some results: at the next therapy session, Alicia attacks Theo. In 99 out of 100 cases, that’s a bad thing, but you know how psychotherapists are: even bad emotions are better than no emotions.
Theo Faber is certain that a breakthrough is imminent.
To his surprise, Theo receives a phone call from 
, Gabriel’s adopted brother, and Alicia’s lawyer. He suggests to Theo that he contacts 
, owner of a small Soho gallery which represents Alicia.
Max’s wife 
has another suggestion: talk to

everything
Paul Rose and Jean-Felix Martin
Back in the present, Diomedes advises Theo to stop interviewing Alicia’s family members – and to especially stay away from Max. 
The Grove has problems staying open the way it is, Diomedes says, and angering a powerful lawyer such as Max will certainly not help them.
Unfortunately, Theo cares more about Alicia than about the Grove.
So, naturally, the very next thing he does is paying 
 and 
 a visit; it is a completely unannounced one, so you can’t blame Paul for knocking out Theo: he thinks that he is a burglar.
However, things go pretty well afterward.
After telling him that he hasn’t talked to Alicia for years, Paul reveals to Theo that, in addition to Alicia’s mother, her father, 
, had also committed suicide.
Quite the family, ha?
And you ain’t heard nothing yet!
As Theo deduces from her words and behavior – by the way, she does chase Theo away angrily – both Alicia and Paul might have been abused by Paul’s mother, Lydia!
And Jean-Felix?
Well, Theo visits him as well at the gallery and, in a brief discussion, realizes that Theo may be in love with Alicia’s paintings much more than he was ever with her – as some of her family had initially suspected.
Jean-Felix suggests to Theo that he should read Euripides’ play 
(By the way, a masterpiece.)
Art Therapy for a Modern Alcestis
After finishing Euripides’ play, Theo realizes why Alicia has titled her last self-portrait Alcestis.
In the tragedy, Alcestis sacrifices her life for her husband Admetus – when not even his parents are willing to – only to be taken out of Hades by Heracles. However, after she comes back to earth, she remains completely silent.
Theo explains to Diomedes that this must bear some relation to Alicia’s life. She is metaphorically dead, he says, perhaps because she sacrificed a lot of things for her husband and he didn’t reciprocate at the same extent.
Anyway, since Alicia is not talking, Theo suggests that she undergoes art therapy. Perhaps, he now believes, she’d communicate her thoughts better through her own medium: lines and colors.
The idea is accepted and, within a few days, it results in a strange painting: the Grove on fire, and Theo carrying Alicia in his arms in front of the asylum.
It is, however, difficult to comprehend whether Theo is saving Alicia or dragging her 
 the flames.
During a visit of hers, Theo gets acquainted with 
, Alicia’s neighbor and friend. She learns during a second discussion that Alicia had confided to Barbie that she had a stalker, a fact apparently unknown to anyone else.

The Diary
At the Grove, Alicia stabs 
, one of the violent nurses there, with a paintbrush in the eye. From Elif, Theo learns that she did this after Elif taunted her by telling her that Theo was actually in love with her.
Of course, the event puts an end to Alicia’s art therapy sessions, and a ban on Theo’s visits; Theo visits Alicia one final time to apologize for not helping her as much as he thought he would.
Alicia’s answer?
She gives him her diary.
Now, Theo knows everything you know at this point.
And, unlike you, he puts two and two together and realizes that Dr. West must be Christian – unlike you, he 
 know his surname – and confronts him.
Christian reveals to him that the meetings were secret and tells him everything he knows about Alicia; however, Theo decides that he is a bad doctor, and Alicia a much more honest person than him, so he goes to her and asks about Christian.
Alicia is disappointed by the question and – surprise! surprise! – says nothing, so Theo visits the members of her family and close surroundings, one by one.
The only one willing to talk to him is Paul.
And he tells him something which might reveal the true nature of Alicia’s “metaphorical” death.
Namely, soon after Eva Rose’s suicide, her husband Vernon asked Alicia why didn’t she die instead of her mother.
A great way to guarantee your daughter a lifetime of pain, don’t you think?
Anyway, after this discussion, Alicia said to Paul that Vernon had just “killed” her. 
Could this explain Alicia acting all Alcestis for the last six years?
Alicia Talks
Theo storms to the Grove once again and tells Alicia the news; Alicia finally – after six years of silence – starts talking. 
Session after session (now that Alicia is talking, Diomedes allows the visits,  Theo learns everything he needs to learn about her childhood, which, if filmed, would be less believable than a Baron von Munchausen story.
That’s how messed up it is!
To sum up for you (and for now):
Both of Alicia’s parents killed themselves, and one of them might have even tried to kill her as well.
In the meantime, the other blamed her for this suicide and metaphorically killed her by asking her “why didn’t she die?”
Afterward, her aunt abused her and her cousin.
To make matters worse, when she finally got her life in order, her husband’s brother professed her love for her and tried to rape her.
And then a man started stalking her – something absolutely nobody believed her.
One day, Alicia finally opens up about the events which led to the murder of Gabriel.
According to her, it was the stalker who had killed her husband, after tying her up and stealing Gabriel’s gun.
Unfortunately, this doesn’t match the police report, so Theo is pretty sure that Alicia is lying.
However, he doesn’t get the chance to find out more, because the very next day Alicia falls into a coma, after overdosing with morphine.
Theo angrily blames Christian for this and heads back home.
The Silent Patient Epilogue
The Truth About Kathy
The Final Diary Entry
Before passing out from the morphine, Alicia writes one final diary entry.
In it, she reveals that she had suspected Theo from the start, but it wasn’t until later that she found out for sure that he was the stalker.
And what a self-righteous stalker he was!
Apparently, on the night of the murder, Theo broke into the Berenson house and tied up the two spouses.
Alicia begged Theo not to kill her husband, but after Theo asked Gabriel if he should kill him or his wife, he said “Alicia.”
Theo merely pretended to have shot Alicia, firing a shot into the ceiling, but Alicia was already metaphorically dead – and for the second time.
Because unlike her and just like Alcestis’ husband Admetus, Gabriel wasn’t interested in sacrificing himself for her, meaning all his words of love were empty.
So, when Theo left, Alicia grabbed the gun and shot Gabriel five times in the face.
The Epilogue of the Epilogue
In discussion with 
, a consultant psychotherapist at the Grove, Theo reveals that it was never his intention for anyone to die.
On the contrary: he merely wanted Alicia to see the truth and seek out a better life for herself, for she had been in the very same position as him in his relationship with Kathy.
He came to the Grove to absolve himself from guilt, but also because he still wants to help Kathy, even though she is in a comma.
Despite this, Theo is frustrated when he is unable to recover Alicia’s diary, fearing that its updated version must hold incriminating information against him.
Theo goes home to his wife Kathy who we finally meet her in the present.
She is not that unlike Alicia, a shadow of her former self, mostly silent and incapable of coming to terms with Gabriel’s death; she has never admitted her infidelity.
Suddenly, inspector Steven Allen arrives at the house of the Fabers. 
He has Alicia’s diary in his hands.

Want to write better?
Well, it all starts with reading better.
And Francine Prose is here to teach you how you can start:
Who Should Read “Reading Like a Writer”? And Why?
is yet another manual for reading, not unlike Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren’s classic 
and its more modern companion, 
by Thomas C. Foster.
You can’t go wrong with either one of these three; though Francine Prose’s book is more personal than the other two, all of them are so great that we firmly believe that they might just work.

“Reading Like a Writer PDF Summary”
Subtitled “A Guide for People Who Love Books and for Those Who Want to Write Them,” Francine Prose’s 
is essentially a Reading 101 textbook for everyone who wants to become a poet or a novelist – or thinks that he/she is one at the moment.
A sort of a personal journey through the world of books (and especially those who made Prose the writer that she is today), the book is filled with examples from literary masterworks and even includes a list of “books to be read immediately” for anyone interested at the end.
Let’s summarize it, chapter by chapter (each of which deals with a different aspect of the writing craft, starting with words and ending with, well, the master of masters, 
).
Chapter One: Close Reading
Do you know how most of the great artists you’ve grown to admire throughout the years acquired and perfected their craft?
The simplest answer: they spent years studying and imitating the works of their predecessors.
So why should literature be any different?
Instinctively, it may be not.
After all, children read slowly, mouthing almost every word they encounter upon a page. Unlike them, adults seem to only know how to read fast.
!
In Prose’s belief – which we full-heartedly share – the difference between a slow reader and a fast one is the difference between a refined gourmet and a junk-food eater.
Simply put, you won’t feel all the flavors in the latter-case scenario, and, to use another analogy we’ll get back to in our summary of the last chapter, you’ll probably mistake a rose for a weed.
The solution?
Pay closer attention. 
Approach great books as you would riddles: 
, meaning their authors want you to break some sweat and discover at least some of them, the way Redditors do when they hunt for TV show’s Easter eggs.
For example, 
 and, especially, 
are much, much better books if, in addition to the story, you focus on the motifs of blindness and seeing.
Prose experienced this when she was a 16-year-old student given this very assignment.
“It was fun to trace those patterns and to make those connections,” she writes. “It was like cracking a code that the playwright had embedded in the text, a riddle that existed just for me to decipher.”
Suddenly, the “reading better makes you a better writer” idea doesn’t sound that strange, does it?
Chapter Two: Words
There are hundreds of thousands of words in the English language.
About half a million according to Wikipedia.
How much is that, you wonder?
Well, consider the fact that the full number of entries in the multi-volume 
 is merely a half of that.
Why is this important?
Well, because 
 and not paying close attention to all of them – aka skim-reading them – is not too dissimilar from listening just the first minute of a song, then skipping to the third one and listening to a few seconds and then to the last 20 seconds.
In Prose’s words:
In other words, if you want to read – read 
 of the words.
, there are countless of word-combinations and, for some reason, some authors have made the decision to use a certain one (and not another).
Your job?
Compel yourself to reading each and every word on a page by asking yourself what sort of information each word – i.e., each word choice – is conveying.
It’s slow – we know.
But 
the point.
Chapter Three: Sentences
Now, words form sentences, so the next level of reading is that of the sentence.
“The well-made sentence,” writes Prose, “transcends time and genre. A beautiful sentence is a beautiful sentence, regardless of when it was written, or whether it appears in a play or a magazine article.”
But how you should find one, or, if you are a writer, compose one?
Is it supposed to be a short one or a long one? Does it need to be alliterative and lyrical or impartial and, to use a word 
 famously uses in 
,
?
If you’re looking for a straightforward answer, don’t look for it in this book! 
There are numerous writers who became famous because of their mastery of short sentences (Hemingway being the most famous example) and many others who became the object of admiration because of their meandering, indescribably beautiful 100+ word sentences (Marcel Proust, we’re looking at you!)
Also, there are some sentences which sound even more lyrical than verses (remember the concluding ones of 
), and some others which, though long and objectively written seem as clear and as precise as Hemingway’s five-word sentences (Prose offers as an example the opening of Heinrich von Kleist’s story “The Earthquake in Chile”).
But, then, there’s one thing you 
 do to make your sentences sound sweeter and more majestic.
Read your work aloud.
“Chances are that the sentence you can hardly pronounce without stumbling,” writes Prose, “is a sentence that needs to be reworked to make it smoother and more fluent.”
Also, if a thief breaks into your apartment while you’re doing this, he/she will probably run away thinking you a madman.
True story.
Chapter Four: Paragraphs
If words form sentences, sentences form paragraphs; and paragraphs are not merely the building blocks of a story, but also its DNA, the author’s fingerprints on his/her work:
Now, 
 paragraph is not written by Prose, but by Rex Stout and comes from one of his 
mysteries; it is uttered by the detective Nero Wolfe when tasked with finding out if three manuscripts are plagiarized by one and the same person.
Apparently, in his view, they must be, because we write paragraphs too instinctively to falsify them; Proust believed that a writer’s style embeds his/her vision of the world; and, style, Stout adds, is made of paragraphs.
Prose’s piece of advice when it comes to paragraphs?
Think of them as a kind of literary breathing.
Too many short paragraphs make your text asthmatic; too many long ones will make your reader breathless (in the worst possible way).
Chapter Five: Narration
On to narration and narrators!
The best rule of thumb: use first-person or third-person narration and an 
 narrator.
Notice how we highlighted the word interesting?
It’s because that’s all it takes: the narrator needs to intrigue your readers, and it doesn’t matter if he’s someone you wouldn’t hang out with in real life.
In fact, more often than not, these are the most interesting narrators.
Consider the beginning of 
:
“Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins, My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta. She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita.”
Now, the speaker of these words is a lunatic enamored with an underage girl; in real life, Humbert Humbert probably belongs in prison.
But, in the world of literature, he’s exactly the kind of guy you’ll be interested in knowing more about.
He may be a lunatic, Prose says, but he is a “brilliant, inventive, self-dramatizing, self-mocking, obsessive lunatic genius.”
And who wouldn’t want to get to know one when there’s no danger lurking around the corner (except for papercuts)?
Chapter Six: Character
Unless a peculiarity, a novel can’t exist without characters, and the characterization of one can be done via one or all of these ways: through his/her actions, thoughts, and words.
Chapter seven is dedicated to the last of the three, and in this chapter, Prose compares the method of Heidrich von Kleist with that of Jane Austen to demonstrate how one can master the first two.
“Among the unusual things about the way that Kleist creates his characters,” Prose writes analyzing Kleist’s novella 
, “is that he does so entirely without physical description.”
“There is no information, not a single detail, about the Marquise’s appearance,” she goes on. “We never hear how a room looks, or what the latest fashion might be, or what people are eating and drinking. We assume that the Marquise is beautiful, perhaps because her presence exerts such an immediate and violent effect on the Russian soldier that he loses all control and turns from an angel into a devil. But we can only surmise that.”
In a word, Kleist “tells us just as much as we need to know about his characters, then releases them into the narrative that doesn’t stop spinning until the last sentence.”
On the opposite side of the spectrum, Jane Austen (
), introduces us to her characters by telling us almost everything about them.
“In Kleist,” concludes Prose, “characters tend to be defined by their actions. But Austen is more likely to create her men and women by telling us what they think, what they have done, and what they plan to do.”
Chapter Seven: Dialogue
How many times have you heard literature professors and creative writing teachers advising you to clean up and polish your dialogue?
Fictional dialogue can’t sound like actual speech, they say:
“Then why,” asks Prose, “is so much written dialogue less colorful and interesting than what we can overhear daily in the Internet café, the mall, and on the subway?”
You know why?
Because of advices such as the one above.
Just like psychotherapists, readers should train themselves uncovering secret meanings even beneath the surface of banal words.
If you feel like your character would use them – then let him use them.
Dialogue should always provide both text and subtext, “allowing us to observe the wide range of emotions that [your] characters feel and display, the ways in which they say and don’t say what they mean, attempt to manipulate their spouses, lovers, friends, and children, stake emotional claims, demonstrate sexual interest or unavailability, confess and conceal their hopes and fears.”
Yup: that much is at stake.
Chapter Eight: Details
True, many authors (including Prose) claim that in a literary work, every word matters and counts. But they forget to add that it doesn’t matter and count in the same manner.
Put simply, some words reveal more than it seems that they do on the surface; however, others, reveal nothing, but are meant to leave a memorable impression of the “why would this author mention something like this?”
Here’s a great example:
In one case (Mark 8:22-26), Jesus makes a blind man see from the second attempt. The first attempt obviously fails, since, after it, the blind man of Bethsaida sees men “like trees, walking.”
Now, many theologists ask (and this is called 
), why would Mark write something like that 
 it wasn’t true?
Regardless of whether you believe in the Bible or not, a great answer is this: because the writer knew people would ask questions such as the one above.
That’s what all liars know and, in a way, writers are not that dissimilar from liars.
If you want to be a good one, be mindful of the details – and include at least a few which would make your readers ask: “now, why would he/she mention something like this?”
Chapter Nine: Gestures
Another important type of detail in a literary work is a character’s gestures.
For example, consider the brilliant Katherine Mansfield short story “The Fly.”
In it, the protagonist, called merely “the boss,” is visited by a friend, Mr. Woodifield, who happens to inadvertently mention the protagonist’s son’s grave; the boss’s son, we learn, was killed six years before this meeting in the First World War, “a death the boss never mentions and tries not to think about.”
Stricken with anguish, but (to his surprise) unable to shed a single tear, soon after Mr. Woodifield leaves, the boss notices a fly fallen into his inkpot.
He rescues it, watches it dry, and then drops a blob of ink onto it; and then, after some time, another; and then, finally, a third one; the fly struggles through it all, but is unable to survive the third drop.
It’s easy to interpret this gesture over-simply, writes Prose: the boss’s grief has moved him to do violence to a harmless fly. 
However, “the delicate shifts in the boss’s emotions and his responses to the fly’s struggle move us beyond this surface reading to consider the distractions of casual cruelty, the pleasures of playing god as a means of mediating one’s own sense of powerlessness, and the perverse desire to pass pain on to anyone – anything – who is weaker and more helpless than we are.”
What a gesture, ha?
Hunt for such illuminative acts – and ignore all “physical clichés.”
Chapter Ten: Learning from Chekhov
You need a writer to learn from the craft of writing?
There’s one: it’s not Shakespeare or Tolstoy or Goethe or Dante.
It’s Chekhov, the greatest short story writer of all time (according to many writers), one whose sentences will make you think that maybe things aren’t so bad after all, an author whose works (and almost all of them, mind you!) are “not only profound and beautiful, but also involving.”
Chekhov can teach you to write without judgment – i.e., be the unbiased observer – and to break the “rules” of writing when rules are meant to be broken.
Plus: there’s no way you’re not going to enjoy his short stories.
And, quite perhaps, be irretrievably moved and changed by at least a few of them.
Chapter Eleven: Reading for Courage
It’s scary to put yourself out there at the mercy and mercilessness of other people; that’s why actors have stage fright, and that’s why writers are afraid of the blank page.
And then there’s also the inevitable fear of pointlessness: to paraphrase Broch, is it not inhumane to care about whether the word you’ve selected or the sentence you’ve constructed is beautiful when there are about 2 billion poor people around today?
As far as Prose is concerned, you need to dispel those fears: there’s always a point in planting more roses in this world.
And reading is a way to see how other rose-growers grow their roses.
“If we want to write,” Prose ends her book, “it makes sense to read – and to read like a writer. If we wanted to grow roses, we would want to visit rose gardens and try to see them the way that a rose gardener would.”
Books to Be Read Immediately
In one final chapter, Prose includes a long list of book recommendations; there’s no point in copying it here since you can find

Key Lessons from “Reading Like a Writer”
1.      Language Is the Medium of Writers 
2.      There Is No Such Thing as Fast Reading
3.      Slow Readers Make the Best Writers
Language Is the Medium of Writers 
True, this lesson sounds both banal and trivial, but somehow it is still an “oddly underappreciated fact.”
Why would Prose think that?
Well, simply put, because if you really believed that words are to writers what notes are to musicians and paint is to painters, then you wouldn’t read so fast!
There Is No Such Thing as Fast Reading
How do you know when you’re really enjoying a song?
Well, for one, you don’t skip a beat.
That’s what you do all the time when you’re reading.
The truth is, if so, you’re not reading 
.
You’re actually just watching a movie on fast-forward, not immersing yourself within the experience nor actually learning anything.
Slow Readers Make the Best Writers
Want to become a better writer?
Well, then, start reading slowly.
Savor every word, analyze every sentence, follow motifs and symbols, jot down your notes on the margins of interesting paragraphs.
Also, read aloud every single word you’ll ever write.
If it doesn’t sound good enough when you hear it, then probably it isn’t.
“I’ve often argued that the only skill any writer needs,” writes Oxford Professor of Poetry Simon Armitage 
,
“is the ability to see his or her work from the other side. That is, to put him or herself in the position of the reader.”
Francine Prose feels pretty much the same.

Are you a therapist or a patient?
Then you should really read Irvin D. Yalom’s open letter to all therapists and patients out there:
.
Who Should Read “The Gift of Therapy”? And Why?
is primarily a book targeting therapists: especially those who already know something about Yalom and existential therapy and are familiar with the theoretical aspects of the practice.
However, the very fact that it is not systematic and structured makes it a great introductory book for patients to psychotherapy: if therapists train themselves to look through your window, here’s your chance to look through theirs.
You may see a healthier you from the other side.
About Irvin D. Yalom
 is an American existential psychotherapist, emeritus professor of psychiatry at Stanford University, and a bestselling author of both non-fiction and fiction books.
Born to Russian parents in Washington D.C., Yalom developed a personal model of existential psychotherapy in the 1970s and his 1980 book 
is considered the classical introduction to the form.
He has written as many fiction as non-fiction books, the most famous of which, 
, was adapted into a movie in 2007.

“The Gift of Therapy PDF Summary”
First published in 2001 – sometime around the author’s 70
 birthday – 
, as stated by its blurb, is “the culmination of master psychiatrist Dr. Irvin D. Yalom’s more than forty-five years in clinical practice.”
And despite the fact that, at 87, Yalom is still alive and kicking in 2019, and, has written six more books in the meantime in addition to seeing at least two documentaries made about him, 
 also feels as a kind of a testament.
As poignant as essential, Yalom’s book – which has gone through several edition since its first publication – can be described as a collection of advices given by someone who has come to the end of his journey as a psychotherapist and now looks back to discover the highs and lows and so that he can pass on his knowledge to a new generation of psychotherapists.
Consequently, it’s no wonder that the book consists of 85 chapters, most of them no longer than two or three pages, and each one focusing on an important aspect of Yalom’s works and beliefs. 
In the “Introduction,” Yalom provides a tentative structure of his book; naturally, we’ll try to follow it in our summary.
Introduction
“It is daunting to realize that I am entering a designated later era of life,” writes one of America’s leading psychotherapists, Irvin D. Yalom, at the beginning of 
. 
“My goals, interests, and ambitions are changing in predictable fashion,” he adds, implying that if in the past his job was to take and teach patients, now his goal is to guide and inspire a new generation of psychotherapists.
However, he says, this is exceedingly problematic today, because, in Yalom’s opinion, the field in serious crisis.
“An economically driven health-care system,” he writes, “mandates a radical modification in psychological treatment, and psychotherapy is now obliged to be streamlined – that is, above all, 
 and, perforce, brief, superficial, and insubstantial.”
Consequently, Yalom is worried that what he leaves behind is a world in which psychotherapy is seen as just another job from which someone is to make a profit, rather than a humane discipline whose sole objective is to help people – regardless of the cost.
He writes, movingly:
And yet, Yalom concludes, if not only because of this endangered species (or exactly because there are so few of them), it makes sense to write a book such as 
.
“Since first entering the field of psychiatry,” Yalom says, “I have had two abiding interests: group therapy and existential therapy.”
These two are parallel interests, but, nevertheless, they are also separate: as Yalom says, just as there can be no group therapy for one person, there’s also no such thing as existential group therapy. 
The two things differ in their 
.
In groups, Yalom’s frame of reference is 
 and is based on the assumption that patients “fall into despair because of their inability to develop and sustain gratifying interpersonal relationships.”
However, when Yalom deals with a single patient, he operates within an 
, which is firmly rooted within the conviction that patients fall into despair due to a confrontation with the “harsh facts of human condition – the ‘givens’ of existence.”
If you have problems understanding what existential psychotherapy actually is, Yalom provides a neat definition: “Existential psychotherapy is a dynamic therapeutic approach that focuses on concerns rooted in existence.”
However, a definition makes no sense if you don’t understand the meaning of the words it encompasses.
So, here’s the necessary vocabulary to understand Yalom’s existential approach:
• 
is a philosophical study of the human being as a thinking, acting, feeling, and living being in search of authentic existence; (to understand this even better, we warmly suggest you read our summaries of 
 and 
)
• 
is here used in the technical sense, implying that the forces in conflict with the individual “exist at varying levels of awareness; indeed 
.”
• Finally, there are four ultimate 
, i.e., four 
: death, isolation, meaning in life, and freedom. 
Now that you have understood the theoretical definition of existential therapy, it’s time that you understand a bit better how it works in practice.
And to do this, first you must make a distinction between two major aspects of therapy discourse: content and process:
• 
is just what the word says it is: “the precise words spoken, the substantive issues addressed.” 
• 
, on the other hand, refers to the “interpersonal relationship between the patient and the therapist.”
In other and plainer words: it is one thing to explicitly start a discussion about death, isolation, meaning and freedom (content), and a completely another thing to implicitly derive conclusions from stories which seemingly bear no relation to these existential topics.
“Therapy should not be 
,” writes Yalom, reminding us of 
, “but 
.”
In fact, that’s exactly how this book was born!
Because, in theory, you can say that existential psychotherapy is all about the givens of existence, but in practice, it would be both contra-productive and fruitless to force upon a patient a discussion which includes any of them explicitly.
“A heightened sensibility to existential issues” and awareness of the 
 of interpersonal communication is what helps a psychotherapist really understand what do the actual 
 of the words of the patients says about them, their health, and their objectives.
Described by Yalom as both “a sequence of tips for therapists,” and “a nuts-and-bolts collection of favorite interventions or statements,” 
is “long on technique and short on theory.”
Consequently, the book should not be understood and/or used as a “systematic manual,” but as “a supplement to a comprehensive training program.”
Originally, it began as a list of more than two hundred pieces of advice only to be pruned away by Yalom to the most essential eighty-five.
These are chosen, by Yalom’s own admission, quite haphazardly, but are grouped, as an afterthought, in five tentative sections:
• 
 (therapist-patient relationship): first 40 chapters;
• 
: chapters 41 to 51;
• 
: chapters 52 to 76;
• 
: chapters 77 to 83; and
• 
: the last two chapters.
Process (1 – 40)
Here are the highlights from the first section:
#1. Remove obstacles to growth;
#2. Except in extreme cases – and for insurance companies – avoid diagnosis: you are talking with a unique human being, not with a general concept;
#3. Think of your patient as a fellow traveler, not as your follower;
#4. Engage your patient in a deeply personal relationship through discussion;
#5. Be supportive;
#6. Be sympathetic: look out the patient’s window;
#7. Do not only practice but also 
 empathy;
#8. Let the patient matter to you;
#9. Acknowledge your errors: mistakes bring people closer;
#10. Treat all of your patients as individuals: create a new therapy for each of them;
#11. Talk the talk, but also walk the walk;
#12. Engage in personal therapy;
#13. Never forget that while the therapist has many patients, the patient has only one therapist;
#14 – #24. Use the Here-and-Now method: your patients are not only their past experience but also what’s happening during the therapy sessions; develop here-and-now rabbit ears by keeping in mind a simple principle (particularly evident in group therapy: 
;
#25. Forget the blank screen: instead of being a robot, be 
to your patient;
#26 – #32. There are three realms of self-disclosure: a) the mechanism of therapy: be transparent; b) revealing here-and-now-feelings: use discretion; and c) revealing the therapist’s own personal life: use caution;
#33. Avoid the crooked cure;
#34. If you can – and it is possible – take your patients further than you have gone;
#35. Sometimes allow your patient to help 
;
#36. Encourage patient self-disclosure;
#37. Use the Johari window for feedback;
#38. Provide feedback effectively and gently;
#39. Increase receptiveness to feedback by using “parts;”
#40. As far as feedback is concerned – strike when the iron is cold.
Content (41 – 51)
The second part comprises eleven pieces of advice.
The first three (#41 – #43) concern the first given of existence: 
.
“Though the physicality of death destroys us,” writes Yalom, “the idea of death may save us.”
That’s why it is important to talk about it.
It is discussions about death which help us move from our everyday mode of existence (full of distractions with our material surroundings) to an ontologic mode of being (filled with wonderment and readiness for change).
Yalom’s advice #44 concerns two givens of existence: life meaning and isolation.
Unlike other beings, humans are unique in the fact that they are meaning-seeking creatures. However, 
, the goal of the journey is the journey itself.
It doesn’t matter if one finds meaning; what matters is the engagement in the pursuit; and therapists need to remove all isolation-creating obstacles to this engagement. 
After this, the book includes several chapters (#45 – #51) dealing with the last of the givens of existence – freedom – and its corollaries: responsibility and decision-making.
Yalom understands freedom in the way most existential philosophers understand it: as a way of assuming responsibility for your life in a chaotic, unstructured world.
So as to help your patients achieve this, never reinforce victimhood – even if nine-tenths of the bad things that happened to them are someone else’s fault, focus on the one-tenth in which their actions mattered.
 is also glanced upon since it is another boundary experience, located somewhere between freedom and death.
You’re free to make a decision, but that usually means 
making some other decision which means that you’re willingly cutting yourself off from other possibilities.
That’s where anxiety stems from – and therapists need to deal with this appropriately.
Everyday Therapy (52 – 76)
The third section (#52 – #76) is, not even arguably, the most random one.
Here, interspersed with examples from his own clinical practice, you’ll find many useful pieces of advice regarding numerous different aspects of psychotherapy.
Here they are:
#52. Conduct therapy as a continuous session;
#53. Take notes of each session;
#54. Encourage self-monitoring: may your patients take notes as well;
#55. When your patient weeps, encourage him to go even deeper;
#56. Give yourself some time for repose between patients;
#57. Express your dilemmas openly with the patient;
#58. When you can, do home visits;
#59. Don’t take explanations too seriously;
#60. Use therapy-accelerating devices such as the “Who am I” question;
#61. Consider therapy a dress rehearsal for life;
#62. Use complaints as leverages;
#63. Don’t be afraid of touching your patient;
#64. However, unlike Jung, never be sexual with patients;
#65. Look for anniversary and life-stage issues;
#66. Never ignore ‘therapy anxiety;’
#67. Ask your patient what you should say to make him feel better;
#68. Love and therapy are incompatible: “the good therapist fights darkness and seeks illumination, while romantic love is sustained by mystery and crumbles upon inspection;”
#69 – #73. When in need, systematically collect the history of your patient, including interviewing his/her significant other and exploring previous therapy;
#74. Share the 
 with your patient;
#75. Freud was wrong about many things – but he was not always wrong;
#76. Don’t be afraid of the EVT (empirically validated therapy) bogeyman. 
Dreams (77 – 83)
Next on Yalom’s agenda: the interpretation of dreams.
Of course, he advises therapists to use dreams in their sessions; however, he’s not that keen on a deep, full interpretation such as the 
.
Use dreams pragmatically: first master some dream navigational skills, then pay attention to the narrative and then pillage and loot through them!
Hazards and Privileges (84 – 85)
In the last two chapters, Yalom unearths the occupational hazards and privileges of being a therapist.
As far as the former ones are concerned, you need to be careful of a few dangers:
• First of all, you need to try hard not to isolate yourself from others: therapists are sometimes just too solitary creatures;
• Secondly, find nourishment in your friends and family; otherwise, you’ll too become anxious and confront problems;
• Nevertheless, be aware that some patient difficulties can – and sometimes 
– disrupt your life and may cause relationship strains and even thoughts of suicide;
• If so, attend support groups for therapists: apparently, this exists as well.
Why bother being a therapist if this is the cost?
Well, Yalom has an answer for that in the final chapter:
Key Lessons from “The Gift of Therapy”
1.      Existential and Group Therapy
2.      The Four Givens of Existence
3.      Therapists Are Descendants of Jesus and Buddha
Existential and Group Therapy
Irvin Yalom practices two types of therapy: existential and group therapy.
The former is reserved for individuals and is “a dynamic therapeutic approach that focuses on concerns rooted in existence;” it is based on the assumption that despair is the result of a personal confrontation with the givens of existence.
Group therapy is interpersonal and operates within the idea that patients “fall into despair because of their inability to develop and sustain gratifying interpersonal relationships.”
The Four Givens of Existence
According to existential psychotherapy, there are four givens of existence: death, isolation, meaning in life, and freedom.
These are the things everyone is explicitly or implicitly interested in; it is through an analysis of a subject’s relation to them that we can learn most about him or her.
Therapists Are Descendants of Jesus and Buddha
According to Irvin Yalom, therapists are privileged with hearing out the deepest and most intimate secrets of their subject; and they should act accordingly.

“Licensed to Lie PDF Summary”
is a sort of an autobiography by Sidney Powell, chronicling her loss of trust in the American justice system as witnessed by her firsthand during the trial of Jim Brown, an executive of Merrill Lynch, wrongly charged with assisting Enron in an accounting fraud.
And that’s merely the tip of the iceberg.
The Ultimate Toll
The story opens on September 26, 2010, on a typical autumn day in Washington, DC, during the season for “apples, sweaters, sweatshirts, and football games.”
Inside a completely unremarkable cottage located on 8
 Street Northwest, a guy named Nick Marsh decides that he is not that interested in watching football games anymore; so, around 2:00 PM, Nick takes a loose razor blade and slashes his left wrist; then he slashes his right.
Even though he feels faint and nauseous and is bleeding profusely, he is not sure that he has done enough damage; bleeding across the basement floor, he finds a power cord, ties it into a noose and hangs himself.
Even that is not enough: a few moments later, his wife finds him unconscious, bleeding, and hanging by the power cord, and calls 911.
They arrive too late: at around 2:30 PM, a DC coroner pronounces the 37-year-old Nick Marsh dead from asphyxiation.
Six weeks earlier, on August 9, 2010, former Senator Ted Stevens boards “a single-engine amphibious de Havilland DHC-3 Otter airplane for a day of Alaska’s finest fishing.”
Unfortunately, the plane never arrives at its final location: it crashes into a slope of a heavily forested mountainside.
Out of the nine people on board, five die, and four – including former NASA Chief Sean O’Keefe and his son Kevin – survive.
Unfortunately, Ted Stevens is not among the latter.
To anyone who watches the news from time to time and is older than 20, Ted Stevens is much more than just another name.
Because the breaking news that fateful evening of August 9 back in 2010 ran something like this over every single channel in the entire country:
FORMER SENATOR TED STEVENS, BELOVED CHAMPION OF ALASKA, HAS BEEN KILLED NEAR DILLINGHAM, ALASKA, IN THE CRASH OF A PRIVATE PLANE WHILE HE WAS ON A FISHING TRIP WITH LONGTIME FRIENDS
However, during the two years preceding this accident, Ted Stevens was somewhat less than beloved – even in his very own Alaska where he was considered all but a legend for most of his life.
One of the longest-serving U.S. Senator in history, Stevens was found guilty of all seven counts of making false statements (failing to report gifts properly) on October 27, 2008.
Just eight days later, Stevens was defeated by Mark Begich for the Senate seat by no more than 3,724 votes.
However, just a few months later, an FBI agent by the name of Chad Joy suggested that FBI agents and prosecutors may have intentionally withheld and concealed evidence which could have resulted in a “not guilty” verdict for Stevens.
It turned out that Joy was right: “the prosecutors from the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice had broken ethical rules,” reminds us Powell, “disregarded court orders, and violated constitutional law while they hid evidence favorable to his defense—called ‘Brady material.’”
Ted Stevens’ death renewed interest in both fabricating evidence and the prosecutorial and government misconduct during his trial.
And where’s Nick Marsh in the story?
You’ve guessed it alright:
He was one of the prosecutors in the elite Public Integrity Section of the Criminal Division of the US Department of Justice.
The Enron Debacle and the Arthur Andersen Conviction
Hold your horses: 
is not a book about Ted Stevens or Nick Marsh, and despite the thriller-like beginning, it is both much profound and, thus, inevitably more boring than 
.
However, much like 
, it is about a pattern of injustice and government misconduct which may have cost the lives and the sanity of thousands and thousands of people.
In fact, after the first chapter, 
delves deep into a long 200-page analysis of the Enron disaster of the 1990s, and particularly the prosecution of one Jim Brown of Merrill Lynch.
Why?
Well, because Powell was tasked with representing Brown in his post-trial defense.
By now, you certainly know a lot about 
.
America’s Most Innovative Company for six consecutive years, Enron was a giant in the energy business, employing over 30,000 people and claiming revenues of over $100 billion during 2000, the last year of its existence.
So, what happened?
The Enron scandal did, during which it was discovered that Enron’s financial condition didn’t really align with the actual facts.
And you know that this is a subtle euphemism for fraud; systematic, creative and institutionalized fraud.
However, asks Sidney Powell, do you know that almost every Enron-related conviction which has gone up on appeal has resulted in a complete or partial reversal?
Wait… 
?
!
Take Arthur Andersen, for example.
The only American company in the “Big Five” accounting firms – along with Netherlands-based KPMG and the British giants Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Ernst & Young) – back in 2001, Arthur Andersen was one of the world’s largest multinational companies.
Unfortunately, it was also the firm in charge of the Enron audit.
The result?
On June 15, 2002, Andersen was convicted of obstruction of justice: Nancy Temple (from Andersen’s legal department) and David Duncan (lead partner for the Enron account) had apparently ordered the shredding of Enron-related documents.
Despite employing close to 85,000 people, since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission doesn’t accept audits from convicted felons, the company had to be closed soon afterward.
And then, three years later in the case of 
, the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously reversed the conviction due to serious errors in the trial judge’s jury instructions.
Apparently, hungry for a conviction, the prosecutors had pieced together parts of different statutes to fabricate a crime and purged criminal intent from the jury instructions.
What about all those jobs, you ask?
Well, that’s what Powell is interested in as well.
Because while representing Jim Brown of Merrill Lynch, Powell had to deal with the very same pattern.
And it all started with a relatively small business transaction between the two conglomerates at year-end 1999: Merrill Lynch entered into a “best efforts” agreement with Enron over some Nigerian barges.
Better put, “Enron solicited – indeed pushed and cajoled – Merrill Lynch to invest $7 million cash to purchase a minority equity interest in a company that would profit from three electrical power barges stationed off the coast of Nigeria.”
Now, Enron held the majority interest and controlled the barge project. Supposedly, it had sent the barges to the Nigerian coast “to help the war-torn country with emergency electrical power” at the request from the US State Department.
On December 23, 1999, there was “a five-minute telephone conversation between Andrew Fastow (Enron’s chief financial officer), Jeff McMahon (Enron’s treasurer), Daniel Bayly of Merrill Lynch, and several others – but not Jim Brown.”
During this conversation, Fastow ensured McMahon that it “would use its best efforts and continue the process it had already started to remarket Merrill’s interest in the barges to another party within six months.”  
This was great, since, as Bayly made clear to Fastow, Merrill did not want to hold its equity in these barges very long.
The prosecutors, however – Andrew Weissman, Kathryn Ruemmler, Matthew Friedrich, and John Hemann – saw something much deeper and more sinister beneath this agreement.
According to them:
For Weissman, Ruemmler, Friedrich & Hemann “it didn’t matter that none of the Merrill defendants personally profited from this transaction. It didn’t matter that none engaged in any conduct that they thought was unlawful.” And it didn’t even matter that some people such as Jim Brown were not present during the phone call.
Simply put, all it mattered to them was that there was some kind of a conspiracy based on nothing more but a possible (and never proven) “secret oral side deal that Enron guaranteed to buy back the barges.”
This negated even the fact that the Merrill Lynch corporate counsel had approved the transaction: the prosecutors claimed that the Merrill executives had lied to their own lawyers and kept them in the dark about the real deal, the one not in writing. 
Epilogue
Do you even have to ask?
We started with a suicide and a lost election; we end, retroactively with hundreds of thousands of people left jobless, and the lives of quite a few innocent people irretrievably ruined.
And what about the prosecutors?
Well, you already know everything about two of them.
Kathryn Ruemmler, for example, who “plainly suppressed” evidence favorable to the defense in the Barge case became a partner at Latham & Watkins, then Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General at the Justice Department, and finally, White House counsel between 2011 and 2014.
Andrew Weissman fared, arguably, even better: after destroying Arthur Andersen and Merrill Lynch, Weissman became deputy director/general counsel of the FBI; in late 2013 he “quietly slipped from FBI to NYU,” and in June 2017, he was appointed as a member of the 2017 special counsel team headed by Robert Mueller.
And Sidney Powell?
 “As for me,” she writes:
Dear Sidney, after your book, we are as well.
Key Lessons from “Licensed to Lie”
1.      Prosecutors Don’t Care About Justice: They Care About Their Careers
2.      “The Best Lack All Conviction, While the Worst Are Full of Passionate Intensity”
3.      …and Justice for All
Prosecutors Don’t Care About Justice: They Care About Their Careers
As evidenced in many cases surveyed in Sidney Powell’s 
– the Enron scandal, the Andersen and Merrill Lynch convictions, the Ted Stevens debacle – prosecutors are often willingly and consciously hiding evidence in an attempt to win a case.
“Much more must be required,” writes Powell in the last paragraph of her book, “of those who have the honor, privilege, and responsibility of representing us in our courts. They hold in their hands the very lives of our citizens while they are entrusted with and wield the fearsome might and unbridled power of the Sovereign to seek Justice or deal egregious Injustice.”
“The Best Lack All Conviction, While the Worst Are Full of Passionate Intensity”
Unfortunately, prosecutors hiding evidence often end up being on the winning side: not just of a certain case, but of life as well.
Kathryn Ruemmler, for example, and Andrew Weissman, who destroyed companies and cost the jobs of hundreds of thousands of people by “plainly suppressing” evidence made it to the White House. 
Sidney Powell is furious:
Brady Disclosure… and Justice for All
As can be seen from these cases, even the rich are not safe from obstructions of justice – a dish best served to the poor and unguarded. 
Why?
Because if prosecutors want to achieve something, they have means to achieve it, and they usually don’t care how ethical or unethical these means are.
Don’t know if you know – we didn’t – but prosecutors have discretion with regard to the evidence they are obliged to provide to the defendants, i.e., they are the ones who decide which evidence is relevant to a defendant.
This, in effect, means that they are preparing his or her defense – which is not only unjust but also downright senseless.

Our Critical Review
We are not lawyers or that much interested in legal dramas but 
really held our attention from beginning to end.
The book “reads like a cross between investigative journalism and courtroom drama” (William Hodes) and it unearths the unethical behavior of numerous prosecutors – be they Republican or Democrat – harbored within the Department of Justice.
We applaud Powell for her courage and demand others to follow her lead and take a stand.
Highly recommended."

For those of you who don’t know, Nick Vujicic was born without limbs, and immediately faced his first big “If.”
Later in life, he will prove time and time again, that limitations exist only in the mind, as he scuba dives, jumps from an airplane, plays sports, holds speaking events, inspires, writes books, and more.
Let’s dive into it!
Who Should Read “Life Without Limits”? And Why?
Well, it would be totally imprudent to categorize this book, as we believe that it is suited for everyone.
You will be surprised by Nick’s determination and eagerness to defeat the odds and rise to the occasion despite what everyone else was saying.
We fully encourage you to take the time off, and have a glimpse into “
.”
About Nick Vujicic
Truthfully, there are no words to describe 
 and his life-endeavors…
On a personal note: He is one of the most inspiring and influential people currently on this planet. It’s not about what he’s doing, but how and why.
A shy boy, who turned into a sensation for millions of people across the globe.
Born without limbs, but with a pure heart that follows God.
“Life Without Limits PDF Summary”
You can’t just wait for a miracle to fall out of a clear blue sky, you got to get up and become one! Nick is regularly asked multiple questions along the lines of: 
?
People fail to realize that despite his physical limitations, Nick has been living the life of his dreams, no excuses, no mantras, no sorry, only cheerfulness. In his words, happiness can only be reached when you accept the imperfect version of yourself.
For those of you that don’t know, Nick Vujicic was born without limbs but has decided to embrace life as it is.
As we continue down this path, it’s crucial to give a second thought to your “supposed” limitations.
God has created us under the notion of free choice, which means you are entitled to choose whatever life you so desire.
If dejection is what you settle upon then, that’s what you’ll get.
However sad and shallow life may seem at a given point, there’s always this one thing called – hope, lurking beneath the surface.
To illustrate the real meaning of life, Nick Vujicic shared his parents’ birth-experience with their first child – him.
During the pregnancy, Nick’s mom was told that everything is going smooth and there’s no reason to be worried about anything.
But then all of a sudden, dead silence came to pass as the doctors laid eyes upon the baby.
Dushka Vujicic, being a nurse herself, knew that something is wrong when they escorted Nick’s dad out of the room.
Later on, they told them that their son was born with Phocomelia.
It was a big shock, and everyone started crying, including the nurses. His parents were not keen to lay out how it all turned out at the day of his birth but waited until Nick is old enough to be able to take it.
On his journeys, Nick often emphasizes the value of focusing on something you have, rather than on the things you don’t have at arm’s length.
When we want to 
, more suffering is what we usually come across.
A great paradox of human existence is that Nick’s parents worried that he was going to grow up without a future, and life will be too hard for him.
They even considered adoption but decided to raise him as best they could.
As a young infant, Nick was blessed for not knowing his state and the challenges that are yet to be revealed.
Nick would perform some crazy stunts including hauling himself into an upward position, which left his parents speechless.
Raising a child is by no means a picnic, but Nick always seemed to be eager to find a way on his own.
No doubt, life can sometimes seem like a mess but then again; try not to judge yourself too quickly if things don’t turn out as planned.
Remember, life is a marathon not a 100 meters sprint.
As you move along with the flow, your existence will start to reveal itself, like a butterfly ready to engage with the world.
Right about the time, Nick was fifteen years of age; he had felt this push towards God and asked for forgiveness. 
One time, Nick was preparing to give a speech at Knott
 in Anaheim, pretty close to his house.
The next moment, an older gentleman started shouting “Nick, Nick” to get his attention.
He pointed to a man sitting next to him that had a child. That man stood up, lifted the child above the crowd so that Nick could see him.
The boy also didn’t have any limbs. Upon laying eyes on him, Nick knew exactly what his parents are going through, and felt sorry for the boy’s “limitations” that will only amplify as it grows older.
Life without meaning is nothing and a complete waste of time.
Perhaps, if I can help this boy out a bit, then maybe he could overcome some of the challenges that I couldn’t in my early years – Nick thought to himself.
His parents might look for someone to share their burden with, and by burden, Nick means not the child, but the cruelties of today.
Nick knew that God was testing him; he knew that the boy brought to him was a sign of mercy, love, and faith.
Time and time again, Nick emphasizes the importance of the spirit, and how nothing can break it unless you allow it.
Hope appears with almost every breath, and this temporary life should not be taken for granted, to say the least.
Nick reckons that hope is tied to eternity and should be regarded as a test one must undergo in order to see the Godly grace.
God or this Universal force knows how much our hearts can bear, without exception; what sort of challenges should be put in front of them and why.
One of the best things you can do to ease off the burden is to talk to someone.
Nick admits that he doesn’t have all the answers, but when the lights go out, and darkness emerges, the pathway to salvation is harder to find. By nurturing a close relationship with the people you love and cherish, you can find compassion even in the most inhospitable environments.
In 2008, Nick embarked on an adventure to China and went to marvel at the beauties of this ancient country.
Later on, he saw a young Chinese girl whose eyes sprinkled with joy.
Nick found out that this girl, along with four thousand others were struck by an earthquake that decimated an entire region and left them homeless.
He was asked to speak in front of the kids of the orphanage, but he didn’t know how to raise their spirits. His team already packed up some stuff for them including blankets and clothing that will keep them warm during the winter.
Upon arriving at the orphanage, Nick was the one left speechless. One kid after another approached him, and hugged him, not saying a word.
A mind-boggling moment for him, indeed!
 (Full Assurance in the Heart) is difficult to grasp, especially to people who don’t believe in anything without seeing it. Living without faith and hope, as the Bible puts, loses its substance and meaning.
Sometimes by putting trust in something that is far beyond your level of understanding, you can achieve peace and comfort knowing that someone is watching out for you. 
Also, Nick doesn’t quite restrict the notion of 
, as he also endorses all other forms of establishing a spiritual bond. 
It goes without saying that FAITH must be tested before that person receives a shower of blessings.
Nick in this autobiographical spin of life, also reveals that when he was around the age of ten, he suffered from depression.
Constantly nagging yourself with thoughts of failure is merely the end result of focusing on the things you don’t have.
Nick puts it delicately – 
.
During a speaking event in Singapore, a distinguished gentleman approached Nick and asked for help. The man was what we usually call successful in the material sense, but had this gap in his personal life. He told Nick that his daughter who is 14 years old, feels intense dislike and hatred for her body and appearance.
Nick understood this man’s pain because there’s nothing more painful than seeing your child suffer.
God tells us that we are all wonderful and uniquely made. But sometimes, we find it hard to love ourselves for some vague and invalid reasons. Insecurities during this teenage period could induce lower self-esteem in advancing years, which could also lead to depression.
When you fall prey to “I am not good enough” mentality, you are both right and wrong.
So, Nick did a little test.
While addressing the crowd, he asked: 
?
Almost all of them raised their hands, but when he asked: 
?
Then, they realized how we all are judgemental to some degree, more or less. Don’t get it the wrong way; you are not required to seek love and acceptance from others but redirect that effort in building a strong inner bond with yourself.
Most of the time, we bury our beauty so deep within us, that any form of lightness that might announce itself is immediately stifled.
Through our own actions and mindset, we amplify even the less significant problems and make a big deal out of everything.
As imperfection kicks in, some of us can’t seem to cope with the idea of not having high stature in society.
Individuality is lost, faith is nowhere to be found, and the one thing we have left is dismay.
In all probability, even those people who appear perfect on the outside, have their flaws, shortcomings, and challenges. 
So many fearful and insecure people place emphasis on 
 rather than on 
? 
When we take a critical look at Nick Vujicic’s life, we’ll notice that God has endowed him with the courage to turn struggles into life-lessons!
Key Lessons from “Life Without Limits”
1.      Faith is what will get you through
2.      What God desires might not be what you seek
3.      Make the first step
Faith is what will get you through
Life is not milk and honey, and sometimes you have to count on the abstract to get the ball rolling. Of course, that’s easier said than done!
Nonetheless, bear in mind that without faith, you won’t make it!
What God desires might not be what you seek
Sometimes, what life has in store for us, is not in tune with what we want from life.
But, that doesn’t mean that our desires come without limitations. It’s your job to open your mind and allow possibilities to cross the threshold.
Make the first step
All the big talk count for nothing, if you are not inclined to take action.
Sitting and ruminating on something doesn’t yield positive results! Don’t worry about the rest of the journey; just take the first step.
You’ll see that life will open up a window of opportunity for you to exploit.

If, however, you are already deeply familiar with the lives of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and King George III and are not that keen on another story about the American Revolutionary War, then skip this one.
Unless you want to hear the same story retold in a new manner.

“Killing England PDF Summary”
’s POV
Published in 2017, 
 is the seventh book – out of eight as of 2019 – in Bill O’Reilly and Martin Dugard’s pretty famous (but appallingly and oftentimes “misnomerly” titled) 
series.
Those who have read even one of the relevant books in this series (
,
and especially
or
), already know the drill.
O’Reilly and Dugard’s starting position is usually “conservative America is the greatest country in the history of humanity,” and regardless of their focal point – 
 being the only exception – this is the point they are trying to make.
However, 
 does surprise here and there: in 35 chapters, the book retells the brutal (and all too familiar) struggle for American independence but in a sort of playful manner, through the eyes of 
 the leaders of the British Empire and the main figures from the American Revolution.
Since this makes King George III one of the main characters of the book – and since there are at least a few chapters when events are told through his point of view – Interestingly enough, 
offers (sometimes, at least) a more balanced and nuanced view of the American Revolution than many other US-centered and US-glorifying books available on the market.
’s Structure and Prologue
It is both fairly difficult and fairly easy to summarize this book: the latter because you can find every single event in every single history book you’ve ever happened upon, the former because of the structure of 
Namely, each of the chapters tends to focus on one figure and one day (the period is, of course, 1775-1783), both of which are revealed in the opening sentence of the said chapter.
The only exception is the “Prologue” which is situated in Ohio Country and starts at 1:30 pm on July 9, 1755, the last day of the life of Capt. Daniel-Hyacinthe-Marie Liénard de Beaujeu.
Why?
Because that is the day that one of the four main characters of 
, George Washington, then a volunteer in General Edward Braddock’s army, redeems his honor after surrendering to the French at Fort Necessity the previous year and the day he ceases being a surveyor and Virginia gentleman to become a warrior.
Interestingly enough, this happens in a defeat: Braddock is soundly defeated at the Battle of the Monongahela by a force of French and Canadian troops.
Captain Daniel Liénard de Beaujeu dies, but dies a victorious hero.
’s Story
Since it’s both impossible and impractical to tell the story of 
as it is told by O’Reilly and Dugard (jumping from a character to character from one to the next chapter), we’ll summarize it neatly grouping the narrative arcs via the four main characters of the book.
No need to tell you that the characters in question are: George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and George III.
After introducing us to the so-called Bradock’s Disaster and George Washington’s resignation from Britain’s military service, Dugard and O’Reilly jump two decades ahead (to June 16, 1775) and present the now 41-year-old Washington in a completely new light:
Nominated by Samuel and John Adams – to the utter joy of everyone present – Washington accepts this new title (Commander in Chief of the newly-formed Continental Army).
“As to pay, Sir,” he says in his acceptance speech, “I beg leave to assure the Congress, that, as no pecuniary consideration could have tempted me to have accepted this arduous employment, at the expense of my domestic ease and happiness, I do not wish to make any profit from it.”
The rest is (pretty known) history.
As the very first Commanding General of the United States Army, George Washington leads the Continental Army to many victories, most notably in the first battle fought after the Declaration of Independence and the largest one of the whole war (The Battle of Long Island), and, more importantly, the morale-boosting Surrender of Yorktown which prompts the British government to negotiate an end to the conflict.
No wonder Washington is still remembered as the “first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.”
 is just too colorful to be retold in a few hundred words – or even a few hundred pages, for that matter.
Justly considered “The First American” in history, Franklin was a polymath who was capable of turning into gold basically everything he would touch.
Known for inventing the Franklin stove, bifocals, and (most notably) the lightning rod, Franklin was everything from a leading author to a publisher, from a still-quoted physicist to one of the foremost scientists of his time, from a smart politician to a Grand Master Freemason.
As far as America’s efforts to kill England, for the most part of his life, he was impartial and pacifistic. “In England,” he wrote describing the effects of this, “I am accused of being too much an American, and in America of being too much an Englishman.”
O’Reilly and Dugard follow Benjamin Franklin from his ambassadorship day to France through his change of mind in relation to the new country to his career as the first United States Postmaster General. 
However, O’Reilly and Dugard don’t shy away from portraying Ben Franklin’s dark side as well, as well as his reputation as a sort of a ladies’ men.
This, of course, means that Benjamin Franklin wasn’t that great of a husband or a father, and 
uncovers quite a few interesting events related to this side of “the most accomplished American of his age.”
Here’s an interesting bit (you probably already know): Benjamin Franklin’s illegitimate son William fought for England because he hated his father more; in addition, he exiled himself after learning that Benjamin Franklin planned to arrest him.
Needless to add, the two never spoke again after this.
Understandably and quite expectedly, Thomas Jefferson’s narrative arc mostly focuses on him writing the Declaration of Independence.
As everybody knows, he was recommended to do that by John Adams, whose reasons to choose Jefferson before him were threefold:
• First of all, unlike Adams who was from Braintree, Massachusetts, Jefferson was a Virginian, “and a Virginian ought to appear at the head of this business;”
• Secondly, USA’s third president was everything the country’s second president was not, in Adams’ words 
 an “obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular” person;
• And thirdly and more importantly, in Adams’ words, Jefferson could write ten times better than him.
In retrospect, it seems that Adams was right on at least this last account: the Declaration of Independence is one of the pinnacles of elegant political writing, and its preamble is, by all accounts, one of the highlights in humanity’s history:
“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”
About that “all men are created equal” part…
Thomas Jefferson was a fairly rich slaveowner who most probably fathered six children with one of his slaves, a mixed-race woman named Sally Hemings, born four decades after USA’s third president.
Well, it seems that 
 was right: some humans are created 
 equal than others.
 surprises the most in its pretty neutral representation of King George III of the United Kingdom.
George was merely 22 years old when he was coronated in 1760, and ruled England during the most tumultuous times of its glory years as a colonial superpower.
England was already in war with (mainly) France for global military and political primacy at the time of his coronation and, in 1763, after the Treaties of Paris and Hubertusburg, Britain’s victory in the Seven Years’ War was joyously celebrated on the American continent.
Hell, we’ll go even further than that: George III was celebrated as a hero, and the future Americans reveled in the fact that they were citizens of the world’s greatest and most powerful empire.
However, Britain’s victory came at a hefty price: according to George Grenville, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Britain’s budget deficit in 1763 was in excess of £122 million.
And America was just too big and attractive place to collect new taxes.
Of course, the Americans (especially the three guys from the chapters above) didn’t share this opinion with King George III (they believed they were British and, thus, have the same rights as the English) and that’s how the American War for Independence broke out.
Even though some historians accuse King George of fighting too long a lost war, O’Reilly and Dugard are far more sympathetic: he was just doing what his position demanded him to do.
And until the Siege of Yorktown, many still believed in a British victory.
However, that didn’t happen, and George accepted the defeat.
“I was the last to consent to the separation,” he told John Adams in 1785, “but I would be the first to meet the friendship of the United States as an independent power.”
Postscript
includes a long postscript in which the later days of most of the characters mentioned in the book are related.
The final paragraph, as if a before-credits title card, reveals neutrally and chillingly the numbers and figures of the American War of Independence:
Key Lessons from “Killing England”
1.      The American War of Independence Was Not Inevitable
2.      Benjamin Franklin’s Son Fought Against His Father
3.      Thomas Jefferson Fathered Six Children with His Wife’s Half-Sister
The American War of Independence Was Not Inevitable
Even though, in retrospect, one could argue that it was inevitable that it would happen sooner or later, it seems that Britain’s bad tax strategy is to blame for the American Revolutionary War.
Not only most of the Americans rejoiced after Britain won the Seven Years’ War against France in 1763, but also some of the leaders of the American Revolution – such as, say, Benjamin Franklin – were firmly against independence not that long before the war broke out.
Benjamin Franklin’s Son Fought Against His Father
In matters public and intellectual, Benjamin Franklin was the foremost American of his time; however, as far as his personal life is concerned, he was quite the Casanova with the ladies and quite the Darth Vader with his illegitimate son William.
William hated him so much, in fact, that he fought 
 America during the War for Independence and exiled himself after Benjamin wanted to arrest him for that.
Thomas Jefferson Fathered Six Children with His Wife’s Half-Sister
Thomas Jefferson may have written the most famous line in American history – “all men are created equal” – but he didn’t practice it in his personal life.
On the contrary, he was a slave owner and, moreover, he fathered six children with one of his slaves, a mixed-race woman by the name of Sally Hemings.
To make matters even worse, Sally was basically a half-sister of Jefferson’s first and only wife, Martha.

is her debut book.
“Dreamers PDF Summary”
Reminiscent of Suketu Mehta’s 
, Snigdha Poonam’s debut, 
 is both a well-timed and massively important study of Indian youth – for reasons stated in full in the “Some Stats Beforehand” chapter of our summary below.
In short, regardless of what you think, chances are that what happens in India at the present moment would inevitably shape the future of the whole world – Poonam explicitly states that: “the world’s future depends on young Indians meeting their aspirations” – and 
is a collection of seven case studies which show both the bright and the dark side of India’s youth.
It is a book about dreamers and realists, about wide-eyed secularists and close-minded cow-protectors, about liberals and conservatives – all of them embracing unprecedented liberty in all forms and manners; and it is a masterpiece of “long form” journalism.
Some Stats Beforehand
“More than half of India’s population is under the age of twenty-five,” writes Poonam in the first chapter of 
. “is the largest number of young people of any country on earth.”
In numbers, this amounts to about 600 million people, twice the size of the USA, making India’s twenty-something the biggest generation in the history of human civilization.
“Never before have there been so many young people,” a 2014 UN report notes in an overwhelmed tone. “Never again is there likely to be such potential for economic and social progress. How we meet the needs and aspirations of young people will define our common future.”
Of course, in more manners than one, 
; the result: if India doesn’t solve some of its big economic problems, then there’s a high chance that this generation will not only be “a scarred generation,” but also “a generation lost in space.” 
And neither a single country – nor the world in its entirety – can (and, more importantly, 
) afford so much wasted human potential!
India’s problems are known and are referred to as the 3E problems; in the case of its youth, this means that the majority of India’s 600 million people are either uneducated, unemployed, or unemployable.
In numbers: only 17% of India’s graduates (not even one-fifth of the whole bunch) are immediately employable. Meaning: India needs to immediately find a way to educate about 87% of its youth! 
To put things in context, about 80% of Japan’s workforce and 96% of South Korea’s has undergone formal skills training.
The solution: at least 1,000 universities and nearly 50,000 colleges will need to be built in the next decade!
Need some more context: the USA has a total of 4,200 colleges!
Part I: ‘There Is No Plan B’
But not everything is as bleak: in the first three chapters of 
,
Singdha Poonam relates three success stories about three people who did find a way to make themselves a life and acquire a social position far beyond the constraints of their family backgrounds or education. 
The people – Vinay Singhal, Moin Khan, and Pankaj Prasad – have found a way not only to use each and every one of the opportunities offered by this 
, but they have also successfully created an environment in which many others thrive alongside them.
Their dreams know no limits, and their aspirations go way beyond India’s needs.
In the first chapter, Poonam shares the story of WittyFeed, “one of the world’s fastest growing content farms.” 
Nobody would blame you if this is the first time you ever hear its name, but, just to put things in context, WittyFeed is followed by over a 
 people on Facebook, making BuzzFeed the only website of its kind visited by more people.
And it’s only a matter of time – according to WittyFeed’s founders, just a couple of years – before BuzzFeed is dethroned by this unknown company, run by 24-year-old Vinay Singhal and his two years younger brother Parveen in Indore.
Though they were born in a small village in Haryana, they dreamed big ever since their childhoods and hoped to change India for the better.
However, neither of their first two attempts to do that really came into fruition; but then, via Facebook, they realized that people were craving for “junk food for the brain” and they started a site under the maxim “it’s emotion that goes viral.”
Instead of informing India’s youth about 
, they are now producing content under catchy titles such as “Why your best friend is your true love, just like Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher” and “This is what you need to know about Amanda – Justin Bieber’s new girlfriend” – and are winning over the world, especially the US.
In fact, over 80 percent of the 82 million people who visit the site monthly are foreigners, and half of them are Americans.
However, Vinay Singhal’s dreams are still as big as Elon Musk’s: “I want to lead humanity,” he says to Poonam. “Humanity is bigger than a country. I want to go outside the earth. I want humanity to be a multi-planetary existence. I want to lead Mars.”
The second story of 
 introduces us to a less extravagant and more rounded character, probably the most subtle one in the whole book.
His name?
Moin Khan.
Born into a poor family – its income came from their two cows, and Moin spent most of his childhood delivering milk from one doorstep to another – Khan was hardly a man one could call educated even in his teenage years.
After all, unlike Vinay Singhal, he didn’t even have the chance to study, i.e., he was “not in a position to waste precious daylight in a classroom.”
So, he didn’t: he enrolled in a local college where he had to show up once a year: for the annual exam.
But then, after he grew tired of selling things (“firewood, toys, anything”), Khan developed an interest in getting a respectable job and some money.
And there was only one he could land without taking an entrance examination: at a call center, “the ultimate cheat’s guide to the white-collar world” for many Indians.
In case you didn’t know – but you do – India houses more than half of the world’s call center market. 
Already by 2006, “when Moin Khan heard his first-ever burst of spoken English by making a customer service call on a borrowed cell phone,” over 2 million Indians were employed in the call center industry.
Moin Khan’s opportunity was a direct product of the market needs: he belongs to the first generation of non-English speakers trained to speak English as if they knew the language.
A decade later, Khan is a teacher of Spoken English at the American Academy.
Now at 27, he prepares other young men to follow in his footsteps; they all believe that, even though legacy of an 
, English is their way out of poverty and disrespect.
The third guy we meet in Snigdha Poonam’s 
is Pankaj Prasad, a sort of a middleman between the “intimidating,” “inscrutable,” and “inaccessible” government (
) and the ordinary people of India.
“The gap between the regular Indian and Sarkar is widest at the very bottom,” writes Poonam, “where the government deals with the people least aware of what they are owed… The execution of welfare policies is… tedious; it requires a mastery of paperwork and the energy to run between government departments. Most ordinary people leave it to a fixer.”
Well, Pankaj Prasad is exactly that: a fixer, or “pyraveekar” in Urdu, the link between the poorest and the administration, someone who’s undeniably corrupt but essential as well.
“Rural fixers,” say Poonam, “have been around in India for as long as anyone has tried to govern the lives of villagers. It is, in fact, one of the most lucrative career options available in an Indian village.”
So, what’s the difference between the Generation Y youngsters and the 
 of yore?
Well, unlike their predecessors, Prasad and those like him know that the government needs them more than they need the government.
That’s why, Prasad:
Part II: ‘I Am Ready for a Fight’
Let’s face it: as it stands, India is not a success story; if it had been, it would have been a superpower, the third one in addition to USA and China, if not the one even these two countries look up to. 
However, India is still a country where for every success story such as the three in Part I, there’s a frustrated one, such as these in Part II, and an unsuccessful one – such as the two in Part III.
In “The Angry Young Men,” Poonam introduces us to a range of Hindu nationalists and Hindutva extremists, poetically referred to as saffron terrorists by many newspaper outlets.
However, there’s absolutely nothing poetic about the things they are interested in: whether they are members of the Cow Protection Army or merely self-proclaimed saviors, these men think they have figured out the right way for a human being to live his/her life and are interested into demonstrating this to anyone who has wandered off.
The 
– aka, the Cow Protection soldiers – are “the most feared men in India” right now; they live out Hollywood movies driving cars with guns in their hands, and waging a holy war against the murderers of holy animals.
Their logo?
The gilded torso of a cow bordered by AK-47s and a pair of swords.
Ever since the election of Narendra Modi’s BJP in 2014, there has been a severe rise in cow-protection violence in India; in fact, just during the last few years, at least 30 people have been lynched (most of them Muslims) and around 125 have been injured by 
.
Arjun Kumar is not one of them, but that doesn’t stop him from thinking that he’s here on Earth to introduce some holy order in the grand scheme of things.
A member of the militant Bajrang Dal, he is one of many young Hinduists roaming India who hates unmarried couples so much that he spends Valentine’s Day chasing them with an iron rod: 
Sometimes, it gets even worse: activists of Bajrang Dal have been known to force unmarried couples to tie rakhis or apply sindors against their will, thus, essentially forcing them to marry.
Notice the singular in the title: there are many angry young men in the previous chapter, but Snigdha Poonam has opted for a single angry young woman here.
Her name is Richa Singh, the only heroine of 
.
Her achievement?
Becoming a president of the Allahabad University Students’ Union.
Well, that’s not really something, you’d think!
However, as Poonam states, this is “one of the most important elections in Uttar Pradesh,” comparable to “the one to the assembly in Lucknow or to the Parliament in Delhi.”
“The election to the students’ union of Allahabad University,” Poonam goes on, “doesn’t just decide which student party gets to call the shots in the campus – and by extension the city – but is also known as the most reliable indicator of wider political currents.”
But even then – it seems as if nothing special.
And yet it is: never, in the history of Allahabad University, has a woman been elected to the Students’ Union, let alone becoming its president.
Why?
Well, read the previous chapter yet again: guys like Arjun Kumar (or the unmentioned Vikas Thakur or Sachin Ahuja) have a vision of what a lady is supposed to do and look like, and, these are not 
However, Richa Singh decided to take on the upper-caste Hindutva extremists and the patriarchy of the University – and won.
And as the president, she resisted the ABVP and two years before he became the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Singh managed to stop Yogi Adityanath from entering the campus of Allahabad University.
.
You go, girl!
Part III: ‘Nothing Is What It Looks Like’
Sometimes things are not as great as they seem at first sight: the last part of Poonam’s book tells two stories which reveal the dark interior beneath the shiny surface. 
In “The Star,” Poonam introduces us to Azhar Khan – but not the one you know as 
Nope: this Azhar Khan still dreams of becoming someone as famous as the first one. 
And at the age of 21, after winning the first “Mr. Jharkhand” pageant, it must have seemed to Azhar that his dreams are not unrealistic: if not a Hollywood darling, he was destined to become a Bollywood star.
Like his role model John Abraham, Azhar Khan planned to start with modeling and use this as a springboard to a film career. 
And for a while, he was the king of the world: he won a prize, took part in a few modelling sessions, and was wanted by some important people; he even had a beautiful girlfriend for a week or two.
But then everything went downhill.
After learning that he had won a prize (the inevitable price of being famous, ha?), some people started asking him to pay out his debt to them, which Khan had amassed because of a few failed business ventures (selling shirts and running a fast-food restaurant) from the time before he became a local TV star.
To make matters worse, suddenly his brother lost his job, so Azhar was stuck with working to pay off this debt; eventually, he had to apply for a loan so that he could set up an enterprise to earn the necessary money.
In the end, Azhar Khan had no option but to run away to Mumbai and find support there from his now-few Facebook followers.
“The Scammer” is Snigdha Poonam at her investigative best: to understand what’s happening on the other side of India’s booming call center industry, she went undercover as a job aspirant, interviewing four times for a single job without even knowing what she would be selling if she ever got in.
And the things she found out?
As widely suspected and even more widely known, some of these call centers weren’t call centers at all, but double-dealing and extortion schemes committing various kinds of fraud against naïve American citizens. 
The worst kind of way to earn money.
But, in the India of today, sometimes it’s either that or absolute poverty.
Epilogue
In the “Epilogue,” Snigdha Poonam informs us where the people mentioned in the seven chapters of her book are now and what this means in relation to India’s present and its future.
And, in a way, we realize that she has already written out the conclusion of 
in the first chapter of the book:
Key Lessons from “Dreamers”
1.      India’s Generation Y, the Biggest Generation in History
2.      The 3E Problems: India and Its Young People
3.      The Future of the World Depends on the Young Indians of Today
India’s Generation Y, the Biggest Generation in History
Over half of India’s population is under the age of 25.
Meaning: there are 600 million young Indians treading the Earth in this very moment, making India’s Generation Y the biggest generation in all of human history.
And they are either destined for greatness or utter failure.
The 3E Problems: India and Its Young People
India’s Generation Y has been dubbed “scarred generation” by the International Labor Organization. 
The reasons?
Due to India’s economic problems, about 87% of the young Indians are either uneducated, unemployed, or unemployable.
For comparison, in Japan and South Korea it is the other way around: no more than one-fifth of Japan’s population and merely 4% of South Korea’s workforce 
highly skilled.
The Future of the World Depends on the Young Indians of Today
Even though it is “a pipe dream at this point,” Snigdha Poonam believes that “the world’s future depends on young Indians meeting their aspirations.”
The sheer number of them reveals the magnitude of their potential.
However, that very number is the problem: in the next decade, India will need to build 1000 universities and at least 50,000 colleges to educate about 100 million people.
And that’s something that’s never been done.
The result?
Unfortunately, as an 
 review states, “If young Indians really are changing the world, it may not be for the better.”

Do you have – or know someone who has – thyroid issues?
Are you willing to try alternative methods to fix them?
Then, 
is the book for you.
Who Should Read “Medical Medium Thyroid Healing”? And Why?
We’ve already summarized quite a few popular medical books on our site, some of which we had no option but to label as “unscientific;” well, this one falls under the same category.
Apparently, there are testimonials from people who say that the methods in this book have helped them, but, as always, we are skeptical. 
So, read this book only if you have thyroid issues and want to try alternative methods; otherwise, trust your doctor.

“Medical Medium Thyroid Healing PDF Summary”
Anthony William, the Medical Medium
“What will you find in this jewel of a book?” asks Prudence Hall, M.D., in the first sentence of the “Foreword” to 
And she instantly gives a straightforward answer: “A fascinating and innovative approach to thyroid disease.”
How could it not be?
For one, the author of the book is a self-proclaimed medical medium!
And that means exactly what you’d think it means: when he was just four years old, Anthony William was visited by the “Spirit of the Most High, God’s expression of compassion.” 
To the surprise and shock of his parents, he revealed to him that his symptomless grandmother is suffering from lung cancer, which medical studies later confirmed.
Ever since then, this Spirit speaks into William’s ears as if one would speak to a friend, filling him in on the symptoms of everyone around him.
Plus, according to William, this Spirit has taught him from an early age to see physical scans of people, “like supercharged MRI scans that reveal all blockages, illnesses, infections, trouble areas, and past problems.”
In other words, he’s both Dr. House from the future and that guy from that 
episode: he sees you, and he knows what you’re up against.
His job?
To tell you the truth where science can’t.
“To go with the facts and figures about thyroid illness in the pages to come,” he writes, “you won’t find citations or mentions of scientific studies that have spawned from unproductive sources. You don’t need to worry that this information will be proven wrong or superseded, as you do with other health books, because all of the health information I share here comes from a pure, untampered with, advanced, clean source – a higher source: the Spirit of Compassion. There’s nothing more healing than compassion.
The Great Mistakes: What Your Thyroid Issues Are Not
According to Anthony William, “science and the thyroid remain very distant from each other in this day and age.”
And this division is best-evidenced in the lack of a unifying explanation of people’s thyroid issues; William considers all of the nine currently accepted as “possible causes” for thyroid-related diseases as myths.
However, be aware that William doesn’t really have counter-arguments in more than one of the below cases; he thinks he knows better than all of these medical scientists because he converses with a Spirit from the future who has revealed to him that none of these theories are correct.
And you can either believe him or not: his claims are unfalsifiable and would hardly survive more than a second 
.
According to William, the very idea of autoimmune diseases (aka “a condition arising from 
 to a normal body part”) is preposterous.
How can the body attack itself? – William shrieks in disgust.
The very word “autoimmune,” writes William, is “a misnomer that means we can’t even talk about the truth of autoimmune disease without perpetuating the misunderstanding.”
“A more fitting term,” he goes on, “would be 
, because the immune system is going after invaders.”
In other words, even though there are at least 80 types of known autoimmune diseases, William firmly believes that our bodies never attack themselves; they solely go after pathogens.
The reason why doctors 
 in autoimmune diseases is because “frustrated with not having an explanation for why conditions such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, Graves’ disease, lupus, RA, Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, and MS were leaving people ailing or even crippled,” the doctors from the 1950s invented the idea of the body attacking itself.
According to William, “there are a minimum of 5,000 health issues that are still a mystery to medical science today.”
And one of the greatest mysteries of the medical sciences: chronic illnesses.
In other words, even though the doctors are “some of the smartest, most honest people around,” they are working within a “broken system” which teaches them to not be puzzled by many diseases which, in truth, are unexplained and still bewildering.
However, “acting as though migraines, depression, Lyme disease, RA, fatigue, Candida, hot flashes, heart palpitations, diabetes, and so many other problems aren’t baffling to experts is like ignoring the iceberg that the 
’s about to strike.”
“This holds true for all the Great Mistakes,” William makes a self-referential point; “pretending they aren’t there doesn’t make them less of a hazard.”
You know how uncomfortable you feel when you’re in a relationship with someone, but all you can put as your Facebook status is “it’s complicated”?
Well, the same holds true for doctors – or for any other human profession, for that matter!
In other words, we don’t want to deal with the unexplained or the inexplicable; so, we usually put labels and feel a lot more comfortable afterward.
However, if you have ever watched 
, we’re pretty sure that by now you know for a fact that putting a 
 label over something is much more dangerous than not putting any label.
Unfortunately – we can’t stress this enough – most doctors are working within a system which forces them to put labels even when they are not so sure.
“Inflammation” is another label, and one of those which get thrown around just too liberally for William’s taste.
“You see inflammation deemed to be the cause of everything from cancer to obesity to heart disease, and it’s a huge topic in thyroid illness and autoimmune disease,” writes William.
And true, almost everywhere you turn, foods and supplements are being advertised as anti-inflammatory and 
 advice against eating some foods because they are inherently inflammatory.
The problem?
Gluten, grains, wheat, etc. cause problems in some people, but not in others.
The reason?
According to William, that only the first group of people is susceptible is because they harbor in their bodies viruses which feed on the grains and fungi, resulting in inflammation.
Once again, inflammation is a label which hides the real cause: viruses.
You’ve heard this so many times: someone can’t lose weight, and someone else blames it on their slow metabolism; someone else is in tiptop shape, and a third person says that it’s all because of his/her fast, healthy metabolism.
News flash: metabolism is just another label which actually hides the real problems.
Metabolism isn’t “the driving force of mystery weight issues,” and neither is responsible for many autoimmune diseases.
However, it’s a word that’s been just 
accepted to be easily dismissed.
It should be, says William.
Science (
) would beg to differ, but Anthony William thinks that “we can’t be fooled into thinking genes mean 
:”
William calls the Unforgiving Four “the four outside factors that are the real problems behind chronic and mystery illness,” and considers it a Big Mistake on our part to ignore them.
The Unforgiving Four are the viral explosion, radiation, 
, and toxic heavy metals.
Even though William ascribes only about 5% of thyroid issues to the last three (see below), we kind of agree with the essence of this one.
Neither of these should be ignored; and, as far as we know, nobody has ignored either of these Four Unforgiving Outside Factors for at least half a century.
“I hope to God that this becomes a mistake of the past soon,” writes Anthony William in relation to Great Mistake #8, i.e., “It’s All in Your Head.”
And he’s right yet again: not very few doctors, after being unable to find any symptoms or reach conclusive results via science-backed tests, start convincing their patients that “it’s all in their heads.”
The truth is, as developed science is, sometimes it just doesn’t have the answers or the tests to discover the real problems.
And, 
, “reports about sensations and feelings are incorrigible.” 
“You created your illness,” writes Anthony William, “is a new, hip, repackaged version of ‘It’s all in your head.’”
It’s as unscientific as saying that 
 through the power of your mind; because, after all, if you can create a disease by merely thinking too forcefully that you have it, then why shouldn’t you be able to heal it through the very same method?
Once again, William is more than right.
The True Cause of Thyroid Issues
According to Anthony William – and, as the subtitle suggests, this is the main idea of this book – the true cause of all thyroid problems is a virus, more specifically, the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). 
William calls the EBV the “thyroid virus” for the simple reason that he believes it is responsible for 95% of all thyroid problems.
“The other 5 percent of thyroid problems,” he writes, “come from radiation exposure due to chest, dental, and other X-rays; CT scans; food and water supply contamination; plane travel; cell phones; inheritance of our parents’ and grandparents’ exposure; and the continuous atmospheric radiation fallout from past nuclear disasters.”
According to William, the EBV has four stages, and medical communities know only about two of them: the baby stage (when the virus is dormant or quietly replicating), and the war stage (when the EBV evolves into mononucleosis and some minor diseases).
However, it is the third stage, aka “the thyroid stage” which is really the problem and the phase in which the virus evolves into most of the diseases which are stated in the subtitle of William’s book.
Stage four is “the mystery illness stage,” aka “the one that results the most in sufferers feeling or being told that they are crazy, lazy, liars, and/or delusional.”
In other words, almost everything from fatigue and despondency to Hashimoto’s and Graves’ to fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis (MS) to ADHD and depersonalization is caused by the EBV attacking your thyroid (or other organs) at a different stage of development.
The problem is, stage three and stage four are undetectable by current testing methods, so doctors and people think that it’s autoimmune or mysterious diseases they’re dealing with.
William’s Spirit says: 
!
It’s EBV.

Thyroid Myths: The Great Mistakes in Your Way
Despite his sincere admiration for medical scientists, medical medium Anthony William claims that they’ve gotten everything wrong as far as thyroid-related diseases are concerned.
And he dedicates the second part of his book to debunking the many (in his opinion) myths surrounding these diseases, calling them the great mistakes of medical science.
#1. Autoimmune Confusion
#2. Mystery Illness Misconception
#3. Labels as Answers
#4. Inflammation as Cause
#5. Metabolism Myth
#6. Gene Blame Game
#7. Ignoring the Unforgiving Four
#8. It’s All in Your Head
#9. You Created Your Illness
According to Anthony William, neither of these is the true explanation behind your thyroid issues.
The Real, True Cause of Thyroid-Related Diseases
In other words, regardless of whether you’re suffering from Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, Graves’ disease, hyper- or hypothyroidism, thyroid nodules, endometriosis, or even thyroid cancer, it all boils down to a single cause: the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
According to Anthony William, even though scientists believe that the EBV has only two stages, there are actually four, the second of which is mononucleosis and the third one the thyroid stage; William calls the fourth one mystery illness stage, and he may be one of the very few who knows anything about that since, in his words, “many people never reach this stage.”
Resurrect Your Thyroid: Foods and Supplements 
In 
, William goes into great detail about what foods to include and what foods to avoid if you want to heal your thyroid.
The trick (of course) is to 
 give the EBV anything it wants and to include in your daily intake the foods and supplements that could kill it.
And, apparently, the EBV really likes eggs, cheese, and gluten; and it really hates artichokes. Other foods which starve EBV include apples, avocados, bananas, coconuts, dates, figs, garlic, ginger, lemons, mangoes, nuts, oranges, etc. etc.
As far as supplements are concerned, among many other things, use vitamin B
, zinc, vitamin C, and spirulina (for some reason, preferably from Hawaii).

Our Critical Review
To our eyes, 
does not seem like a science-based or science-backed book – regardless of whether we’re talking about present-day or future-day science.
In other words, you’d be best off not even reading it, let alone actually using its advice; as Jennifer Gunter says, the minimum is that you’d waste money, “but there is great potential for harm with many of the therapies that are recommended and delays in diagnosis.”

The Automatic Millionaire Summary
The Book at a Glance
If the title isn’t already a giveaway to you, 
is a practical guide to getting rich (and retiring early). 
However, unlike other similar manuals, this one boasts a very unique philosophy, one that can be described in seven points, the first three of which startle at first glance:
#1. You don’t have to make a lot of money to be rich.
#2. You don’t need discipline.
#3. You don’t need to be “your own boss.”
Then, what do you need?
#4. Above all, you need an “automatic system” so you can’t fail.
#5. By using what the author terms as “The Latte Factor,” you can supposedly build a fortune on a few dollars a day.
Why?
Because, 
 and 
:
#6. Homeowners get rich; renters get poor. (Yes, this is still true.)
#7. The rich get rich (and stay that way) because they pay themselves first.
But let’s delve into David Bach’s philosophy a little more.
Chapter One: Meeting the Automatic Millionaire
To start with – it’s not exactly his: as he informs us in the first chapter of his book, the original automatic millionaires are Jim and Sue McIntyre.
The author met them when they came to him looking for financial advice; it ended up being the other way around.
You see, Jim and Sue McIntyre were in their early fifties when the meeting occurred, and they were readying themselves for retirement.
Wait… 
?
You haven’t heard the strangest part yet: Jim had never earned more than $40,000 a year!
Then how did he have $2 million on his bank account at 52?
Well, between working for their money and letting their money work for them, the McIntyres chose the latter.
“You know,” Jim said to David, “most people think that when they get their paycheck, the first thing they should do is pay all their bills – and then if there is anything left over, they can save a few dollars.”
“In other words, pay everyone else first and yourself last. Our parents taught us that to really get ahead of the game, you have to turn this around. Put aside a few dollars for yourself, THEN pay all your other bills.”
Originally, they started putting aside just 4 percent of their income, and they slowly raised the bar; at the time of the meeting, they were saving 15 percent.
Also, because they knew full well that homeowners are rich and renters poor, their first job was to buy a house; and to make a down payment, they gave up smoking and automatically repurposed the money for a home.
“Automatic” is the keyword here: to stay away from budgeting arguments (and put discipline out of the picture), the McIntyres set up a system which automatically distributed the funds.
Still confused?
Read ahead!
Chapter Two: The Latte Factor: Becoming an Automatic Millionaire on Just a Few Dollars a Day
The main lesson David Bach learned from the McIntyres is quite simple: “How much you earn has almost no bearing on whether or not you can and will build wealth.”
Why?
Because, more often than not, the more we earn, the more we spend.
Is there any way out?
Of course there is!
The author calls it the Latte Factor.
Even though by now it is already “an internationally recognized metaphor for how we dribble away what should be our fortunes on small things without ever really giving it much thought” – it makes sense to explain it here one more time.
Think of it this way: your average coffee shop latte costs about $3.5 which is, of course, nothing, but which, if considered as a daily cost, amounts to about $1,250 a year. If you are, like the McIntyres, a smoker as well – on average, $7 per day – that’s another $2,500 out of the yearly budget.
Now, over the past fifty years, the average prices on the stock market have gone by around 10 percent on a yearly basis.
Let’s say that instead of buying a Latte and a pack of cigarettes each day, you put those $10 aside and you invest them; at an annual return of 10%, that would result in more than $1 million dollars after 30 years!
In other words, your Lattes and your cigarettes are costing you an indescribably fabulous fortune!
Chapter Three: Learn to Pay Yourself First
David Bach has crunched the actual numbers and you know that math doesn’t lie: if you start saving merely $14 a day at 20, and you do that for 35 years straight, with a 10 percent interest rate (which is a conservative estimate), by the time you’re 55, you’ll be able to retire with a staggering fortune of $1,6 dollars.
However, the main thing you should learn here is that these $14 are a priority: you need to set them aside first and 
do everything else after.
Most people are actually doing it very wrong: it doesn’t make sense to first pay your taxes, rent, and insurance and then pay yourself; David Bach says: first, do the latter, and then the former.
Here’s what that means!
$14 a day equals to about $5,000 dollars a year.
Now, if you pay yourself after paying your taxes, and you’re like Jim McIntyre, and you earn about $40,000 a year, then you’ll be setting aside $5,000 dollars out of $28,000 (at a 30% tax rate), leaving you with $22,000 to spread across 12 months.
However, if you set a pre-tax retirement fund and automate the process of “Paying Yourself First,” then this money will only be taxed when you withdraw it, at a probably lower rate than the current one.
In numbers, $40,000 (your wages) – $5,000 (retirement money) = $35,000 (taxed money).
30% out of $35,000 is 10,500, leaving you with $24,500.
And $24,500 is $2,500 more than $22,000!
Over 35 years, that’s $87,500 more!
See: it makes 
 of financial sense to set up a pre-tax retirement account!
Chapter Four: Now Make It Automatic
“Maybe you’ve heard all this before,” writes David Bach at the beginning of Chapter 4, “and you already know what 
 Paying Yourself First costs you. Having this knowledge hasn’t changed your life before, so why should anything be different now?”
“Well,” he goes on, “the difference is, this time you’re going to take control. This time you’re going to Make It Automatic.”
There’s no getting around it – he says: “in order for Pay Yourself First to be effective, the process has to be automatic.”
Why?
Because people are not disciplined enough to follow a certain routine over longer periods of time; and machines do exactly 
: no excuses and no questions asked.
“Whatever you decide to do with the money you’re paying yourself,” concludes Bach, “you need to have a system that doesn’t depend on your following a budget or being disciplined.”
Simply put, if the money is automatically taken from you, you won’t be able to spend it.
In other (David Bach’s) words, if you want to make it work, you should:
• Make sure you’re signed up for your retirement account at work (or IRA or SEP IRA or One-Person 401(k)/Profit-Sharing Plan, depending on your situation);
• Decide how much you are going to contribute to your account each month (ideally, the maximum amount allowed).
• Decide how you want to invest your retirement contributions.
• Whatever type of account you open, arrange to have your contributions 
transferred into it, either through payroll deduction at work or an automatic investment plan run by the bank or brokerage firm where you’ve set up your retirement account.
Chapter Five: Automate for a Rainy Day
Of course, life doesn’t always work perfectly.
In fact, quite the opposite.
Oftentimes, people lose their jobs or have to deal with health problems (both their own or their loved ones) or even devastating natural disasters.
And, as they say, even though you should help for the best, you must always be prepared for the worst.
That’s why a pre-tax retirement fund is just one part of the story; the other is, of course, an emergency fund.
According to stats, the average American has less than three months’ worth of expenses saved up for emergencies.
Simply put, that’s not enough.
In fact, far from it!
An emergency fund should amount anywhere between 6- and 18-months’ worth of wages to actually be considered some kind of financial net.
Of course, with that amount of money saved up, there’s an added – and often underestimated – bonus: quality of life.
In other words, of course you’re going to work overtime to 
lose your job if you have only 3 months’ worth of savings aside! Have a year and a half, and you can say “no” when you think it is appropriate to say “no” – because, even in the worst-case scenario, you’ll certainly find a job in a few months (meaning: there will be still some money left in your emergency fund!)
So, what you should do?
Once again, 
 put aside 5 percent from every paycheck for an emergency fund; and don’t spend this money under no circumstance whatsoever – until you really, really need it!
Also, don’t keep it in a jar somewhere in your kitchen; invest it and see it grow with time.
Chapter Six: Automatic Debt-Free Homeownership
As we said above – and as Thomas Piketty demonstrated with authority – homeowners are rich; renters are poor.
The sad part?
Over their lives, renters usually pay other homeowners more than they would have paid to buy their own house!
In other words, it makes absolutely no sense to rent a house – make the decision to buy one as soon as possible.
Worried that something might go wrong?
Here’s a reassuring fact: only 2% of American homeowners are evicted for failing to pay off their mortgage!
“The secret to being an Automatic Millionaire is keeping it simple,” says David Bach. “So, here’s what you do. Find yourself that home you want and buy it.”
Next, get a 30-year mortgage and use an automatic biweekly payment plan to pay it down.
What’s a biweekly payment plan?
It’s one of the greatest financial tips you’ll ever hear: instead of making a monthly payment for your mortgage, split it down the middle and pay half every two weeks.
Now, there are 52 weeks a year, meaning, you’ll be making half-payments 26 weeks a year; that amounts to 13 monthly payments a year, i.e., you get a full year every 12 years.
In other words, you’ll pay out a 30-year mortgage about 3 years earlier at least.
And that’s not the only miracle!
The other is even better.
We’ll let David Bach explain it to you:
“Using a monthly payment plan to pay off a $250,000 30-year mortgage with an interest rate of 5 percent will cost you a total of $233,139.46 in interest charges over the life of the loan. On a biweekly basis, the same mortgage will cost you a total of just $188,722.13 in interest.”
In other words, switching to the biweekly plan will save you more than $44,000!
Chapter Seven: The Automatic Debt-Free Lifestyle
Easier said than done, right?
After all, how can you think about automatically setting aside funds for retirement or buying a house and making biweekly mortgage payments when you’re already in so much debt? 
Needless to say, debt is not compatible with being a wealthy person, let alone a millionaire. As we’ve learned from 
, the rich usually don’t act rich, i.e., they don’t go in debt to buy a new Porsche.
So, if you want to be a rich person, one of the first things you should do is get rid of your debts. And like everything else – you should do it automatically!
The process consists of several steps:
Whatever the advertisements say, they don’t exist to make 
rich but to bring more money to the banks which issued them;
This is especially important since credit card’s interest rates are usually very high – sometimes as high as 18%.
What this means, in reality, is that, if you only pay minimum monthly payments, you’ll probably pay in interest just as much as you’ve originally spent!
Now, if you threaten your credit card provider that you’re unhappy with their service and you want to switch, you’ll probably get a much lower interest rate on your debt.
Now, if your debt is spread across multiple accounts, try to move it all into one – preferably the one with the lowest rate.
If that is not possible, start paying off the cards one by one, starting with the one with the lowest ratio of outstanding balance to minimum payment.
And after you’re done DOLPing your credit card accounts – cancel all of them.
Step four is a simple decision: to devote half the money you Pay Yourself First to paying off your balance.
Finally, make it automatic, by arranging for your credit card company to debit that amount from your checking account each month.
Chapter Eight: Make a Difference with Automatic Tithing
“We make a living by what we earn,” said once Winston Churchill, “we make a life by what we give.”
“Becoming an Automatic Millionaire,” adds David Koch in arguably the strangest chapter of a book about becoming a millionaire ever, “is not simply about accumulating wealth. It’s also about relieving stress and worries about the future – about putting yourself in a place that enables you to enjoy life now as well as in the future.”
And a good way to make more sense of your current life is becoming a giver of money.
Yup, you’ve heard that right: Bach thinks that a part of the journey to becoming a wealthy person is deciding to give away some of your money to charity.
.
Why?
Let us list four reasons.
First of all, it will make you feel like a millionaire right away: it’s not like poor people give money to charity, right?
Secondly, you’ll hardly even notice it if you start with 1 percent of your salary; that’s basically no more than $30 if you earn $3,000 a month.
Thirdly, charitable donations are tax-deductible, which means that it’s even less than $30 in the long run.
And finally – and most importantly – giving
away money will make you feel a lot better feeding you with the necessary energy and joy to live a better life on a daily basis.
And isn’t that what money is supposed to do?

Key Lessons from “The Automatic Millionaire”
1.      You Can Become a Millionaire No Matter How Much You Earn
2.      Making It Automatic in Less Than an Hour
3.      A Pro Tip: Buy a House and Pay Your Mortgage in a Biweekly Installments
You Can Become a Millionaire No Matter How Much You Earn with the Latte Factor
“In order to become an Automatic Millionaire,” writes David Bach at the beginning of his book, “you’ve got to accept the idea that regardless of the size of your paycheck, you probably already make enough money to become rich.”
In other words, it really doesn’t matter how much you earn; what matters is how much – and how smart – you save.
It’s simple math, really: if, instead of buying yourself a latte and a doughnut every day, you save and invest those $5, with an average of 10% annual return, you’ll be worth about $1,5 dollars in 40 years’ time.
Meaning, if you start this plan when you’re 20, you’ll retire as a millionaire at 60.
Making It Automatic in Less Than an Hour
The key, however, is to 
 money automatically: if it comes to discipline and willpower, you’ll probably fail. 
It’s as simple as that.
Just follow these seven steps, and you’re 
 to become a millionaire by your retirement age:
#1. Pay yourself first automatically;
#2. Deposit your paycheck automatically;
#3. Fund your “rainy day” emergency account automatically;
#4. Fund your dream account automatically;
#5. Pay your credit card bills automatically;
#6. Pay all your monthly bills automatically;
#7. Give to charity automatically.
A Pro Tip: Buy a House and Pay Your Mortgage in a Biweekly Installments
Poor people pay rents; rich people own houses.
The worst part: over time, poor people end up paying for rents just enough money to buy themselves a house.
In other words: choose the house you like right away, and buy it!
Get a 30-year mortgage rate and start paying it off in biweekly instalments.
Meaning, instead of making one monthly payment, make a half-payment every two weeks.
That way, you’ll end up paying out the mortgage a few years earlier (there are 52 weeks a year, so you’ll make 26 half-payments or one monthly payment more with a biweekly payment plan) and you’ll save a lot of money on interest rates!

Final Notes
As he makes clear at the very beginning of the book, David Bach is pretty aware that most of the advices in 
are not new; however, he’s more than certain that the main one is: make it automatic.
At least theoretically, that should make all the difference: automatically paying yourself first means you don’t have to worry about willpower and self-discipline to save money, making sure that you’ll save them.And that advice alone makes this book more than worthy addition to
 floating around ever since people invented money.

The Whistler PDF Summary,https://blog.12min.com/the-whistler-pdf-summary/,https://blog.12min.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/image2-2.jpg,"9 min read ⌚ 
It’s mysterious, it’s elaborate, it’s electrifying.
It’s John Grisham’s 2016 novel:
Who Should Read “The Whistler”? And Why?
Oh, come on – it’s John Grisham, USA’s best thriller writer according to Ken Follett!
And who doesn’t love a good thriller from time to time?
John Grisham Biography
 is an American attorney and politician, one of the world’s most widely read novelists, and a man practically synonymous with “legal thriller” genre.
He practiced criminal law for a decade before publishing his first novel, 
; his second novel, 
, made him a nationwide celebrity; both were adapted for the screen, just as ten more of his fifty or so novels written so far.
He has also written a non-fiction book, 
, which served as the basis for a six-part Netflix documentary.
John Grisham is one of only three authors (Tom Clancy and 
 are the other two) to sell two million copies on the first printing.

Plot
The Source and the BJC
It’s only fitting that the action of a novel titled 
should start with a mysterious man contacting the Florida Board on Judicial Conduct (the BJC).
The reason?
He claims that he knows both the identity and the crimes of the most corrupt judge in the history of the United States.
At first glance, the BJC is not particularly alarmed, because, well, there are many nutjobs in the world around us who call the police about these types of things day in day out.
Between all those conspiracy who-killed-Kennedy theories, and aliens and chupacabras feasting on domesticated animals, we guess that “the most corrupt judge in the USA” is not really that big of a story.
Even if that judge has stolen more money than “all judges, from all states, and throughout U.S. history.”
But, more importantly than this, the BJC is not what it had once been. Cuts have decimated the office, and the BJC is down to its last few investigators. 
“Seven,” writes Grisham, “in a state of twenty million people, with a thousand judges sitting in six hundred courtrooms and processing a half a million cases a year.”
No wonder that 
 – one of the main characters of our story whom we’ll meet in just a second – is “forever grateful that almost all judges were honest, hardworking people committed to justice and equality. Otherwise, she would have left long ago. The small number of bad apples kept her busy fifty hours a week.”
Meet Ramsey Mix, aka Greg Myers
The above-mentioned 
 is the investigator assigned to the case. 
She is not a cop but a lawyer, and responding to calls such as these is part of her work description. However, most of them amount to nothing, and after nine years with the Board on Judicial Conduct she has learned that most problems are not caused by corruption, but incompetence.
Together with her partner 
, Lacy heads to St. Augustine to meet the source in person – and find out everything he knows (or doesn’t know) about USA’s most corrupt judge.
Now, this person turns out to be a guy named 
, a lawyer by trade, who’s living on a boat called 
,
whose address is the address of his brother and who has a single client whose name he doesn’t know.
Already shady?
Wait till you hear this: Ramsey is also an ex-con, having spent sixteen months in a federal camp after pleading to one count of mail fraud back in the days when he had practiced law with a license.
And there’s more:
His name is actually 
at the moment, the name he intends to use to file a complaint without which the BJC cannot proceed with the case.
No wonder Lacy suddenly starts doubting “the wisdom of traveling to St. Augustine to meet this guy. A state employee too frightened to come forward. A reformed lawyer so spooked that he went to court in another state and changed his name. An ex-con with no real address.”
Another problem?
Mix is not really interested in answering the usual questions an investigator might ask his or her source.
And yet – he claims he has a story like no other.
Greg Myers’ Story
“This is a long story that will take some time to unfold,” says Ramsey Mix during the first of the few meetings he has with Lacy and Hugo. “It involves a ton of money, corruption that is astonishing, and some really nasty guys who wouldn’t think twice about putting a bullet or two between my eyes, yours, my client’s, anyone who asks too many questions.”
And throughout the following few chapters, we learn that the most corrupt judge in USA’s history is a woman named 
 presiding over Florida’s 24
 Circuit and living in Brunswick County, a fictional place located somewhere between Pensacola and Tallahassee, in the unofficial Florida Panhandle.
And then Greg proceeds to tell Lacy and Hugo quite a few things about the Honorable Claudia McDover.
First, he shares quite a few personal details:
Now Claudia wasn’t carved for small-town practice, so, very soon, she got bored with her job; and then she met a guy named 
, “a bad dude but a very smart man.”
Don’t worry, you’ll meet him in an instant as well.
Now, after meeting Vonn Dubose, Claudia McDover suddenly developed an interest in politics and ran for circuit court judge.
Coincidentally, this happened in 1993, very soon after the Tappacola Nation – “a small tribe of about four hundred scattered along the Panhandle” – voted against the opening of a casino in the serenity of their Reservation.
The man who approached them with the idea: the afore-mentioned 
.
The man who eventually emerged victorious: “an agitator named 
,” a Christian who opposes gambling on moral grounds.
Now, back to Claudia: after a well-funded and well-organized campaign, McDover beats the incumbent by a thousand votes and wins the position of a circuit court judge.
Just a month after she takes office, Son Razko is murdered, his body found in another man’s bedroom, along with this other man’s wife, both shot twice in the head.
Of course, the main suspect is the husband, a man named 
, coincidentally a close ally of Razko during their anti-gambling campaign.
Judge McDover presides over his trial and, of course, Mace is convicted for the double murder, despite steadfastly claiming his innocence.
You can already guess where this story is going.
The mastermind behind everything is Vonn Dubose, the leader of the so-called Coast Mafia and a descendant of one of the original gangsters of the county who had begun their mischief in “the rear room of a catfish restaurant near Forrest City, Arkansas.”
His story:
Now, having planned everything in advance, Vonn Dubose spent the few years between the first anti-gambling vote and the murder of Razko buying property off all the investors and speculators who had jumped in when it looked like the Tappacola wanted a casino.
“He knew what was coming and soon had the Indian land surrounded,” says Mix. “With Son Razko out of the way, and removed in such a dramatic fashion, the proponents won the second election. The rest is history.”
So, in a nutshell, everything was clear now for more than two decades of utmost corruption, starting with the construction of “Treasure Key,”
The rest is as simple as a Martin Scorsese’s movie gets: Vonn Dubose took care of everyone he didn’t like (“he whittled his gang down to just a handful of cousins so there would be fewer hands in the till”) and Judge McDover made sure that there are no legal obstacles between Dubose and the realization of his master plan.
Even better, Van Dubose “operated with complete anonymity and hid behind a wall of offshore companies, all of which were overseen by a certain law firm in Biloxi.”
Things Escalate
Quite expectedly – as Lacy and Hugo would learn the hard way – a guy with such power and wealth is not to be brought down easily.
After hearing things here and there about an ongoing investigation in his dealings, Vonn Dubose lures investigators Stoltz and Hatch to a rural part of the Tappacola Reservation.
The bait?
A member of the Tappacola nation who claims that he has important information which might interest Lacy and Hugo.
However, there’s no such thing: it’s all a ruse which ends with a truck deliberately striking the car of Stoltz and Hatch, killing the latter and severely injuring the former.
Ironically, Dubose’s tactic to neutralize the BJC ends up as the catalyst for his own neutralization.
Now, the director of the BJC, 
, is convinced that there are even higher stakes involved than he had previously imagined and calls in the aid of the Federal Bureau.
With their help, the BJC discovers the identity of Hugo’s henchmen and offers them a deal in exchange for some information and testimonies in relation to the relationship between Vonn Dubose, the Coast Mafia, and the Not-So-Honorable Judge McDover.
They, of course, agree.
The Whistler Epilogue
Before too long, Vonn Dubose and Judge McDover realize that someone very close to at least one of them must be leaking information about their whole operation.
The main suspect?
, Judge McDover’s recorder of seven years, the actual name of Mix’s client and the real whistler of the title.
Realizing the danger she’s in, Hooper flees her job and settles in a cheap hotel; however, she’s tracked by the Coast Mafia and, soon enough, she has a hitman on her heels.
Now recovered, Lacy Stoltz helps Hooper to escape the hitman and takes her to the airport in Valdosta where Lacy’s brother, Gunther Stoltz – a real estate developer from Atlanta – flies the two women to western North Carolina.
There, the two hide in a lakeside cabin in the mountains, waiting for the FBI to finish what the two had started.
And the FBI does: the Dubose syndicate is dismantled, the main culprits are arrested, and Judge McDover is sentenced to a quarter of a century in prison.
“Frail and much thinner after seventeen months of jailhouse food,” in all her stoicism, McDover is merely a shadow of her former self.
In the front row, Lacy, with Special Agent 
 on one side and JoHelen on the other, “almost felt sorry for her.”

: 
Who Should Read “Real Artists Don’t Starve”? And Why?
 is, of course, a book best suited for aspiring artists and other creative minds. 
It is especially good for those who want to create but see no dough in the profession and those who do create but think that they shouldn’t earn money from something so noble.
Jeff Goins begs to differ, and he makes a great case.
Real Artists Don’t Starve Summary
Introduction: Myth of the Starving Artist
“The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short, but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.”
These words were said, over half a millennium ago, by Michelangelo Buonarroti, a man called “The Divine One” already in his lifetime, and a man consensually considered one of the greatest artists in the history of humankind – if not the very greatest.
Now, Michelangelo was even more than that which is why, together with his contemporary 
, he is considered the archetypal Renaissance Man as well.
For example – although it is not that well known – Michelangelo was also one of the greatest poets of his time, and, to many, his delicate and profound sonnets rank up there with Shakespeare’s as some of the highest poetic achievements in history.
In one of them, Michelangelo says that his art had left him “poor, old and working as a servant of others.”
Nothing surprising, right?
After all, there aren’t many artists who you’ve thought of having achieved something more in material terms, which is why Carl Spitzweg’s painting “The Poor Poet” looks to many as just about the perfect depiction of a writer’s daily struggles.
Shockingly – as Virginia Woolf reminded us in 
it is not so: many artists throughout history were actually pretty rich.
And Michelangelo (the guy who described himself as a poor servant) – as Rab Hatfield discovered in 2002 – was 
, boasting a fortune more than $30 million in today’s money.
Jeff Goins’ point?
The story of the starving, struggling artist is a myth – mostly written by rich artists. 
The truth is that real artists don’t strive; they thrive.
Already in the “Introduction” to his book,
Jeff Goins makes known that there’s a New Renaissance happening around us and that it has already given birth to the Thriving Artist.
Want to become one?
It’s easy!
Just dispel the old myths – and start adhering to the new ones.
Here they are, the principles every Thriving Artist lives by – the Rules of the New Renaissance:
#1. The Starving Artist believes you must be born an artist. The Thriving Artist knows you must become one.
#2. The Starving Artist strives to be original. The Thriving Artist steals from his influences.
#3. The Starving Artist believes he has enough talent. The Thriving Artist apprentices under a master.
#4. The Starving Artist is stubborn about everything. The Thriving Artist is stubborn about the right things.
#5. The Starving Artist waits to be noticed. The Thriving Artist cultivates patrons.
#6. The Starving Artist believes he can be creative anywhere. The Thriving Artist goes where creative work is already happening.
#7. The Starving Artist always works alone. The Thriving Artist collaborates with others.
#8. The Starving Artist does his work in private. The Thriving Artist practices in public.
#9. The Starving Artist works for free. The Thriving Artist always works for something.
#10. The Starving Artist sells out too soon. The Thriving Artist owns his work.
#11. The Starving Artist masters one craft. The Thriving Artist masters many.
#12. The Starving Artist despises the need for money. The Thriving Artist makes money to make art.
Let’s look at them one by one!
Part 1: Mind-Set
“We first approach our art not with our hands but with our minds,” writes Goins in the short introduction to the first part of 
.
And he goes on to explain some more:
We all develop thought patterns and limiting beliefs that prohibit us from being where we want to be in life, and creative work is no exception. Here, we attack those obstacles head-on, adopting new ways of thinking, so that we can stop starving and start creating. We must master our mind-set.”
“Artists are born, not made.”
This adage is as old as (at least) the Roman Empire.
The only problem?
It is not true.
In reality, everyone can become an artist: writing, painting, music – they are all skills (like many others) that can be acquired.
Take 
, for example.
As you know full well, he is a lawyer by trade and a writer by choice; interestingly enough, it was the latter that made him a household name and a millionaire.
Grisham started his career by spending just an hour daily to write about one page of his first book. Three years later, that book became his first novel (
), so unattractive that 40 publishers passed on it before it finally reached the shelves in a modest print run of 5,000 copies.
Grisham didn’t give up and wrote another novel.
Perhaps you’ve heard of it: 
.
Suddenly, Grisham became the talk of the town and, after 
became a successful Hollywood movie starring Tom Cruise soon after, the sky became the limit.
The interesting paradox?
A man who wasn’t a writer by profession invented the most popular genre of the modern age: the legal thriller.
Perhaps it has to do something with Grisham’s ability 
?
Can you?
That’s your road to greatness.
(And, let’s not forget, wealth.)
“Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal” – wrote T. S. Eliot in 1920.
And more than two decades before him, another guy, W. H. Davenport Adams, praised Alfred Tennyson for his “assimilative method, when he adopts an image or a suggestion from a predecessor, and works it up into his own glittering fabric.”
He recapped the technique in “a modest canon:” “great poets imitate and improve, whereas small ones steal and spoil.”
You might have heard this adage in another version (
) – “Good artists copy. Great artists steal” – but what matters most is its essence.
And that is: originality doesn’t exist; the most original artists merely improve upon older visions and designs.
“To be ignorant of what occurred before you were born,” wrote Cicero once, “is to remain always a child.”
So, don’t be one!
Learn everything there is to know and 
it.
Postmodernism is nothing more but a critically approved theft.
Before Michelangelo became Michelangelo, he was nothing more but a humble student of a famous Florentine artist now mainly known as his teacher, a certain Domenico Ghirlandaio.
Interestingly enough, that’s how most great art careers begin: with an apprenticeship.
“Before we become masters,” writes Goins, “we must first become apprentices.”
And even later on, it doesn’t hurt to ask for a piece of advice or two (see advices 6 and 7).
As Atul Gawande says: 
However, most artists aren’t humble.
In fact, they are quite the opposite of that: stubborn and resilient in their vision of the world.
That’s the other part of your mind that you need cultivating if you want to become a master: when the time is right, end your apprenticeship and try to sever the links to the old order.
And, more importantly, persist in your vision.
If Grisham’s first novel was rejected by 40 publishers, Fitzgerald’s 
was by no less than 122! And 
?
You know why Grisham, Fitzgerald and Rowling succeeded?
Because they were (as Jeff Bezos) says “stubborn on vision,” and “flexible on details.”
Starving artists are flexible on the details as well.
Thriving ones know better.
Part 2: Market
Once you master your mindset, it’s time to tackle the market, “the place where we become professionals and learn how this works in the real world.”
If we do it well, says Jeff Goins, people will not just pay attention, but they will also pay you.
If you’ve ever read the original Charles Perrault’s version of Cinderella, then you already know that in addition to the shallow Disney message that inner beauty and graciousness beats physical good looks, there’s also another more, interesting one:
“Without doubt, it is a great advantage to have intelligence, courage, good breeding, and common sense. These, and similar talents come only from heaven, and it is good to have them. However, even these may fail to bring you success, without the blessing of a godfather or a godmother.”
Ha? You didn’t expect that, did you?
Like it or not, that’s how the real world works!
We all like and love figures such as, say, Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash but there’s no way we would have known them if it wasn’t for a guy named Sam Phillips, an American record producer.
If it wasn’t for him, quipped once Cash, “I might still be working in a cotton field.”
Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis – they would probably say something similar.
The lesson?
Don’t wait to be noticed. Cultivate patrons who can nurture your noticeability.
We’ve already told you more than once that a thorn between roses smells lovely, but a rose between thorns withers away.
Well, that’s the essence of Jeff Goins’ next lesson: you cannot be creative anywhere, but only where creative work is already happening.
The first asks for tremendous amounts of discipline and willpower; the latter turns them into an everyday ritual.
As we have already told you in our summary of 
, genius is not born in isolation and, moreover, genius breeds genius.
Why?
Because, wherever there’s a cluster of creative individuals, there’s also an abundance of profound and meaningful discussion.  
Whether it’s Ancient Athens we’re talking about or pre-war Vienna, whether it’s between-the-wars Paris or the Silicon Valley in question, what spurs the creative mind on is always the scene.
 “The most important factor in the success of your career,” Jeff Goins was told by Richard Florida, a college professor, “is where you decide to live.”
Berlin, maybe?
Let us guess:
You’re the new Shakespeare, the new Michelangelo, the great, lone genius whose vision can’t be understood by anyone on this planet?
And all those Beyoncés of the world are mere beautiful faces who are considered musical geniuses even though they have more than 15 writers on 
song only?
Right?
Well, wrong, very wrong.
Most of the great artists in history collaborated with one or two other artists at least once in their lives; and many others have done it much more and with many more people.
Both Shakespeare and Michelangelo are often considered incomparable in their skill and intellectual capacities to their contemporaries, but, for some reason, these two guys didn’t share the opinion.
On the contrary: both collaborated with their friends when their projects demanded that.
“We don’t do our best work alone,” writes Goins. And that is because “creativity is not a solitary invention but a collaborative creation.”
Myth #8: geniuses create in solitude and share their work with the world only after they’re finished.
Fact #8: great creative minds throughout history have practiced in public and perfected their work through sharing and feedbacks.
In fact, not 
 your work is one of the worst things you can do (both for yourself and the ones that come after you), and, according to none other by Edgar Allan Poe himself, we owe the myth of the enlightened artist to a little something called “authorial vanity.”
“I have often thought how interesting a magazine paper might be written by any author who would – that is to say, who could – detail, step by step, the processes by which any one of his compositions attained its ultimate point of completion,” 
 wrote in his “Philosophy of Composition.” 
And now we have a way to do that.
It’s called blogging and it’s not just a peek into the creative process.
It is the Creative Process itself.
Part 3: Money
“If we are going to thrive as artists,” writes Jeff Goins, “we cannot merely survive. We have to make a living off our creations, which means at some point we need to talk about the part we’re all uncomfortable discussing: money.”
Of course, the Starving Artist avoids this topic as a Christian avoids the Devil, but the Thriving Artist knows that business is part of art and even money is something an artist must master.
Here’s how.
Unfortunately, many artists consider the pleasure they get from creating something enough – it isn’t work if you don’t break at least a drop of sweat, is it?
Or is that so?
“When bankers get together for dinner, they discuss Art,” wrote once Oscar Wilde ironically. “When artists get together for dinner, they discuss Money.”
Only, just like the creative process, this is kept hidden from the public.
It is a fact of life that you need money, because, well, everybody needs money. And it is an even surer fact of life that if you work for free, you won’t get any money.
So, stop doing that.
Start valuing your work the way Michelangelo did.
The money will come itself.
This is very important.
We live in a capitalist world and everyone wants to make the maximum profit possible with minimum effort.
In other words, nobody is really interested in giving you money just like that.
This is why there are such things as an internship (aka free work) and also the reason why there are such things as “lifetime rights” or “ghostwriters.”
Stay away from these.
Own your work – you never know how much money it could bring you in the future.
Just imagine how much money would Jim Hanson had lost if he had agreed to sell the rights to his Rowlf the Dog puppet when he was offered $10,000 for them by the Purina dog company!
Hanson, fortunately, didn’t agree to such a deal and went on to create the Muppets, which, of course, brought him many times that amount.
“Jack of all trades, master of none” – an old saying which describes our current attitude towards 
.
In plain words: if you dabble in more crafts than one, then you’re probably bad at all of them.
However, as 
 and 
 noted a long time ago, this couldn’t be further from the truth and is a product of the system we’re living in – not the nature of a human being.
After all, how did Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo Galilei and 
 managed to excel at so many things?
“A man can do all things if he will,” wrote Leon Battista Alberti in the 15
 century.
He was right.
It’s a new age, and you need to master more crafts than one if you want to have more chances to succeed. 
Also: your mind likes adventures.
So you’ll be happier as well.
We mentioned Marx above – time to quote him now:
“The writer must earn money in order to be able to live and to write, but he must by no means live and write for the purpose of making money.”
What does that mean if slipped out of its wording and syntax?
Simply put:
You must make money to make art; nothing more, and nothing less.
: “Money exists, in my world, to buy me another season.”
“Every season you create instead of scramble to find work is a win,” adds Jeff Goins, “and with time, those seasons add up. The more money you have, the more time you have; and the more time you have, the more art you can make.”
It’s that simple.
Conclusion: Join the New Renaissance
If you were an artist in the Renaissance, concludes Goins, you’d probably laugh away the idea of the starving artist specialized in one genre.
You’d almost certainly believe in the opposite: that you are both capable of and expected to master few crafts, that you have to do that under an old master for the first part of your life, and that there’s nothing wrong in collaborating, practicing in public or earning money for your work. 
Well, Goins notes, after the period of wide-eyed Romanticism, there is a new renaissance that is turning starving artists into thriving artists and it is your job to embrace it.
Because now you have a choice:
“You can go the way of the tired, frustrated artist who struggles to keep creating. Or you can embrace an important but challenging truth that just might set you free from such thinking. You don’t have to starve. You can thrive. The world is waiting for you to create your best work. Please don’t let us down.”
Key Lessons from “Real Artists Don’t Starve”
1.      Artists Are Not Born – They Are Made
2.      If You Are an Artist, Then the Market Is Your Friend
3.      Make Money to Make Art – Not the Other Way Around
Artists Are Not Born – They Are Made
Even though many would beg to differ, there are numerous cases of people who became artists the way one becomes pretty much everything else: through years of study.
In fact, the very word “art” means “skill,” and in Ancient Greece, poetry, for example, belonged to the same category of creative endeavors as, say, carpentry.
And if you want to learn to become an artist, learn it the way most artists have: under an old master.
If You Are an Artist, Then the Market Is Your Friend
Even though it is usually believed that only minor and sold-out artists can be successful, historically, it has often been the other way around: Michelangelo, for example, boasted a fortune which equals to at least $30 million in current money (some say even twice that).
And it’s not only that: being out on the market is beneficial to the creative process itself. Cultivating patrons, joining a vibrant, creative scene, collaborating with others and practicing in public – these are all great strategies on how to both become a better artist and start earning money from your art.
Make Money to Make Art – Not the Other Way Around
Now, don’t get Jeff Goins wrong: he doesn’t say that you should start creating the things the public wants and earn some easy money on the side.
No – he still thinks that art is a noble profession. However, he adds that money doesn’t spoil it; in fact, it makes it possible.
It is pointless to make art in order to make money (that is probably not art, anyway); however, it makes a lot of sense to make money so as to make 
art.
Otherwise, how would you?

Feeling a bit unhappy today?
Richard Carlson says that you shouldn’t be.
Because:
.
Who Should Read “You Can Be Happy No Matter What”? And Why?
There are already 
, and, in a way, 
offers very few new or different insights.
However, it is certainly a book you’d like to check out if you want to attain happiness: Carlson was both a psychotherapist and a pretty popular motivational speaker, so you’ve got nothing to lose.
Especially since this is one of his top 3 books.
About Richard Carlson
 was an American psychotherapist, bestselling author, and motivational speaker.
He became a nationwide celebrity about a decade after debuting with his first book: 
 topped both the 
’s and 
 bestseller lists for about hundred weeks and ended up being translated into about 30 languages.
Prolific author, Carlson wrote twenty books before passing suddenly while on tour, in the 46
 year of his life.

“You Can Be Happy No Matter What PDF Summary”
“In this extraordinary book,” writes Dr. Wayne Dyer in the “Preface” to 
,
Dr. Carlson explains that life is not your enemy, but your thinking can be.”
To those already familiar with Ricard Carlson’s work, this is nothing new: at the very basis of his philosophy – or, better yet, psychology – of happiness is the 
 that “there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.” 
Put simply, we are thinking creatures – that’s why biologists refer to our species as 
 – but, unfortunately, we don’t always think the way we 
 be; had we the power to do that, then we would have been much happier.
Because – and this is one of the main ideas of 
 – happiness is not something we should 
, but something we need to learn how to 
; happiness is, to quote Dyer once again, “not the end of the road; it’s the beginning.” 
Expectedly, Carlson’s objective with this book is to teach us how never to let our happiness slip away from us; in order to do that, he extracts five principles which should “act as navigational tools to help you find contentment in your life.” 
He explains them in detail in the first part of the book; since this is the far more important segment, we’ll dedicate our attention in the summary below almost exclusively to this part.
In the second five-chapter part (appropriately titled “Applying the Principles”), Carlson gives a few examples on how to employ the knowledge from the first part in real-life situations; the subjects covered here are relationships, stress, solving problems, happiness, and health and addictions.
The book ends with a chapter titled “A Checklist for Your Life.”
Happiness Is a Natural State
If you are like most of the people, you probably believe that your life is just a series of misfortunate events interspersed with brief periods of happiness – and not the other way around.
Richard Carlson thinks otherwise.
“Our most natural state of mind,” he writes, “is one of contentment and joy. The barriers or obstructions that keep us from experiencing these positive feelings are learned negative processes that we have innocently come to accept as ‘necessary,’ or as ‘just the way life is.’”
Let us rephrase that so you can understand it better.
You are born and created to be happy, filled with inner peace, satisfaction, curiosity, affection, and feelings of gratitude for the ones you love and are loved by. If you don’t believe us, just have a look at absolutely any child playing a game, and you’ll understand what this actually means.
However, you spend a large part of your life learning and acquiring behaviors and habits which hinder your chance at happiness.
How?
Well, by simply hacking your brain into thinking that it’s in a constant struggle and should be constantly aware of it.
If you want to be happy in life, your job is simple: to remove these obstructions and, thus, uncover the inherent positive feelings you are born with, your natural state, the one Carlson refers to as “healthy psychological functioning” or simply “a nice feeling.”
The result is a more meaningful and beautiful experience of life.
The Key to Happiness: Your Mind
If permanent happiness is not something which comes from the outside (aka it is not something you’ll attain after solving some problems or, say, getting that job you want), it is only natural that the inside-out change of perspective starts and ends with your mind, the alpha and omega of your body.
And as Carlson says, your mind is a two-fold organism, which serves you in two different ways:
You can already sense the problem: computers are not only impractical but virtually useless if you want to find an answer to some of the biggest questions in life.
Why?
Because in cases such as, say, marriage or relationship problems, we usually don’t have all the variables, and computers are incapable of taking a leap of faith.
Let’s put it this way: the computer part of your brain is memory-based; the transmitter part is insight-based. Which one of the two you’d use to solve a 
 problem if you had a choice?
That’s right!
“New answers don’t come from what you already know in the computer part of your brain,” writes Carlson, “
.”
The Principles
So, to sum up, your mind can either work 
or 
you; the computer part is helpful in many cases, but it is unwise to use it in 
situations and circumstances.
However, since you have done this for years, you’ve already created an impermeable layer beneath which your inherent happiness struggles for breath in the transmitter part of your mind.
Reaching it will make your life less complicated and your problems more trivial, allowing you to be more lighthearted and easygoing.
And the best way to do this is to begin understanding your transmitter mind, the source of these deep, positive feelings.
Carlson’s five principles should help you.
The first four of these are based on a series of psychological principles originally formulated by Rick Suarez and Roger Mills in their 1987 book 
; the fifth – and we’re pretty sure you already now that one – is addition by Carlson.
These are the five principles in brief, as described by Carlson:
• 
. “Our ability to think creates our psychological experience of life, and thinking is a voluntary function.”
• 
. “Our own understanding that thinking is a voluntary function fluctuates from moment to moment and from day to day; these variances are called moods.”
• 
. “Because we all think in a unique way, each of us lives in a separate psychological reality.”
• 
. “Our feelings and emotions serve as a built-in biofeedback mechanism that lets us know how we are doing from a psychological standpoint.”
• 
. “Learning to keep our attention in the present moment, by paying attention to our feelings, allows us to live at peak efficiency and without the distraction of negative thinking. The present moment is where we find happiness and inner peace.”
Let’s go over them in-depth.
Key Lessons from “You Can Be Happy No Matter What”
1.      The Principle of Thought
2.      The Principle of Moods
3.      The Principle of Separate Realities
4.      The Principle of Feelings
5.      The Principle of the Present Moment
The Principle of Thought
According to Carlson, be it positive or negative, most of our feelings are a direct consequence of our modes of thinking.
It may seem strange to grasp such a notion, but think of it this way: the same event may affect ten different people in at least as many different ways.
Why?
Because each of them 
these events 
himself or herself in a different manner; the difference, naturally, stems from the ways our minds filter and analyze them.
Thinking is a voluntary process, meaning, as a famous German song says, 
.
, unaware of the fact that they are the ones who produce them and can, consequently, outlaw them.
But this is true for everybody.
Your thoughts are your own, but they are not what makes you; you can control them and change them at will.
Thoughts do not represent reality: it’s not like you must analyze the information “I spilled coffee over my pants” as an instigator of rage and disappointment; you can just accept it an interpret it in thousands of different ways.
In fact, this is what gives us such a variety among people: some are calm, others angry, yet a third group disinterested.
Use this power to your benefit.
The Principle of Moods
“Just as we are constantly thinking as human beings,” writes Carlson introducing the second principle, “our level of awareness that we are doing the thinking is constantly changing. This constant shifting in our awareness of ourselves as the thinker is what is known as changing ‘moods.’”
“Time cools, time clarifies,” wrote once Thomas Mann, “no mood can be maintained quite unaltered through the course of hours.”
Sometimes you’re in high spirits, other times you just want to lie in your bed, binge-watch a TV show and eat some ice-cream.
In either case, what’s changing is not your life or reality – but your mood; sometimes, just when everything seems so perfect, your mood levels drop and life suddenly seems unbearable; other times, life is hopeless, but then a mood shift brings the butterflies and the rainbows.
The point?
If neither mood is eternal, then it’s only reasonable to make decisions and find solutions to problems when you’re in high mood:
The Principle of Separate Realities
You know what they say: no two human beings are the same.
And you know why is that?
Because everyone’s thinking mode produces a very unique frame of reference; as we said introducing the first principle, the very same event can be interpreted in numerous different ways by different people; multiple that by thousand, and you realize how different and varying worldviews can be.
The problem?
You spend a lot of energy trying to change someone else’s opinions and beliefs; and chances are, within 
 frame of reference, the things you say echo in unpredictable manners and eventually end up meaning things you won’t understand.
The solution?
Stop trying to change others. 
The better way is just to accept the fact that everyone lives in a separate 
 of reality and to open your heart and mind to other people’s visions of the world around you.
That’s what makes growth and compromise possible, and that’s what humanity is all about.
The Principle of Feelings
The epigraph to this chapter is a quote by Sheila Krystal: 
You are only one thought away from a good feeling.”
Its essence: something Epicurus and his followers firmly believed, i.e., that your feelings are good indicators of 
 you should think:
Carlson provides a good analogy to understand this: “when a warning light flashes in our car,” he writes, “the particular reason why it’s flashing is not as crucial at first as the fact that 
. The thing to do is pull off the road and turn off the motor.”
In other words, anger, jealousy, resentment, greed, depression – these are all just signs that you’ve wandered off your healthy psychological functioning.
If you don’t stop the car and see what’s wrong with it, you may run out of gas or realize that your breaks are not working at the next bend.
But then – it might be too late.
The Principle of Present Moment
Live in the moment.
“Virtually every spiritual teacher throughout history has suggested this solution,” reminds us Carlson. “In fact, this may be one of the oldest and wisest pieces of advice for living a happier life.”
The wisdom behind this advice is too simple to require an analysis: all you have is 
; everything else is just an illusion – even if it is the past.
If you allow your mind to wander off too often, you’ll entrap yourself within illusions; a mind that is not living in the moment is a mind perfectly prepared for a whirlwind of worries and regrets.
On the other hand, a mind that is living in the moment is a mind in which contentment, satisfaction, and happiness are not just possible, but a natural state of existence.

In the “Introduction” to

gives an answer to the questions above we felt we are entitled to quote in full:

“Stop Thinking, Start Living PDF Summary”
Originally published as 
in 1992, 
goes over many common-sense strategies which should help you leave doubts and anxieties aside so that you can finally start living a healthy and happy life.
Before we provide you with a chapter-by-chapter summary of the book, we feel that it’s necessary to make a few terminological distinctions regarding a few words we will probably use quite often below:
• 
: the intelligence behind all life;
• 
being aware of your existence;
• 
: the thing which helps you interpret reality;
• 
: the actual objective reality, regardless of how you interpret it. 
Chapter 1: Possibilities
According to Richard Carlson, “happiness is a moment-to-moment choice that each of us makes. In order to be happy, you must first 
 to be happy.”
It may sound strange at first, but it actually works that way.
If you don’t believe us, just think of all those sudden shifts in your consciousness when, despite the external stimuli remaining the same, you suddenly start feeling a lot better.
James Joyce called these 
, and Carlson refers to them as “changes of heart.”
Either way, they are not intrinsically related to the reality of the external world; and therein lie all the possibilities of happiness.
Chapter 2: Your Thoughts and the Way You Feel
We are all 
thinking. 
Try to grasp the reality behind this, because, most probably, you are not aware of it: even when you’re trying not to think, you are actually thinking; that’s why 
 and that’s why Carlson compares thinking to breathing.
Now, don’t get us wrong: thinking constantly is a good thing; it can be an even better one if you are aware of the fact what thinking 
 is.
You may better understand what it is if you understand what it is not; and it is certainly 
the real world around you.
In other words, no matter how convinced you are in something, that doesn’t make it true; the very fact that there’s someone else who’s convinced into something quite the opposite leaves a lot of space for reasonable doubt.
You’ve thought of thinking as a process similar to breathing in terms of its automatic nature, and now you should think of thinking as a process similar to dreaming in terms of its reality. Though both are essentially the same, for some reason, we think of dreaming as something false and of our thoughts as something necessarily right.
Why is it important to understand that what you think about something has no effect on that something?
Because that way you’ll understand that your feelings are an illusion as well; because they are actually formed by your thoughts.
If you think that the loss of your favorite football team grants the anger it produces, then you’ll be angry; if however, you think that it’s just a trivial event, life should go on as usual.
Remember: you don’t 
reality; you feel your thought interpreting reality.
Chapter 3: Healthy Psychological Functioning
According to Richard Carlson, healthy psychological functioning is our natural state – and it is a state of perfect equilibrium and absolute happiness.
Then why are we feeling so sad from time to time?
Because we’ve acquired, through our lives, a set of behaviors which have raised a wall between ourselves and our “healthy psychological functioning.”
Now, the only thing we can do to get back on track is to dig deep beneath these layers and understand the 
 of our natural state.
Just as you can’t really understand light by studying the dark, you’ll never understand happiness by examining the unhealthy psychological functioning of your brain.
The starting point?
Dismissing your thoughts.
Chapter 4: Dismissing Thoughts
If you realize halfway through a movie that it’s a bad one, you do the most reasonable thing you can: you turn it off; life is just too short to waste it on bad movies.
Well, the same should be true with your thoughts: so many of them are bad thoughts, and yet, since you firmly believe that they are 
, instead of freeing yourself from them, you let them imprison you in their negativity.
The truth is – you can dismiss any thought you like: you’ve created it, and you have the power to destroy it.
It isn’t time which heals all wounds; it is the dismissal of negative thoughts which fade away over time. 
Speed up the process, and you’ll heal faster. 
Or you may not even get hurt in the first place.
Chapter 5: Wisdom
Your mind serves you in essentially two different ways: either it is a “computer,” or a “transmitter.”
The first way of thinking is memory-based and is called processing; the latter one is insight-based and is the creative, free-flowing mode of your thinking habits.
Now, the problem is that while knowledge (the ability to solve familiar problems) exists within your processing brain, wisdom lies out of the reach of your processing mind and somewhere deep inside your free-flowing mode of thinking.
Let’s put it this way: you would never expect from a computer to solve your dating problems, would you?
Well, apparently, that’s what you do most of the time: you use memory to solve new and unique problems and get stuck within them, thus creating a new thought-related problem:
Want knowledge? Then use your biological computer.
Want wisdom? Just turn it off.
Chapter 6: Thoughts Grow with Attention
Remember 
?
Of course, you do. 
Let us remind you of Lester Burnham’s final words: 
We feel that 
 movie and 
 quote explain the title and the contents of this chapter better than anything.
And are the perfect background for Carlson’s golden rule of happiness: “it’s impossible to feel gratitude for something when you are too busy trying to improve it.”
Chapter 7: Thought Systems
The problem why there are so many misunderstandings in this world is quite simple: every single being on this planet thinks differently.
These thoughts, in time, create thought systems which you can best imagine as kind of maps of reality; however, just like two people with different maps would never agree as to which is the right direction, people with two different thought systems would never reach a compromise over something.
If you want to live a happier life, you need to accept something which is a fact: your thought map is just 
map of the world and, just like all others, it isn’t a perfect map.
Your job is to be open-minded and, thus, constantly improve it: not to go around and look for proofs that it is the correct one.
Chapter 8: Choice Points
“Life can be seen as a continuing series of ‘choice points,’” writes Richard Carlson. “The sum of our decisions regarding the direction we take with our choice points will determine, to a very large extent, the way we feel.”
Carlson defines “a choice point” is “an isolated moment in time when you have an opportunity to choose between your healthy functioning (the path of love and contentment) and the path of ‘thinking it through.’”
Here’s his chart of what this means in real-world situations:
Even though sometimes you’ll have no option but to take the Path of Thinking It Through, the key to a happy life is taking the Path of Love as often as possible.
Chapter 9: The Thinking Habit
True, habits are difficult to break, and few are more difficult than the habit of thinking negatively; but 
.
Thinking negatively is 
 the wrong choice; because your thoughts govern your feelings and because your feelings are how you experience reality, negative thinking is a surefire way to depression.
On average, over 90 percent of the thinking of Carlson’s patients is negative.
How does he know this?
Because he asks his patients – as the first step toward recovery – to start paying attention to their negative thoughts and start writing them down.
The result?
An awareness of how much they control their own happiness.
Chapter 10: Moods
“There has never been, nor will there ever be, a person who doesn’t experience the ups and downs of moods,” writes Richard Carlson. “Even the happiest person isn’t immune to them.”
Sometimes, just a simple shift in your mood is all it takes for the world to suddenly look much brighter than before; unfortunately, this holds true in the opposite case as well.
And no matter how perfect your thinking habits are, your moods are inevitable biological products of the way your body functions.
The trick to remaining happy is this: don’t think too much while in a low mood; just like in a broken mirror, everything is distorted and inaccurate then. 
A happy person isn’t a person who doesn’t have ups and downs; a happy person is a person who knows that both of these conditions are temporary.
Chapter 11: Living in the Present Moment
“Perhaps the oldest and wisest piece of advice for escaping depression and living a happier life,” writes Carlson here and elsewhere, “is to live in the present moment.”
However, even though many would agree that this is great advice, very few adhere to it.
The problem is twofold: very few people actually understand their thinking habits and even fewer the power of their own moods.
Be one of them and start appreciating the Now.
Because it is not just a metaphor 
.
Chapter 12: Life Is Like a Pendulum
“An excellent way to understand where unhappiness exists in your mind and, more important, how to overcome it,” writes Richard Carlson, “is to study the following chart.”
The key to happiness isn’t blindly following the left side above; it is discrediting the right side (your analytical mind) when it is not producing happiness.
How would you know when to do this?
It’s simple: just follow your feelings.
Chapter 13: Mental Health and the Dynamics of Unhappiness
You know how a couple starts acting differently the moment it accepts the fact that it is a couple?
Well, the same happens to you when you label yourself an unhappy person. 
Suddenly, a trivial event such as the loss of a clock is followed by questions such as “Why me?” and, even worse, potential joyful events are joined by doubt and anxiety which, in turn, oil the mechanism of the dreaded self-fulfilling prophecy of failure.
The only way to counter this is to rip the “unhappy” label as a band-aid and start seeing yourself as you do the people around you.
News flash: you are almost certainly not that different from them.
Chapter 14: Grief and Loss
Sometimes, some events are objectively negative; it is inevitable that, at some point in your life, you’ll have to deal with a broken relationship and, at another, even with the loss of a loved one.
We don’t need to tell you that grief is normal in these circumstances; however, we do feel the need to point out that it is not normal to become imprisoned 
 the thoughts of grief.
Shut down your biological computer and experience the wisdom of the free-flowing thinking mode; your transmitter-brain will always show you the way to the 
.
Chapter 15: Illness and Death
In a way, this chapter is a continuation of the previous one.
You can’t feel well if you are physically sick, and you certainly cannot feel joy if you need to accept the death of a loved one.
However, utilizing the power of your natural state – the state of healthy psychological functioning – is still the best thing you got.
It both clears and opens your mind to new possibilities.
And that, in some situations, is enough in itself.
Chapter 16: Many Problems, One Solution
Carlson describes it thus:
In the words of Einstein, “The solution to a problem will never come about from the same level of understanding that created the problem in the first place.”
And put plainly: “if you can’t solve a problem in a positive state of mind, you will never be able to solve that problem in a lower state of mind.”
Chapter 17: Unhappiness Is Your Curriculum
Remember the opening sentence of 
: “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”
Carlson rephrases Tolstoy thus: “Every person has a curriculum, and every curriculum can be overcome and conquered.” Obviously, unlike Tolstoy, Carlson is a bit more optimistic.
And he thinks he has a reason for this!
After all, he says, no matter what kind of problems you go through, the Holocaust survivors certainly went through much bigger and more unbearable ones.
And yet – many of them overcame and conquered them.
What’s your excuse?
Chapter 18: The Art of Optimism
; this is, of course, no accident: “negative thinking gets us nowhere,” writes Carlson, “except perhaps a one-way ticket to the emotional doldrums!”
Optimism is not something you’re born with – 
. And it’s not even difficult to do that!
You just need to recognize the fact that you are 
 your thoughts and that you are force-feeding your feelings with negativity willingly. 
Next, you need to understand that you are just one thought away from a good feeling.
Finally, you can start thinking positively and, gradually, start changing your feelings as well.
Chapter 19: Happiness and Gratitude
, Richard Carlson too thinks that gratitude is attitude – and one which is so powerful that it works as the best “antidote for depression.”
Just like Lester Burnham (see Chapter 6 above), you need to start feeling gratitude for every single moment of your stupid, little life.
Because it’s not stupid.
And because is literally 
you have.
Key Lessons from “Stop Thinking, Start Living”
1.      There Is a Difference Between the Reality and Your Thoughts and Feelings
2.      Your Natural State Is the State of Happiness
3.      Use Your Analytical Brain Less to Be Happier
There Is a Difference Between the Reality and Your Thoughts and Feelings
Even though it may seem strange to you, your thoughts and your feelings are not indicators of the real, objective reality, aka the world as it is; they are just an interpretation of it and nothing more.
This is the reason why there are so many misunderstandings and problems in the world: everyone believes that his thoughts and feelings are the only possible interpretation when numerous are true; even though they are mutually exclusive.
Your Natural State Is the State of Happiness
You are born to be happy: your natural state is the state of healthy psychological functioning.
However, throughout life, you spend a lot of time struggling against this notion and believing that, in fact, the opposite is true.
If you want to live a happy life, you need to realize that happiness is not something you must attain, but something you only need to retain.
Use Your Analytical Brain Less to Be Happier
Speaking of which: a great way of retaining happiness is letting go of things. 
Namely, if your natural state is the state of healthy psychological functioning, then everything else is waste. 
To get rid of it, from time to time, feel free to press the off button of your analytical brain; apparently, too much thinking is bad for both your happiness 
your health.

Want to be successful?
Then you better learn how to play the great game.
And the main lesson according to Wes Berry:
.
Who Should Read “Big Things Have Small Beginnings”? And Why?
is a book about everyone ambitious enough to dream of a successful company. 
It is a book which lays down the essentials of business in a pretty bare, straightforward form – so it’s best suited for a novice or a future entrepreneur.
Experienced leaders may consult it as a reminder.
About Wes Berry
 is an American entrepreneur, business expert, and bestselling author.
After turning his family’s 60k florist shop into a $60-million floral, gifts, and plants international business, Berry sold the company to follow other passions and enjoy other endeavors.
One of this is 
, a weekly radio podcast of which Berry is the host; the other is sharing his knowledge through the written word, and 
was the first step in that direction; the book was a 
 and 
 bestseller.

“Big Things Have Small Beginnings PDF Summary”
Introduction
“I chose the title 
 for this book,” writes Wes Berry in the very first sentence of it, “because I know that I’m living proof of that very truth.”
Even more, he goes on: “every successful leader I’ve studied has in some way or another borne out the same truth.”
And the truth is rather simple and straightforward: successful people spend a lot more time and energy on small things that unsuccessful people so often seem to neglect.
To illustrate this point, Wes Berry retells a pretty little story you probably already know; but since the moral of that story is “pretty much what this book is about,” we believe it especially worthy of quoting:
If it’s not already obvious, here’s what Wes Berry would like you to remember: “when you take care of the little stuff, the big stuff has a real nice way of taking care of itself.”
Part I: Examining the Playing Field
Part I – “Examining the Playing Field” – is the shortest one of the book but it is also the most necessary if not the most important: it sets the tone for what comes next.
Comprised of only three chapters – “Ambition… For Better, or Worse?” “The American Business Climate,” and “Your ‘Why’ Is a Must-Know” – the first part begins with a quote by none other than 
:
“The person who starts out simply with the idea of getting rich,” noted once the richest man in all of human history, “
 succeed; you must have a larger ambition. There is no mystery in business success. If you do each day’s task successfully, and stay faithfully within these natural operations of commercial laws which I talk so much about, and keep your head clear, you will come out all right.”
Rockefeller’s quote is a more than appropriate for this occasion, and Wes Berry uses it as a springboard to (somewhat unnecessarily) tread a territory already haunted by none other than the messiah of the millennials, 
.
If, in combination with that Rockefeller quote, the title of the third chapter of Part I isn’t already a giveaway, let us spell it out for you: you don’t become rich by building a business to become rich; you become rich by building a business that gets you out of bed in the morning (i.e., 
).
We know they say that when the going gets tough, the tough get going, but Berry has another idea. In his opinion, when the going gets tough, the ones who have a “why” are the only ones who endure:
Don’t believe him?
Believe Viktor Frankl instead: the famous psychotherapist and Auschwitz survivor notes in 
 that the ones who survived the Holocaust were not the toughest or smartest, but the ones who had an objective, a goal, a why.
It’s that simple.
And what about Berry’s why?
: a picture of his wife and his four sons on his desk.
This picture.
To make things a bit clearer, Berry reminds us of an almost half a millennium old essay by William Shakespeare – ups, pardon us, Stratfordians – by Francis Bacon, titled simply “
.”
Its gist?
Ambitious people become dangerous if they get their ambitions 
, and not (as common sense often suggests) the other way around; if they are left to roam free – they become productive and useful.
So, if you consider yourself ambitious, then just let your self go. However, don’t forget to use your “why” as an orientation, because that’s what ambition is, after all.
“Your very desire to succeed 
 your ambition,” writes Berry. “Embrace it! Without ambition, your chances of success in business are pretty slim.”
And then he marries this personal “why” of ambition with a more universal “why”: “truly ambitious people would rather taste defeat than never have the chance to wear the laurel wreaths of victory. And the best ambitions are not just for oneself, but for an ideal, something greater than the individual.”
Even though Berry dedicates a whole chapter to explaining this idea, may it be merely a side note in our summary, because it’s not something that needs a lengthy explanation.
Namely, if you are living in 21
 century USA, consider yourself one of the luckiest people in history: it 
, and this truly is 
.
 And if you are not using the opportunities the Land of the Free gives you, then you’re really looking for an excuse 
 to
do what is necessary.
“The real freedom that American Exceptionalism champions,” concludes Berry, “is 
. Yes, it does take work. But if one is willing to do that work, then that mobility, that position, is waiting for you; it’s pulling for you to reach it.”
Part II: The Challenge of Leadership
If the first part of 
is all about the theoretical framework of becoming 
 by finding your “why,” the second part (interspersed with many examples taken straight out of Berry’s life: chapter 6 is almost exclusively biographical) is all about becoming 
 by putting the “who” between the “how” and the “what.”
Consequently – as you might have already deduced (we left you quite a few traces) – if the first part was haunted by the shadow of Simon Sinek, the second part of Berry’s book is an almost explicit homage to Jim Collins.
Unsurprisingly, the epigraph is that memorable metaphor from 
in which Collins compares a business leader to a bus driver and a business to a bus.
Here’s it in full:
The main idea of this “who” in terms of your company is summarized at the very end of Part II, when Berry writes: “If you want to build a successful company, you’ve got to build successful leaders at every level of that company.”
In other words, as someone said once, “a great teacher has always been measured by the number of his students who have surpassed him.”
Why should leaders be any different?
However, in order to 
, you need first to become a successful leader yourself. And to do this, you need to follow a few simple steps – but quite thoroughly and really 
 to them:
. Meaning: know your destination beforehand and divide your journey into many milestones; put target dates and predict bumps on the road; and never forget: no destination is too far if you know where you’re going and how to get there.
. OK, this one’s pretty self-explanatory. And we have summarized quite a few 
 to help you organize yourself.
. Always be in step with innovation; analyze other leaders and emulate them; read, read, read.
. It’s all about gaining perspective – and having an open mind to gain one.
Part III: Seeking Out That Needle in the Haystack
“You may not know of Elbert Hubbard,” writes Berry in Chapter 12 (second of Part III), “but I could not have written this book if he had not existed.”
Oh, but 
, Wes, and we 
; which, in other words, means that we already know many of the things you say in Part III – but thanks for reminding us, because every generation should remind the next one of Andrew S. Rowan.
In case you don’t remember him, check out the summary linked above; here, a three-sentence summary, just so that we can put this summary to bed.
tells the partly fictional story of the quite real American army officer Andrew Summers Rowan, who, just prior to the Spanish–American War, was tasked with carrying a message from President William McKinley to the Cuban insurgents’ leader, General Calixto García.
It was a daring escapade, but Rowan just said “Yes, sir” and, after a self-driven effort through the mountain vastness of Cuba, he eventually 
deliver the message to Garcia.
The point?
Well, let us allow Hubbard to tell it: 
“The point I wish to make,” he writes, “is this: McKinley gave Rowan a letter to be delivered to Garcia; Rowan took the letter and did not ask, ‘Where is he at?’ By the Eternal! there is a man whose form should be cast in deathless bronze and the statue placed in every college of the land.”
And he goes on” “It is not book-learning young men need, nor instruction about this and that, but a stiffening of the vertebrae which will cause them to be loyal to a trust, to act promptly, concentrate their energies: do the thing – ‘Carry a message to Garcia!’”
In other not-so-kind words (once again by Hubbard), Rowan is an antidote to “the imbecility of the average man – the inability or unwillingness to concentrate on a thing and do it.”
Wes Berry takes it from here and says: find a few Rowans, manage them well and keep each one of them long enough under your wings, and you’ve built yourself a successful business?
But how will you find a Rowan?
Berry suggests that you look for these four traits:
• focus
• perseverance
• research-oriented mind
• submissiveness to orders
Now, after you’ve found a Rowan, it’s your job to mentor him well so that he doesn’t burn out in his drive; this you’ll achieve by finding a balance between the freedom you’ll allow him and the orders you know he’ll respect.
It’s, once again, pretty simple on paper, but a bit difficult in practice.
The good thing?
It’s not that difficult when you’ve surrounded yourself with Rowans.
Conclusion
The “Conclusion” of 
is basically a highly personal commentary on the margins of “For Want of a Nail” and Rudyard Kipling’s “If.”
And it ends with an inspiring quote:

1.      When the Going Gets Tough, the Why Gets You Going
2.      How to Become a Leader in Four Steps
3.      The Four Traits of a Rowan
When the Going Gets Tough, the Why Gets You Going
A page taken out of Simon Sinek’s book; but, then again, it’s the most important page.
The idea is simple: you shouldn’t spend most of your quite limited time on this planet doing things you don’t want or have no desire for.
If, on the contrary, you do something you really like, then you’ll always have a “why” to return to when, inevitably, things should go haywire.
Let us rephrase this: if you struggle to find an answer to the question “why you are doing this?” then, by all means, don’t do it.
How to Become a Leader in Four Steps
Leaders are made, not born.
You can become one if you just follow these four simple steps:
#1. Map the journey of your company from start to finish, bumps and everything;
#2. Manage your time well;
#3. Know your working tools: innovate, learn from other successful leaders, and never, ever stop being curious, reading quite about everything:
#4. Listen and learn: understand the others and see the world through their perspective; there’s a lot of empathy in business.
The Four Traits of a Rowan
A successful company, according to Wes Berry, is a company built around Rowans. And a Rowan is a guy who is capable of delivering a message to Garcia without asking too many questions. And 
is a book by Elbert Hubbard 
.
Anyway, a Rowan has four traits; these:
• focus
• perseverance
• research-oriented mind
• submissiveness to orders

“Big Things Have Small Beginnings Quotes”
Our Critical Review
is a sort of a Sinek/Collins/Hubbard mashup – so it should appeal to just about everyone who’s interested in discovering his/her why, becoming great, or finding a Rowan to lead his company.
With that being said, the book doesn’t really offer anything quite new in any area – so, if you feel like you’ve already absorbed everything those three guys can offer, then this book may feel a bit redundant.
But, hey, repetition is the mother of knowledge, right?"

How about a religious guide to wealth and success?
Catherine Ponder thinks she has the master key.
And this is your chance to learn from her:
Who Should Read “The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity”? And Why?
Long before positive thinking, affirmations and the Law of Attraction became parts of common knowledge, Catherine Ponder made them a thing, though using a few different words: radiation, attraction, visualization, circulation, and the Law of Creative Prosperity.
Readers of self-help New Thought books should definitely have a look, especially if they are religious; and those who believe in 
, shouldn’t think twice before buying this book.
There’s a reason why they call Ponder “the 
 among lady ministers.”
About Catherine Ponder
 is an American Unity Church minister and bestselling author of a few New Thought prosperity-themed books.
Born in 1927, Catherine Ponder received degrees in both business and education in North Carolina before being ordained as a minister in 1958. 
Her first ministry was in Birmingham, Alabama, after which she moved to Austin, Texas, and then to San Antonio. In 1973 she moved to Palm Desert, from where she heads global ministry, having founded Unity Church Worldwide, an affiliate of Unity Church.
Published in 1962, Ponder’s first book, 
, made her a national celebrity. Almost all of her other books treat the same subject: 
, 
, 
, 
, and a few others.
 “The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity PDF Summary”
Dear Minister, Please Redefine Prosperity for Me
You’re probably too young to remember it, but the relatively moderate eight-month Eisenhower Recession was a pretty big deal six decades ago.
Practically the only decline during the quarter-century-long economic boom after the Second World War, the Recession of 1958 caused many American businesses to shut down and many Americans to lose money.
A lot of money.
Catherine Ponder had barely started the fourth decade of her life back then, and she had just been ordained as a Unity Church Minister, merely two years after receiving degrees in business and education.
Naturally, due to this pretty unique combination of skills set against the backdrop of a worldwide recession, she received a lot of questions from the members of her congregation back in 1958.
The result?
A series of prosperity classes and, finally, in 1962, a debut book which made her pretty famous even among non-religious success-seekers.
Why?
Because unlike most religious people, Catherine Ponder didn’t despise money; and she offered her followers a pretty good reason why.
 “No one can serve two masters,” you’re probably already mentally quoting the Bible (Matthew 6:24). “Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”
True, says Ponder, but there’s a difference between 
 money and merely earning them. 
Money for money’s sake is bad and godless; but there’s nothing wrong with earning money while serving God.
In other words, a rich person 
 enter the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 19:23-26) if he isn’t attached to his money but to God; in fact, one could argue that it’s a bit more difficult for a poor one:
Visualize Your Desires
After doing away with the apparently false equation “money = sin,” Ponder introduces a new one, this time a correct one, the guiding principle of her book: “visualizations of desires = success.”
She’s not the first person – religious or non-religious – to proclaim this, but she is certainly one of the numbered few who did manage to popularize the concept long before 
turned it into a piece of common knowledge.
A decade and a half before 
, Ponder suggests that regular visualization of your biggest dreams will inevitably lead to their realization. 
Almost unsurprisingly, she finds evidence for this in the 
 and in James Allen’s seminal classic on the subject, 
:
In other words, thinking happy thoughts results in happy events; bad thoughts and doubts lead to misfortunes.
Write It Down, Make It Happen
Thinking big and good is merely the first step; writing your thoughts apparently further hacks this fireproof system.
In other words, even though God is an all-knowing being, he too needs some help: writing down your thoughts should help him turn them into reality more efficiently.
Another important thing: even though they say that the devil is in the details, Ponder is adamant that you must be specific when writing down your goals.
Don’t just say that you want to be rich; say that, for example, you want to earn 10 million dollars within the next half a decade.
And just like Jim Carrey – 
.
Ponder writes of a man – “a successful businessman, lecturer, and writer” – who “dared to write out hundreds of times some simple words as to how he wished things to be, rather than fretting about how they appeared at the moment.”
And she advises that you do the same.
Because if you are “content to idly drift in a stream of small events and small expectations,” chances are you probably will.
Ponder often asks people to write down and regularly use this basic statement as a starting point “to help expand and intensify their constructive desires”: “I desire the highest and best in life, and I now draw the highest and best to me.”
And then it’s time to sketch out a plan.
Or to quote Henriette Anne Klauser: 
!
Radiation and Attraction
Now, why should all of this work?
Because, Ponder says, there are some unwritten laws which guide the universe and the one which should interest you the most is the law of radiation and attraction.
To phrase it in the form of a beloved 
quote: “in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.” 
Radiate, and you will attract; or, in more common words, give, and you shall receive.
Yup, we just quoted the Bible yet again; or 
 – whichever one you prefer.
“If I could shout one message to the whole world regarding life’s secrets,” writes Catherine Ponder years before Joey “how you doin’” Tribbiani, “it would be this:”
Once again, Ponder makes known to her readers that this is neither a new idea nor one that should be dismissed by even the most skeptical of readers.
Ralph Waldo Emerson, she reminds us, “might have been describing this law of giving and receiving or radiation and attraction when he wrote ‘Great hearts send forth steadily the secret forces that incessantly draw great events, and wherever the mind of man goes, nature will accompany him, no matter what the path.’”
The trick is to be one of those with a great heart.
And if you are thinking and radiating great thoughts and expectancies of success and prosperity instead of failure, trouble, and limitation – then you 
.
Tithing and Circulation
We know what you’re thinking: the only thing more old-fashioned than the word “tithing”
is probably the practice of tithing.
In case you don’t know what we’re talking about, tithing is the practice of giving away the first tenth of your income to (most often) a religious organization.
But can I just give away things mentally, you say?
According to Ponder – no, you can not; and even God says so (Matthew 23:23): “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill, and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.”
There’s an even deeper reason for giving away parts of your income to an organization respecting God; that way, you prove to yourself that you’re still serving one Master, i.e., God.
And since He is the real source of your money – Moses says so: “Thou shalt remember Jehovah thy God, for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth” (Deuteronomy 8:18) – He’ll make sure to give twice of that amount back.
Don’t believe us? 
Well, 
, and he only got richer and richer for that; “God gave me my money,” said he every time someone asked him “why all this charity, John?” (which was, most probably, not once):
Key Lessons from “The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity”

2.      The Law of Creative Prosperity and Writing Down Your Desires
3.      Radiation, Attraction, Tithing, and Circulation
You Can’t Serve Two Masters – But You Can Be Rich and Still Serve Just One
According to the Bible (Matthew 6:24): “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”
This is usually taken to mean that being rich is incompatible with being a good God-serving man. And in case you have any doubts, there’s also that “eye of a needle” story:
“I tell you the truth,” says Jesus, “it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God” (Matthew 19:23-26).
Well, Catherine Ponder is a Unity Church Minister; and 
is a book about money.
How does she explain these two quotes?
Well, she says, neither of the two states that money is bad; both of them suggest that money is bad when it becomes an objective in itself.
In other words, if you are too attached to money and want to earn them for their sake, then you’ve forgotten about God; but if you still pray, go to church, and give some of your money away (preferably to God’s organizations on earth), then there’s nothing wrong in earning them.
The Law of Creative Prosperity and Writing Down Your Desires
“The law of creative prosperity,” writes Catherine Ponder, “is to take your deep-seated desires and, instead of suppressing them as impossible dreams, begin expressing them constructively through deciding what they really are, and then doing something very simple but very powerful about them: write them down!”
Why?
Because writing down your desires and formulating them in a list or a potential plan, clarifies the desires in your mind, and – to quote Ponder yet again – “the mind produces definite results only when it has been given definite ideas through which to work.”
Let’s rephrase Ponder for you: the Law of Creative Prosperity is how the Law of Attraction was called half a century ago; and it works best when you are the most specific.
Radiation, Attraction, Tithing, and Circulation
The law of creative prosperity is grounded in the basic law of the universe, says Ponder: in the end, you receive (attract) as much as you give (radiate).
That’s why Ponder advises her readers to give away a tenth of their income to the church, thereby proving that they are not serving Mammon but God.
This practice is called tithing and is, in itself, merely a corollary of a higher law: the law of circulation.
“There is basically one problem in life,” writes Ponder, “congestion. There is basically one solution: circulation.”

“Slowing Down to the Speed of Life PDF Summary”
“The feeling of being rushed saturates our entire way of life,” write Richard Carlson and Joseph Bailey in the introduction to 
. “We measure our success in life by our level of efficiency and our ability to stay on top of it all.”
In other words, even though we’ve developed so many “time savers as computers, fax machines, overnight delivery, voice mail, online services, or high-speed modems,” somehow, we’ve actually created more time stress than we’ve eliminated.
As its title suggests, 
is a manual on how to hack this stress-inducing dynamic age of ours using nothing but your mind, focus, and a few tricks and tweaks.
Its goals are, naturally manifold:
• To help you slow down and enjoy each moment through a few minor changes in your lifestyle;
• To teach you that, contrary to conventional wisdom, your productivity will actually increase when you slow down to the speed of life;
• To demonstrate to you that slowing down to the moment makes the ordinary – extraordinary, the serious – trivial, the unexpected – predictable;
• To equip you with a few tools which will make you a more satisfied and happier person.
But let’s delve a bit deeper.
Chapter 1: Slowing Down to the Moment
At the beginning of their book, Carlson and Bailey assert that there are at least six reasons why it is critical to slow down to the speed of life:
• Reduction of stress;
• Improved physical health;
• More present, intimate, and loving relationships;
• Heightened sensory awareness and enjoyment of the natural beauty around us;
• Greater peace of mind and serenity;
• Dramatically improved ability to be productive and creative and to stay focused.
And you can achieve all of these through the sheer power of thought; but not in that New Age “think positive” way, but by simply choosing when to harness the power of the right mode of thinking.
Because, as you know full well from Daniel Kahneman, 
. 
Carlson and Bailey refer to them as 
 and 
.
We use the former (which relies on memory) in situations when we know all variables; we use the latter (which relies on insight) when we have to face the unknown.
Many differences stem from this distinction; the table shows the most obvious ones:
Why is this important?
Because shifting between these modes of thinking is the foundation of your mental health; and recognizing their inner workings is the first step toward applying them in the right manner, i.e., navigating your thinking.
Chapter 2: Navigating Your Thinking
“When we slow down to the speed of life,” write Carlson and Bailey, “we tap into a peaceful feeling that permeates our entire being and way of life. Rather than constantly feeling rushed, hurried, and frustrated, we feel calm, joyful, and curious.”
In other words, it’s not like bad things don’t happen when we slow down; however, they don’t look as bad as when we’re speeded up.
A great way to understand this is through the metaphor of the baseball batter:
In the processing mode, all problems look like emergencies smothering you, just like a baseball ball traveling at you at 100 mph; however, in the free-flowing mode of thinking, the so-called emergencies look like “issues that need resolving or opportunities in disguise” – just like a ball slowly moving in your direction.
Carlson and Bailey believe that you’ll know when to shift between gears if you just listen to your feelings more attentively.
They claim that “feelings are a mechanism to let us know when our minds are operating too quickly and when it’s time to slow down.”
They describe them as internal buzzers which go off when we’re thinking in an unhealthy way.
Their goal: to help you get back to the moment!
Chapter 3: Getting Back to the Moment
The third chapter of 
is all about the four keys to getting back in the moment and the three pitfalls to avoid.
We know that your automatic reaction to this is “But, I listen all the time and it doesn’t help,” but the truth is “no, you’re not listening;” because listening means being present here and now – and not drifting away every five seconds or so. 
And you drift away because you allow your mind to use the wrong thinking mode; so it is helpful to be aware of 
 your thinking takes you out of the moment.
Carlson and Bailey point out two types of thinking which negate listening: 
 and 
.
So, from now on – 
 listen; don’t interpret or agree/disagree with the one who’s talking.
When you’re immediately interpreting something (or agreeing/disagreeing to something else) you’re actually using the processing power of your brain; however, if the problem is new, then you’re applying the wrong mode because the analytical brain is exclusively memory-based.
The solution?
Just accept that you don’t know what to do from time to time; this will unleash the power of your free-flowing thinking mode and that way you may reach a solution.
And you’ll be calm throughout.
This is self-explanatory. “Using the free-flowing mode of thinking will not turn you into an irresponsible, forgetful person,” write Carlson and Bailey. “On the contrary, as you slow down you will become less forgetful.”
The back burner of your mind works just like the back burner of your stove: you put the ingredients, stir them up, and then 
Whenever you happen upon a difficulty or a quandary on your path – just do that and, slowly, over time, your brain will come up with a solution. You’ll see.
People speed up their lives in three main ways; start avoiding them if you want to make your life a bit easier:
There are times when you are required to analyze your problems, but letting things go and accepting that life is unpredictable is the solution more often than not. 
So stop trying to force out a solution for every problem: this is your ego trying to predict life; just accept that you don’t know things and this frees up the creative intelligence buried deep inside you.
The processing mode is great for “planning, scheduling, calculating, memorizing, and recalling data;” but it doesn’t work well when you need to face the unknown.
Judging yourself every time you realize you are out of the moment is not an option; “self-acceptance is the route to slowing down to the moment.”
Many people are trapped in the past, not realizing that the present is all we have; if you want to be truly happy, you have no other option but to calmly accept 
.
Chapter 4: Stress and Your Innate Mental Health
A better title for this chapter would have been “Seven Essential Steps for Reducing Stress” because it is, in its entirety, dedicated to an analysis of each of these seven steps.
We believe that most of them are pretty easy to understand, so we’ll opt just for a list:
#1. Knowing that inner peace is possible, even in the midst of stressors;
#2. Having the humility to admit that “getting what you want” isn’t the ultimate answer;
#3. Learning not to deal head-on with or to struggle with problems;
#4. Understanding that stress originates in your thinking;
#5. Learning to not allow passing thoughts to turn into thought attacks;
#6. Avoiding the temptation to get caught up in the details;
#7. Lowering your tolerance for stress
Chapter 5: Being Present in Relationships
Being truly present in relationships is the key to intimacy, satisfaction, and effective, loving communication.
Or, to phrase that in another way: you can’t expect to have a good relationship if you are not living at the speed of life.
In fact – and think about this – the very reason why you like some of your friends or partner is that they manage to slow down the time for you.
The great news: you can be the one slowing the time in just about every single scenario.
You just need to be the inspirer of a heart-to-heart communication, aka follow this set of rules:
#1. Find your own bearings first; get into the free-flowing mode;
#2. Let go of any expectations of a particular outcome.
#3. Get permission from the other person;
#4. Speak from the heart;
#5. Listen with nothing on your mind;
#6. Stay on track; keep the tone respectful, warm, and compassionate.
Of course, sometimes, reality can be much more unbearable: you may have already lost hope that a relationship can be mended.
Worry not: Carlson and Bailey provide four guidelines which can help you turn your relationships around: 
#1. Find hope;
#2. Recognize your thinking;
#3. See past your habits to the innocence in your partner and in yourself;
#4. Forgive and forget.
Chapter 6: Peaceful Parenting
In the case of many people, there’s also that special form of relationships: parents/children relationships.
Many agree that we have basically threw them out the window as soon as we embraced computers and smartphones.
In this chapter, Carlson and Bailey analyze the problem, by first listing the effects of this form of speed-up parenting, then the benefits of slowing down and finally the strategies for slowing down parenting to the speed of life.
Here there are:
Several serious consequences follow from busy-minded, speeded-up parenting; here are the most important six among them:
#1. You become habitually reactive instead of responsive;
#2. You take negative behavior personally rather than seeing the innocence;
#3. Little events become front-page news;
#4. You miss the good times;
#5. You lose sight of your compassion;
#6. You expect too much from your children.
There are at least seven of these, functioning as sort of antidotes to the detrimental effects of speeded-up parenting:
#1. Your day-to-day experience will be heightened. Ordinary moments will become quite beautiful.
#2. You’ll become less reactive and more responsive.
#3. Your loving feelings and your appreciation for the gift of being a parent will increase;
#4. You will model peaceful slowed-down behavior;
#5. You’ll eliminate potential regrets about not having been there for your kids;
#6. Your wisdom will surface, and you’ll know what actions to take and what decisions to make to raise your kids to their full potential;
#7. You’ll stop thinking that parenting is so hard.
“There are seven proven strategies to slowing down and becoming a more relaxed, effective, and loving parent,” say Carlson and Bailey. “By implementing each of these strategies in your life, you will take valuable steps toward your goal of slowing down to the speed of life.”
Here they are:
#1. Become more oriented to the present moment;
#2. Learn to accept each moment as it arises;
#3. Keep your thought attacks to a minimum;
#4. Practice early thought recognition;
#5. See moods with compassion;
#6. Practice doing one thing at a time;
#7. Live in the free-flowing mode as much as possible.
Chapter 7: Working Smarter
Slowed-down working is all about a single motto: work smarter, not harder. And working smarter implies listening, reflecting and acting, rather than reacting out of habit:
In this chapter, Carlson and Bailey provide a mini-table that should easily illustrate what should be your objective at work: reaching an understanding which will raise you above the middle line.
Visionary
Dynamic
Self-Motivated
___________________________________________________
Stressed
Survival Oriented
Bureaucratic/Dysfunctional
“The lower the level of understanding,” they write, “the more difficult and stressful all the operations of work become – time management, relationships, decision making, meetings, and deadlines. As the understanding of employees moves above the line… work becomes more productive, fun, and creative with less energy – true success.”
Once again, the trick is not to get caught up in the whirlwind of deadlines and time-consumers; just like the greatest of sports players do, slow down the pace; and you’ll see things clearer.
Chapter 8: Enjoying Life
Everything – every single lesson and advice in this book – builds up to this: the only life worth living is the one you’ll enjoy in.
And you’ll never smell the roses if you’re racing at 100 mph on the highway.
Life is the moment you live in; the past is past, and the future hasn’t arrived at. Satisfaction in the present moment is the key to finding some enjoyment in life.
And the key to doing that: prevent your mind from drifting away.
Because when it does, boredom, tiredness, and frustrations come: you’re just too much absorbed in a moment (be it a past one or a future one) that isn’t the one you’re living in.
Do you really want to spend your life that way?
Key Lessons from “Slowing Down to the Speed of Life”
1.      Two Modes of Thinking 
2.      Slowing Down to the Speed of Life Is All About Navigating Your Thinking
3.      Four Keys to Getting Back in the Moment
Two Modes of Thinking 
The main premise of 
 is that there are two essentially different modes of thinking: the analytical (processing) mode and the creative (free-flowing) mode.
The former is based on memory, the latter one on insight; consequently, the former is effortful, linear, habitual, predictable, and works best when all the variables are known; the latter is easy, automatic, spontaneous, and inspired – and is the one you should use when dealing with the unknown.
Slowing Down to the Speed of Life Is All About Navigating Your Thinking
Unfortunately, we are not perfect, so we often inadvertently imprison ourselves within the wrong mode of thinking; this is not much different from using a hammer to polish a windshield – it will never work, because you’re using the wrong tool.
As we said above, you need your analytical thinking if you want to excel at the territory of the known: planning, scheduling, calculating, memorizing, and recalling data.
However, when you face the unpredictable it’s more than wrong to think that you’ll force your way to a solution: the analytical thinking is memory-based and, simply put, even if you can solve the new problem by reusing old knowledge, you’ll certainly find no enjoyment in this.
That’s why, as a good rule of thumb, whenever you realize that you’re dealing with a new problem, the best thing to do is just accept that you have no idea how to get out of it.
This is the cue which activates your free-flowing mode of thinking – and that, in general, slows down the world and offers a way out when none appear at the horizon.
Four Keys to Getting Back in the Moment
Slowing down to the speed of life is all about living in the moment. 
And there are four main strategies to achieve this:
#1. Listening without interpreting and/or (dis)agreeing;
#2. Accepting the fact that, more often than not, you 
 know;
#3. Having faith in the free-flowing mode;
#4. Putting your problems on the back burner and leaving them to cook out a solution for you.

The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up PDF Summary,https://blog.12min.com/the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-pdf/,,"9 min read ⌚ 
If anyone tells you that things have souls and feelings – I bet you call them CRAZY.
But take a look around your home. How many useless things can you name in 30 seconds? If you counted more than 5, I have bad news for you: Huston, YOU have a problem. It’s time to break up with some old useless stuff and make space for new ones.
This is all about 
’s book. Amazing topic, right?
I bet I caught your attention. But don’t worry! We all suffer from the same disease: having a box with memories, at least one drawer with “diverse things” and a garage full of objects that “might be useful someday”.
But Marie Kondo’s book – The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying – was written to put in order your thoughts, life, and stuff.
All you have to do is to start reading it!
 is a Japanese cleaning consultant – quite famous in her native country.
After this book appeared and was published in more than 30 countries, she’s considered a specialist in this area. The method she uses is called KonMari, a combination of her names.
Marie admits that she was fascinated by the subject of tidying from a very early age and was always looking for ways to improve this skill.
She managed to transform her passion (and obsession, some might say) for a clutter-free space, into an innovative business model and she offers consultancy to individual clients and companies that want to transform their lives.
This book is only one of the four she wrote on this particular subject, but it’s also the most well-known, outside Japan.
The structure of the book is very easy to follow, it only has 5 big chapters, each dealing with some specific topics.
The KonMari method consists of two big steps that you need to take in order to tidy your house. First, you need to gather all your belongings from one category and start discarding the things that you don’t need.
Living in a consumerist society, at first, you might be under the impression that you need everything. So, the key question is:
If the answer is yes, you can keep the item: 
The trick in applying this method is tidying by category.
This means that you should first start with your clothes, then books, then random objects and only in the end you should approach sentimental items like photos or letters.
By following this category rule, you won’t be tempted from the beginning to procrastinate or be absorbed into memories of the past, or become too emotional to continue the process.
An interesting topic that I found in this book was about the stuff that we receive as presents.
Many of us have old gifts that we don’t really like or use, but we don’t want to throw them away because we don’t want to hurt the feelings of the person that got us those presents.
Marie tells us that it’s ok to let go of those things. Their purpose in our lives was fulfilled and their mission is complete:
The author stresses the importance of tidying quickly and in one session because only this way it’s possible to have a complete shift of perspective:
You need to understand the difference between tidying and cleaning.
You will still need to clean your house on a regular basis. Only that now, because it has so much more free space and no clutter, this process will be easy and it will take much less time.
The key is putting the objects in their place after using them. How do we know where their place is?
You can designate a place for each object, but the design of the house itself will also help you: 
The author has very strong beliefs about the importance of folding properly. She says that if you stack your clothes one on top of the other, chances are, that the items at the bottom will never be used.
And I have to agree with her.
So she even made a few videos to teach us how to fold properly and how to arrange things in your closets and drawers so that you can see all of them when you open the doors.
The big advice isn’t to pile things up. Not even books.
Even if we tend to put them in a pile because it saves some space, the ones at the bottom of the pile will be forgotten and they are just occupying extra space.
For me, this part of the book was the most difficult to read. I love books and I have large shelves with books everywhere. I don’t feel like I could choose only 30 books to keep in my house. But I also understand a bit the author’s point of view.
I’m aware that I might never read some of the books that I purchased from impulse:
What I think might be a little difficult for some people from western societies to understand, is the rituals that Marie Kondo has with the objects.
She treats them as things that have a certain energy and even “feelings”, addresses them daily to show her gratitude and when she parts with an object it’s usually done in a small ceremony that she designs.
It was weird for me at first too, when I started reading that she greets the client’s houses and has a small dialogue with it, but after thinking about the 
 between Japan and the US or other western countries, I decided to be more open-minded and not to label these actions.
The secret to tidying is to sort by category. Because if you only clean one closet at a time, you will be surprised to discover that you have similar items in other closets as well.
So, for example with the clothes, search for all the items around the house and make a big pile in the middle of the room.
Only then, you can start taking each item in your hands and ask the magic question: 
?
Do the same with all categories (books, miscellaneous, photos) and then you will really have an organized house.
Be careful with the items that promise you extra storage. This means most clutter for you to stack.
You already have the necessary space for all the items that are important to you. You don’t need more space, you need to discard the items that have outlived their purpose or that bring you no joy.
Keeping a clutter-free house will help you reevaluate your entire life. You will gain clarity and perspective. Many of Marie Kondo’s clients said that their lives were completely changed after this process:
The key is to be ready for such a change and put some effort into this once in a lifetime process of tidying your house."
The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing Summary,https://blog.12min.com/the-22-immutable-laws-of-marketing-summary/,,"13 min read ⌚ 
: 
Are you working in Marketing/Management/Branding? Are you an entrepreneur or maybe you have an idea/a small business which you want to transform into a BIG idea/GREAT company?
If the answer is “YES” for at least one question from above, then “The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing” is one of the first books you MUST read and take notes!
“
g”, written by 
 and 
, offers you a complete guide. We can even call it 
, concisely structured (in 22 short chapters) and very easy to read.
Reading this book will help you focus on the really important issues, like the following: to choose the best decisions, to better invest your budget and to avoid mistakes, waste of time and money.
“The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing Summary”
The book presents the basic and constant rules which 
 and the failure of companies or products/services in the retail market.
Even if the book was published more than 20 years ago, the laws and the advice presented are still up to date as marketing and the consumers didn’t change (too much).
The book was written after more than 25 years of studying what works and what doesn’t work in marketing.
Each marketing law or affirmation presented within the book is accompanied by clear and real examples from the history of famous brands (such as IBM, Coca-Cola, Xerox, Starbucks, etc.) versus examples of companies that don’t exist anymore on the market.
According to the authors Al Ries and Jack Trout some companies have progressed and have become increasingly popular, have expanded the business lines or just increased their sales for a specific range because their 
 discovered and respected the marketing laws presented in the book.
Unfortunately, there were (or still are) other companies that stagnated their business or even went bankrupt because they didn’t take into consideration the same marketing 
.
#1: The Law of Leadership
Being the first in a market is better than having a better product than the competition.
People tend to remember who was the first man on the moon or the first aviator, but no one remembers who was the second.
Heineken was the first imported beer in the 
 and continues today to be number 1.
The same goes for Miller, the first light beer on the American market. By the way, being first does not help if the product or idea is not good.
#2: The Law of Category
Given the difficulty of leading a category whose competition already exists, it is better to create a new category of products and position your product in it.
The category does not have to be brutally different, 
 in the current category, create a variation where you can be unique.
In the example of the “imported beers” category, Heineken can be a leader, but you can be a leader in the “light imported beers” category, for example.
You may not be the first man to step on the moon, but you may be the first woman to step on the moon.
#3: The Law of the Mind
More important than being number 1 on the market, is being number 1 in the minds of consumers.
Being the pioneer of a market helps, after all, there is no competition for the minds of consumers. But, since the consumer is predisposed to a brand, it is very difficult to change it.
To be successful without spending 
, your goal is to find as many minds as possible yet without a formed opinion and work hard to form them.
#4: The Law of Perception
Marketing is not about products, their features, and their qualities but about people’s perceptions about that product.
There is no truth, and what we call truth is a perception that people create in their minds. In Japan, the biggest automaker is Honda, but in the US market, it is only in third place, behind Toyota and Nissan.
If the quality of a car is the most important to the consumer, the leader should be the same in both markets.
The curious point is that in Japan, 
. Therefore, the focus of marketing should always be directed at changing perceptions.
#5: The Law of Focus
The most powerful thing that exists in marketing is to own a word in the consumer’s mind.
Holding a specific context ensures that when people are exposed to this word, they connect it with the brand that owns the word. Shaving blades are synonymous with Gillette.
Computers are synonymous with IBM and Google means researching something.
#6: The Law of Exclusivity
Complementing the law of focus, it is impossible to take the word of another company.
Burger King tried to own the word “fast” but it was already McDonald’s, and so they failed and spent millions.
If a competitor already owns a phrase or word, do not try to use it but find something different and unique.
If you try to steal the phrase or word of your rival, your marketing efforts end up strengthening 
.
#7: The Law of the Ladder
Imagine the market as a ladder inside the consumer’s head. The first step is the market leader; the second is the second placed and so on.
Your marketing strategy depends on the step you take on the market ladder. In some product categories, the ladder may have seven rungs, and you need to know it to build your strategy. An efficient approach realistically matches your current position 
.
The American company Avis was the number two in the rental market vehicles and as announced with the slogan “the best in car rentals,” they were losing money because people did not believe in the campaign.
They now have greater profits when they took their second position and adopted the slogan “We try harder”, which characterized them in a manner befitting their position.
#8: The Law of Duality
In the long run, all marketing battles become about with only two competitors. Think McDonalds & Burger King. Nike & Reebok.
There will always be two brands struggling to win a category.
Companies that do not 
 should strive to establish themselves as the number 2 if they want to be successful in the long run.
#9: The Law of the Opposite
If you fight for second place, your strategy is set by the leader. Turn your strengths into weaknesses.
Do not try to be better and chase the opposite of him. 
, Pepsi decides to take off being “The choice of the new generation”.
In this way, you steal the attention of other competitors, after all, most people tend to fall between “the old trusted brand” and the “new brand that has arrived.”
#10: The Law of the Division
Over time, most categories fall into many segments, and each begins to act as an independent category.
Cars started as a single category, and today there are sports cars, luxury cars, utilities, etc.
Often companies do not understand this and believe that divisions are combining, 
.
Leading brands maintain their dominance by attacking new categories with new brands. When Honda tried to hit the luxury market, for example, it created a new brand, Acura.
#11: The Law of Perspective
Marketing results can only be appreciated in the long run. It is a mistake to sacrifice long-term planning to improve short-term outcomes.
Raising sales in the short term through the use of rebates can be positive for the company cashier, but educates consumers to buy when deals occur, and this reduces profits in the long run.
#12: The Law of Line Extension
Companies tend to give in to the temptation 
.
When this happens, the company ends up losing its focus and failing, as it starts to try to be everything to everyone, instead of focusing on what it knows how to do. In marketing, more is less.
The more products a company has, the lower the profits for each one.
And also less is more: the smaller the niche a brand wants to occupy, the higher its position in the minds of consumers within that focal area.
#13: The Law of Sacrifice
You need to focus on conquering something important. Companies that try to do everything end up failing. To progress, a company should not:
If a company is not prepared to make such sacrifices, it will never win.
#14: The Law of Attributes
For each attribute used in marketing by one company, there is an opposite attribute that the other can use effectively.
The reason for this tactic is obvious. It is challenging to win by replacing market leaders; So you should focus on serving any segment of the market that the leader ignores.
In this segment, there will always be enough space.
#15: The Law of Candor
Admit something wrong in your marketing and consumers will accept it positively.
That works by being unexpected and opens up the audience to your message.
Smart companies admit marketing failures and then 
.
The prospect should feel instantly in agreement with your apology. Otherwise, you will cause confusion.
#16: The Law of Singularity
In every marketing situation, there is always a movement that will bring substantial success.
Tuning an inefficient strategy does not return results. Working a little harder in executing an inefficient tactic does not produce results.
In almost every situation, there is an option that will bring excellent results. The challenge is to find this option and explore it. Competitors will have a weakness.
#17: The Law of Unpredictability
Trying to anticipate the plans of the competition is impossible, and their reaction can never be anticipated. Study general trends, but avoid drawing unfounded conclusions or overstating the facts.
You should also avoid betting that the future will be a repetition of the past. Just plan what to do should something unexpected happen and make your plans flexible to respond to market dynamics.
#18: The Law of Success
Success leads to arrogance, which leads to failure. Success tends to take objectivity away from marketers.
You have to be careful to avoid early success and failure in the future. Good specialists 
 and do not impose their point of view on others, but try to put themselves in the shoes of their clients.
Good people think and react the way the consumer would do when faced with an offer from their brand.
An interesting example is when Ken Olsen, a successful executive at DEC, was introduced to personal computing.
His success prevented him from seeing potential in that product, and DEC never participated in the personal computing revolution.
#19: The Law of Failure
Failure in marketing should be expected and accepted. In marketing, it is better to admit mistakes on time instead of letting the situation continue indefinitely.
No one in marketing will ever get it right.
An interesting example: once the mouthwash Listerine was attacked by the competitor called Scope.
They claimed in the campaign that the taste of Listerine was terrible and theirs was better.
Listerine answered the pitch, with the campaign “The taste you hate, 2 times a day”. That has caused consumers to consume more Listerine, and the company has won.
#20: The Law of Hype
 is often the opposite of what is reported in the press.
When sales are weak, companies give interviews and say they are OK. When they are strong, companies are silent.
Do not believe in articles generated by press services and pay attention to the small hidden details of what is happening in the market.
There is a big difference between attracting public attention and revolutionizing the market.
Some of the greatest hits in history, such as PC and fax, 
 in the beginning and attracted little press coverage, and some of the more exaggerated concepts, such as the videophone and the Segway, failed.
#21: The Law of Acceleration
Successful marketing plans follow trends, do not follow fads. Fads are short-term occurrences and trends are long-term changes. When a company accelerates too much and starts working with fads, it fails.
#22: The Law of Resources
Good ideas did not take off without the proper resources.
Even the best professional in the world will not get very far if they do not have the resources to reach out to the client.
You need to invest money to get there and even more, money 
.

 which are of high importance:
When you’re a potential customer, you remember which company launched firstly a product and you associate the product with the company.
Of course, not all the time the first products are the best ones and you will search the market for alternatives only if you’re from the category of those ‘few people’ who are looking for quality, who want to test a new product in order to do a comparison and then decide whose product you’ll remain a loyal customer.
There are marketers and managers who think that marketing is about products.
Actually, 
.
Further on, depending on the type of perceptions the products and the companies created in people’s mind, these ones are going to decide who is winning the battle.
This quote refers to the Law of Focus, a law that applies all the time in all areas.
As a company, you have to FOCUS: on how perceptions are formed, to focus on being first in the customer´s mind, to focus on facts and reality, to focus on your efforts.
. Focusing doesn’t mean to choose the most complicated ways of looking for too complex words to describe you, words that will not be remembered and the goal will not be achieved.
You have to find simple words that describe your company, your product, your business generally and when you find those words you have to protect them, to prove they are real in order to benefit from them and when those words are no longer useful, you must change the words.
The Law of Sacrifice applies not only in business, therefore If you want to be successful today, you should give something up.
Actually, The Law of Resources is more complex as there are several aspects to be considered: In order to promote an idea you have to be prepared to give away a lot for the funding, but at the same time – You have to use your idea to find the money, not the marketing help.
Also, not all ideas/products need a lot of money [A technical or business product has to raise less marketing money because the prospect list is shorter and media is less expensive.] Probably the best recipe/solution would be: [1. First get the idea, 2. then go get the money to exploit it.]
It’s important to keep in mind these 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing together with the authors’ examples, comparisons, and advice. For every law, Al Ries and Jack Trout present various short case studies that can be used as models for both situations:
– When the used strategy has revealed the best results;
– When the used strategy didn’t work as expected.
In conclusion, “The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing” it’s a must-read book for people working in marketing and other related areas.
For sure there are many other tips which can help in marketing, but the authors had chosen the fundamental laws of marketing, those 
laws which can be ‘violated at your own risk’ only!

Final Notes:
Understanding the principles that guide the consumer mind is critical to success in the modern world.
Marketing is a constant struggle for a piece of the mind and the customer’s attention, so you must understand how you can shape these perceptions and what perceptions and minds you should attack.
Many marketers want to be number one or emulate what the leader does, but in most cases, this is not the best way. Follow immutable laws, and you will have a winning strategy."

You’ve probably never met a Christian such as Donald Miller.
After all, his most famous book is subtitled “nonreligious thoughts on Christian spirituality.”
And, even more curiously, it is titled:
Who Should Read “Blue Like Jazz”? And Why?
Well, it is difficult to answer these questions because we feel that, even though written primarily for Christian audience, non-religious readers might find this book much more appealing than Christians; in fact, some Christians may even be offended by Donald Miller’s beliefs.
Read it if you think that faith is necessary, but that institutionalized religion has made it seem unfashionable for our atheist, postmodern times.
About Donald Miller
 is an American religious writer, public speaker, and business owner.
Even though he made his name as an unconventional advocate for faith in our times, Miller is now much more sought-after as a brand maker, being the CEO of StoryBrand, a company which helps businesses clarify their missions and messages.
In fact, his last book is titled 
 and is pretty different from the books with which he made his name: 
, 
, and 
“Blue Like Jazz PDF Summary”
Semi-autobiographical and hugely popular, Donald Miller’s second book, 
, is basically a collection of essays on the nature of God and Christianity.
There’s a sort of a narrative there, since most of these essays chronicle Miller’s personal experiences and the experiences of several of his friends – Mitch, Penny, Laura – all of them students at the liberal arts Reed college in Portland, Oregon, and all of them trying to understand their purpose being here and, consequently, their belief in something larger than human life.
After a more than successful Kickstarter campaign, 
was adapted into a movie by director Steve Taylor in 2012. If you haven’t watched it yet, here’s a trailer to pique your fancy:
Author’s Note
First of all, let’s get one thing straight: this book barely mentions jazz.
Then, why the title?
Well, it’s the arch-metaphor of the book, and it’s kind of difficult to understand it if you skip the author’s note.
We won’t allow that.
Here’s it in full:
So, in a way, Donald Miller says that God is like jazz because neither of them resolves, because neither of them is a well-rounded story with an ending; both of them go on, and go on – and it’s your job to build a relationship toward them.
More importantly, this author’s note implicitly uncovers Donald Miller’s belief that maybe seeing (or, in this case, reading about) his unique kind of love for God may make you love God as well.
Just like he fell in love with jazz after seeing somebody lovingly play it.
Chapter 1 | Beginnings: God on a Dirt Road Walking Toward Me
In the first chapter of 
, Donald Miller takes us on a guide through selected events from his childhood, all framed with (surprise! surprise!) quite a few daddy issues (his dad left him when he was young).
Consequently, you can understand why for Miller, the concept of 
 was a strange one: it both signified something which he lacked, and something of which he had a pretty different understanding than most of the other people.
“When I was introduced to the concept of God as Father,” he writes, “I imagined Him as a stiff, oily man who wanted to move into our house and share a bed with my mother. I can only remember this as a frightful and threatening idea.”
That’s why when he heard an Indian talking about the pantheistic nature of God, he realized the beauty of such a concept: if God was everywhere, he could swim in Him or have Him brush his face in a breeze.
And in a way, that’s what eventually happened.
“Years ago,” writes Miller, God “was a swinging speck in the distance; now He is close enough I can hear His singing. Soon I will see the lines on His face.”
Chapter 2 | Problems: What I Learned on Television
In this chapter, Donald really introduces to us for the first time. 
Unlike many other religious people, Donald is just like you, an average Joe. 
Meaning: he likes to be cool, he is not that uninterested in science (the chapter begins with his friend’s note that light exists outside of time), he cusses, he drinks, he smokes – and he wants to have sex when given the chance.
Also, he’s 
a Republican. In fact, in this chapter we see him joining his friend 
 on an anti-Bush rally; they have their reasons.
Further down the chapter, Donald informs us that, in his opinion, Christians are right: we have a sinful nature since it is much easier to do bad things than good ones.
“And there is something in that basic fact,” he concludes in discussion with his friend 
, “some little clue to the meaning of the universe.”
Chapter 3 | Magic: The Problem with Romeo
“I couldn’t give myself to Christianity,” writes Miller in chapter 3, “because it was a religion for the intellectually naive. In order to believe Christianity, you either had to reduce enormous theological absurdities into children’s stories or ignore them.”
“The entire thing,” he goes on, “seemed very difficult for my intellect to embrace. Now, none of this was quite defined; it was mostly taking place in my subconscious.”
However, the reason why Miller believed this were watered-down children’s Bibles which think that the essence of religion is the story; during his literature classes at Reed college, Donald Miller realized that it is not.
Or, at least, that this is merely the beginning.
There’s Copperfield saying that nothing is magical, and there’s Copperfield doing a trick nobody can explain. And everybody remains silent and awestruck for a while.
“I had always hated hearing about it because it seemed so entirely unfashionable a thing to believe, but it did explain things,” concludes Miller. “Maybe these unfashionable ideas were pointing at something mystical and true. And, perhaps, I was judging the idea, not by its merit, but by the fashionable or unfashionable delivery of the message.”
Chapter 4 | Shifts: Find a Penny
If you remember well, Reed College is a liberal arts college. And that means, well, read between the lines: drugs, alcohol, atheism – you name it. (“Some of the Christians in Portland talk about Reed College as if it is Hades.”)
It’s highly unfashionable to be a religious person among the artists of today; if not because of something else, because of the fact that religion bans about 90% of the things artists do.
In Chapter 4, Donald introduces us to two of his closest friends, who, in a way, seem like two very opposite sides of the same coin:
•
, the anti-religion “I can do what I want” student who is too smart for her own sake, barely capable of finding a class challenging enough for her intellect; and
• 
, a devout Christen who believes that God once spoke to her.
Chapter 5 | Faith: Penguin Sex
Well, this one was kind of expected: Laura falls into a severe state of depression.
“Boy stuff?” – Don asks. “No.” “School stuff?” Another “no.” “God stuff.” “I guess so, Don,” she says. Because, we guess, these are the only three reasons one might fall into depression, ha?
Anyway, this whole chapter consists of two attempts to convert Laura into a believer. The first attempt fails: “If God is real, He needs to happen to me,” says Laura to Don, who can’t explain his faith because, well, it is, by definition unexplainable.
“My belief in Jesus did not seem rational or scientific, and yet there was nothing I could do to separate myself from this belief.”
But then, in another discussion, Tony asks Don why does he believe at all, and Don starts talking about penguins and their mating rituals.
“They have this radar inside them that told them when and where to go, and none of it made any sense,” he says, “but they show up on the very day their babies are being born, and the radar always turns out to be right. I have a radar inside me that says to believe in Jesus. Somehow, penguin radar leads them perfectly well. Maybe it isn’t so foolish that I follow the radar that is inside of me.”
Of course, this somehow gets to Laura and, after some time, she sends Don a message:
“I read through the book of Matthew this evening,” it says. “I was up all night. I couldn’t stop reading so I read through Mark. This Jesus of yours is either a madman or the Son of God. Somewhere in the middle of Mark, I realized He was the Son of God. I suppose this makes me a Christian. I feel much better now.”
Chapter 6 | Redemption: The Sexy Carrots
“I found myself trying to love the right things without God’s help,” notes Don in this chapter, “and it was impossible.”
“I tried,” he goes on, “to go one week without thinking a negative thought about another human being, and I couldn’t do it. Before I tried that experiment, I thought I was a nice person, but after trying it, I realized I thought bad things about people all day long, and that, like Tony says, my natural desire was to love darkness.”
In a way, nothing helps Don makes sense of his life – or, even better, the ethical structure of the universe – in the absence of Jesus.
Not even rigorous self-discipline.
Chapter 7 | Grace: The Beggars’ Kingdom
“I was a fundamentalist Christian once,” starts chapter 7. “It lasted a summer.” 
Why?
Because, in the eyes of Don, self-discipline is almost impossible when there isn’t a goal behind it. It just makes you unhappy. After all, how can you be happy when you’re renouncing all of the worldly pleasures, and there’s no transcendental reason behind it?
It’s difficult even when there is: Don’s pastor Rick, “anguished by an inability to control his desires,” one evening “swallowed enough muscle relaxants and sleeping pills to kill three people.”
He didn’t die, of course, but he understood one important thing: God is not a loan shark, and he doesn’t ask anything in return but purity and humbleness.
“Your life is not your own,” Rick heard God speaking to him at that moment, “but you have been bought with a price.”
Chapter 8 | Gods: Our Tiny Invisible Friends
In this chapter, Don tells the story of a guy named 
, who Don believes offends everything sacred in this world because he uses “Islamic verbiage to make himself look spiritual, and yet he really hasn’t researched or subscribed to the faith as it presents itself.”
In other words, he’s using the Koran to make himself trendy and popular, and that, in itself is a reason enough to believe that he’s faking it.
Well, Tony, Don’s friend, states the obvious: just like this Trendy Christian Writer, we are raping our faith as well. We’re believing only to the point it suits us.
“When Tony said that,” Don writes, “it was as if truth came into the room and sat down with us. I felt as though Jesus were gently holding my head so He could work the plank out of my eye. Everything became clear.”
To be more precise, Don “realized in an instant that [he] desired false gods because Jesus wouldn’t jump through [his] hoops, and [he] realized that, like Tony, [his] faith was about image and ego, not about practicing spirituality.”
Chapter 9 | Change: New Starts at Ancient Faith
In chapter 9, Don relates us a sort of a religious experience in the Grand Canyon. 
Under the stars, he starts feeling what that Indian from the first chapter talks about and he starts talking to God:
“I’m sorry, God,” he shouts to the sky. “I’m sorry I got so confused about You, got so fake. I hope it’s not too late anymore. I don’t really know who I am, who You are, or what faith looks like. But if You want to talk, I’m here now.”
By the end of the evening, Don realizes something profound:
Chapter 10 | Belief: The Birth of Cool
“My most recent faith struggle,” writes Don at the beginning of his chapter, basically making the main point of the book, “is 
 one of intellect.”
In other words, he doesn’t think that there’s any point in discussing whether God exists or not. 
 who believe that he doesn’t and, moreover, believe that they can prove that he doesn’t; there are also other guys who believe the opposite. 
As far as Don is concerned, it really doesn’t matter one bit: “the argument stopped being about God a long time ago, and now it’s about who is smarter, and honestly I don’t care.”
Why?
Because, 
, we rarely do things for intellectual reasons; most of the time, we do them for emotional.
“If I walk away from Him,” Don writes, “and please pray that I never do, I will walk away for social reasons, identity reasons, deep emotional reasons, the same reasons that any of us do anything.”
Hence, you can be religious even if your outward appearance doesn’t show this; the question of belief is a deeper, more emotional, and more universal question than the question of coolness.
Chapter 11 | Confession: Coming Out of the Closet
Each year at Reed there’s a festival called Ren Fayre – an excuse for getting drunk, getting high, and, we guess, getting laid.
For some reason, Don and other Christens at the college decided that this festival is the best place for them to come out of the closet and confess their faith to others.
How?
By confessing the sins of God, Jesus, and the Church to the non-believers around.
Get it?
It’s the world turned upside-down.
And from the confessional, when asked by another non-religious student named Jake whether he 
 believes in Jesus, Don says it out loud: “Yes, I think I do. I have doubts at times, but mostly I do.”
“So many years before I had made amends to God,” concludes Don, “I had made amends to the world. I was somebody who was willing to share my faith. It felt kind of cool, kind of different. It was very relieving.”
Chapter 12 | Church: How I Go Without Getting Angry
“The church is a hospital for sinners,” wrote once Abigail Van Buren, “not a museum for saints.” As a review of 
notes, Miller, in a way doesn’t believe either.
To him, a church should be understood the very way Jesus described it: wherever two people are talking about him.
In fact, he ends this chapter by offering a three-step formula on how to find a church where you can go to without getting angry about the values it fails to represent nowadays:
• Pray that God will show you a church filled with people who share your interests and values;
• Go to the church God shows you;
• Don’t hold grudges against any other churches. God loves
Sounds easy enough, ha?
Chapter 13 | Romance: Meeting Girls Is Easy
The highlight of this chapter is a few-page-long quote from 
, a play by Donald Miller himself, “the story of one man’s life from birth to death, each scene delivered through a monologue with other actors silently acting out parts behind the narrator as he walks the audience through his life journey.”
In it, the husband whispers to his sleeping wife words of love which sound romantic, but which also include just too much of God and biblical references to be poignant.
Chapter 14 | Alone: Fifty-Three Years in Space
In this chapter, Miller reveals both his loneliness and how he used to think that being in love with someone is the only cure for it.
Nowadays, he doesn’t seem to believe that love is 
 opposite of loneliness, but merely 
 opposite, because he knows full well from the many moments passed in solitude that, when alone, a man craves for many things, a romantic partner being merely one of them.
“I think our society puts too much pressure on romantic love,” he writes, “and that is why so many romances fail. Romance can’t possibly carry all that we want it to.”
We believe Donald’s right.
There are also a few quite interesting paragraphs in this chapter dedicated to Donald Miller’s appreciation of Emily Dickinson’s poetry.
Now, that’s a long-lasting crash of Don’s.
“I don’t care why we get crushes on Emily Dickinson,” he writes. “It is a rite of passage for any thinking man. Any thinking American man.”
Chapter 15 | Community: Living with Freaks
Have you ever watched Dan Harmon’s 
(which, by the way, was amazing)?
If so, then you can guess what this chapter is all about: Donald moves in with some other guys and realizes why his pastor, Rick, doesn’t believe that faith is something you do alone.
In fact, Rick is the one who suggests that Don should live in a community: solitude is not something a man should experience, he thinks, you know, being a social being and all.
Of course, there are plenty of unplanned events and mishaps when you’re living in a community, but, in the end, it’s worth it.
Just like in marriage: you lose some freedom in the short term, but that’s the only way to earn that coveted victory lap after all is said and done.
Chapter 16 | Money: Thoughts on Paying Rent
You’ll understand why we have to quote the beginning of this chapter in full:
“I hate not having money,” goes on Donald Miller. “I hate not being able to go to a movie or out for coffee. I hate that feeling at the ATM when, after getting cash, the little receipt spits out, the one with the number on it, the telling number, the ever-low number that translates into how many days I have left to feel comfortable.”
A successful book and a movie later, we kind of guess that Donald’s quite better now. For one, we don’t think that the number on that receipt is low now.
Chapter 17 | Worship: The Mystical Wonder
“There are many ideas within Christian spirituality that contradict the facts of reality as I understand them,” writes Don tellingly. 
Now, he’s pretty aware that “a statement like this offends some Christians,” but he stands by it: “there are all sorts of things our hearts believe that don’t make any sense to our heads,” he goes on. “Love, for instance; we believe in love. Beauty. Jesus as God.”
Donald says that he doesn’t believe that one can be a true Christian without being a mystic. 
), belief is something beyond our grasp of reality, something inexpressible, something downright mystical. 
As far as Don is concerned, even if our theology is wrong (as it seems to him that it is), he firmly believes that God has everything figured out. 
And he respects this in wonder.
Because, he concludes, “wonder is that feeling we get when we let go of our silly answers, our mapped out rules that we want God to follow. I don’t think there is any better worship than wonder.”
Chapter 18 | Love: How to Really Love Other People
To our eyes, this is one of the most interesting chapters in the book. In it, Don reveals how living with a bunch of hippies during one summer taught him the 
difference between being good and bad.
Surprise, surprise – it has nothing to do with how you proclaim your faith to others; it has everything to do with how you practice it.
You see, there are many people who go to church and dub themselves Christians, but who are, deep down in them, bigots, racists, sexists, and would want to build a wall to keep Mexicans far from the USA.
We’re not putting words into Donald’s mouth: he really understands why liberals don’t like Republicans. 
The real issue in the Christian community, he says, is its conditionality. 
Simply put, if you are with us, we like you. However, if you have questions – “questions about whether the Bible was true or whether America was a good country or whether last week’s sermon was good” – you are not so loved.
Even worse, you are loved only in word, but not in practice.
“By toeing the party line you earned social dollars,” Donald writes, “by being yourself you did not. If you wanted to be valued, you became a clone.”
Now, how is that relevant to Donald living with hippies for a summer?
Well, he never felt more alive than that time. And he never felt more loved or loving. Because these people didn’t judge anyone because of their beliefs; even though non-religious, they were far more practicing in what the Bible states than preaching Christians.
A hippie would have no problems talking about everything with a Christian; a Christian, on the other hand, would have all sorts of problems even with a hippie living two houses from him.
Now, who’s the 
Christian there?
Chapter 19 | Love: How to Really Love Yourself
Now that we’ve learned how to 
love other people, it’s time to learn how to really love ourselves.
As far as Don was concerned, this was not an option: as we already explained above, the only way to accept Jesus is by being humble, and loving yourself seems to have arrogance written all over it.
However, after going to a therapist on account of his romantic troubles, Don realizes that the only alternative to loving yourself is hating yourself.
In other words, you do not love yourself merely because of you; you love yourself because of those around you. Only the ones who truly love themselves can love others, and only the ones who love others are accepted by God.
So, there it is: a great apology for being a narcissist.
Chapter 20 | Jesus: The Lines on His Face
Well, it’s safe to say that in this chapter you’ll encounter one of the most blasphemous sentences ever written by a preaching/acting Christian: “Sometimes I picture this Osama Bin Laden-looking Jesus talking with His friends around a fire…”
We may be ignorant, but we don’t remember ever reading someone comparing Jesus to Osama Bin Laden.
And yet – all you, offended Christian, shut your ears – this is a fairly correct 
, in the “Charlie Chaplin looks like Hitler” sense.
The problem?
After reading this sentence, we can’t seem to think of Osama without thinking of Jesus and vice versa. Hopefully, it will pass.
Anyway, in this last chapter, Donald returns once again to the introductory jazz/God comparison and expands it to include Christianity.
And this is a beautiful comparison to end our summary with:
Key Lessons from “Blue Like Jazz”
1.      Jesus Is Something You Should Experience, Not Something You Can Know
2.      A Church Is a Place Where People Share Your Interests and Values
3.      You Love Yourself So That You Can Love Others
Jesus Is Something You Should Experience, Not Something You Can Know
There’s no point in looking for a scientific explanation of God; even if it exists, it is, in a way, the antidote to the nature of belief.
We believe because of some inner radar which works the same way the inner radars of penguins do: 
, they 
 exactly what they should do to save the lives of their unborn children, and yet they never communicate it.
Well, this is how faith looks like. 
It is about wonder, not about science.
A Church Is a Place Where People Share Your Interests and Values
Consequently, Donald Miller wouldn’t blame you if you don’t like going to church. Many of the people there are simply not good people: they act as if they are religious, but deep in their hearts, they are not.
The best way to really start loving going to church is to find a church filled with people who share your interests and values.
And they don’t even have to be Christians: Donald Miller had one such experience with liberal booze-loving drug-using hippies.
You Love Yourself So That You Can Love Others
In order to love God, and let Him in your heart, you need to be humble; and yet, in order to be humble, you need to first learn to love yourself.
It is a bit of a paradox, but it makes sense.
Because the only alternative to loving yourself is hating yourself; and people who hate themselves are bitter and can’t love other people, let alone God.
Just think of it this way: you’ll help more people during a plane crash if you put your protection mask first and then start doing this for those around you.

Have you ever heard of client-centered therapy?
Well, Carl Rogers invented that!
And this is his best-known book:
Who Should Read “On Becoming A Person”? And Why?
is one of the ultimate psychology classics, and though written in a somewhat outdated style and a bit long (more than 400 pages) it’s certainly a must for everyone who wants to understand better human beings and psychotherapeutic practice.
The book has been a bestseller for about six decades – so, we’re pretty sure that it’s more than just another book on how to live a more fulfilled life.
It’s one of those which can actually help you attain it.
About Carl Rogers
 was an American psychologist, one of the founders of the client-centered approach to psychology and one of the most influential psychologists in American history. 
Unsurprisingly, he received
quite a few honors for his work, including the inaugural Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions in 1956 and the Award for Distinguished Professional Contributions to Psychology n 1972, both bestowed upon him by the American Psychological Association (APA).
Though revolutionary in his time, many of his ideas are nowadays widely accepted by psychologists worldwide.
In a recent study, Rogers was rated by colleagues to be both the sixth most eminent psychologist of the 20
 century and the second most respected clinician, only to Sigmund Freud.
“On Becoming A Person PDF Summary”
One of Carl Rogers best-known books, 
 
.
It’s also probably one of the very first psychology bestsellers: when it appeared in 1961 – Peter D. Kramer, M.D., writes in an “Introduction” to one of the newer editions of the book – it brought Rogers “unexpected national recognition.”
– Kramer goes on – “sold millions of copies when million was a rare number in publishing. Rogers was, for the decade that followed, the Psychologist of America, likely to be consulted by the press on any issue that concerned the mind, from creativity to self-knowledge to the national character.”
With that being said, it should be noted that Rogers didn’t expect such a thing; in fact, 
is not even a monograph, but a collection of articles penned by Rogers during a whole decade.
However, he did compile (and edited) them after he had discovered that he wasn’t writing for psychotherapists, but for “
 – nurses, housewives, people in the business world, priests, ministers, teachers, youth.”
This doesn’t mean that he didn’t consider psychotherapists to be people; on the contrary, in fact. And that is one of the main ideas of this book.
Let’s start with that one.
A New Type of Psychology: Humanistic Psychology
Let us guess: 
As far as you and everyone you know is concerned, psychotherapy is all about smart-looking men or women sitting in a chair opposite you and asking you questions until they can help you reach a solution to your problems – or, even better, offer you one.
Right?
Well, Carl Rogers thought otherwise.
You see, he realized, after a pretty long career as both a researcher and a clinician, that he – or anyone else for that matter – is simply not competent enough to solve other people’s problems. After all, everyone has them and what really puts one human being in a position above another one?
And then Rogers realized something else: whenever he had come across a problem in his life, what helped and healed him wasn’t a talk with someone acting from an above-position, but a conversation with one who is a peer in every sense of the word.
Even without trying really hard, we guess that you can easily recall a situation in which a long talk with a friend made you feel better, or, to use the wrong word for the sake of simplicity, 
.
That’s it, Rogers realized: all we need to live a more fulfilled life is to feel that our desires and actions are normal!
And the job of a psychotherapist should be that: to listen attentively and pass no judgment over his patients, thus creating a safe environment wherein one can really get in touch with his true self.
If that sounds like something every psychotherapist ever has said to you at least a couple of times, consider it Rogers’ fault.
“Certain ideas that Rogers championed,” writes Kramer, “have become so widely accepted that it is difficult to recall how fresh, even revolutionary, they were in their time.”
Rogers’ Influences: Humanist Psychology Is Existentialist Psychology
, it’s not like Rogers’ fell from Mars; on the contrary: they are deeply rooted within the philosophy of existentialism which emerged from the ashes of the two great wars; especially the second one.
Let’s have a look at them, so you can understand Rogers’ U-turn better.
We’ve already told you a thing or two about existentialism’s fundamental tenets while 
the central work by, arguably, the greatest existentialist philosopher of the 20
 century, Jean-Paul Sartre.
If you remember well, Sartre’s main idea was rather simply formulated: in humans, “existence precedes essence,” i.e., there is no blueprint on how a human should look like (essence), so we are in charge of the meaning of our own lives (existence).
In other words, we are “condemned to be free” (we can be whatever we want to), but we cage ourselves to exist according to certain principles (usually thrown at us by others), and we cage others by thinking that we know how 
should live their lives.
Why?
Because it’s easier for us to find excuses than to find ways; even though the former brings frustration, it is much more comfortable than the latter which always comes with a bit of fear.
Now, Sartre’s ideas were themselves inspired by the work of a great 19
-century Danish philosopher with a complicated name, Søren Kierkegaard.
In Kierkegaard’s eyes – recaps Rogers – because we can choose to be what we want to, “the most common despair is to be in despair at not choosing, or willing, to be oneself.” And you can do even worse: “the deepest form of despair is to choose ‘to be another than himself.’” 
Consequently, “to will to be that self which one truly is, is indeed the opposite of despair,” and (Rogers adds) “this choice is the deepest responsibility of man.”
In other words (because Kierkegaard’s and Rogers’ are somewhat unnecessarily complicated), you can be whatever you want to be, but only if you choose to be 
, you will not feel despair at your choice.
How does this help a psychotherapist who wants to help a patient?
To understand that, we should probably introduce you to the idea of “confirming the other” developed by Martin Buber, an existentialist philosopher and mystic from the University of Jerusalem.
Buber says in a paragraph quoted (and edited) by Carl Rogers: “Confirming means… accepting the whole potentiality of the other… I can recognize in him, know in him, the person he has been… 
 to become… I confirm him in myself, and then in him, in relation to this potentiality that … can now be developed, can evolve.”
Once again – unnecessarily complicated; let us rephrase it in Rogers’ words: “If I accept the other person as something fixed, already diagnosed and classified, already shaped by his past, then I am doing my part to confirm this limited hypothesis. If I accept him as a process of becoming, then I am doing what I can to confirm or make real his potentialities.”
In other words, if you can be whatever you want to be, what you are at the moment is exactly what you are 
 (statistically, let’s say that’s only about 1% of your potential realized and you still have 99% to go).
And a psychotherapist needs to start from there.
He/she needs to see you as 
 in the process of becoming, and not as a finished product; in that way, only he can help you: not by dealing with your past problems, but by dealing with the possibilities that lie in your future; and they are all but endless.
The Laws of Human Nature: Rogers’ Shift
We guess that you can already understand what kind of a shift Rogers introduced in the world of psychology; but one can understand this better if we compare his approach to the approach practiced by his predecessors.
And, of course, most of them were influenced either by 
 or 
.
And, according to the fathers of psychology, there’s something disturbing deep within each and every one of us; and it is a psychotherapist’s job to help an individual either to do away with these dark impulses (Freud) or to embrace them and incorporate them in a healthier way in his being (Jung).
“On the whole,” writes Rogers, “the viewpoint of the professional worker as well as the layman is that man as he is, in his basic nature, had best be kept under control or under cover or both.”
However, during his practice, Rogers discovered something so “foreign to our present culture” that even he was aware that it would probably never be accepted by the mainstream practice.
Namely, that “the innermost core of man’s nature, the deepest layers of his personality, the base of his ‘animal nature,’ is positive in nature – is basically socialized, forward-moving, rational and realistic.”
Rogers quotes two authors – Abraham Maslow and Ashley Montagu – as the “solitary voices” of protest against the widely accepted notion that “man is irrational, unsocialized, destructive of others and self.”
Why?
Because according to Montagu, “cooperation, rather than struggle, is the basic law of human life;” and according to Maslow, “the anti-social emotions – hostility, jealousy, etc. – result from frustration of more basic impulses for love and security and belonging, which are in themselves desirable.”
Rogers’ model of dealing with patients stems from these findings.
Let the Patient Lead
Now, if men are essentially good, then it’s not your job as a psychotherapist to 
 them but to 
them.
And 
 does mean – almost always – 
 judging, even if some things seem to you wrong or stupid. 
This is how the famous (and now widely practiced) client-centered approach came to be.
“I become less and less inclined,” writes Rogers, “to hurry in to fix things, to set goals, to mold people, to manipulate and push them in the way that I would like them to go. I am much more content simply to be myself and to let another person be himself.”
And Rogers went even a step further: the idea that the therapist should stay calm no matter what was a foreign one to him, because honesty is possible only in good relationships and good relationships are always about two honest people – and not about a person spilling his guts out and a doll bereaved of feelings nodding opposite him.
At one place in the book, Rogers sums up most of his ideas about how a good consultant/client relationship looks like and what it does “into one statement.”
We believe it deserves to be quoted in full:
I believe,” concludes Rogers, “that this statement holds whether I am speaking of my relationship with a client, with a group of students or staff members, with my family or children. It seems to me that we have here a general hypothesis which offers exciting possibilities for the development of creative, adaptive, autonomous persons.”
Becoming a Person
What Rogers realized in his years of treating patients was that the real problem with each and every one of them was always one and the same: they weren’t living in a way which expresses who they are. 
All of them locked themselves within the confines of an existence which is both foreign to them, and, even worse, final.
The trick is to realize that you have never 
, but you are always 
; and that, like every other process, 
 is messy, filled with contradictory feelings and beliefs that must be freely analyzed through and not forcefully controlled by someone on the outside.
In a way, the latter is the real source for the problem:
Key Lessons from “On Becoming A Person”
1.      Humanist Psychology Is Existentialist Psychology
2.      Good Relationships Breed Good People
3.      The Good Life Is About Becoming, and Becoming Is About Fulfilling Your Potential
Humanist Psychology Is Existentialist Psychology
Carl Rogers is widely credited as one of the founders of the humanist (client-centered approach) to psychology.
The idea behind it is deeply rooted within the philosophy of existentialism (Kierkegaard, Buber, Sartre): namely, that we are free to choose to become whoever we want to, but are frustrated because we are trapped in an existence which doesn’t express us.
Consequently, it’s the job of a psychotherapist to listen to his/her patient, rather than trying to fix him/her.
Because only in the first case the psychotherapist truly believes that the person sitting next to him is a person, someone in the process of becoming something, and not someone whose existence is already fixed.
By doing the latter, regular psychotherapists don’t understand the main of people’s problems: their inauthentic lives.
Good Relationships Breed Good People
So as to help a patient (or a lover or a child or a friend), it is the job of a psychotherapist (or a partner or a parent or a colleague) to create a safe environment.
And the safe environment can be created only within the “genuineness and transparency” of a good and trusting relationship.
This means, among other things, not acting, listening attentively, refrain from judging, being as honest as possible; or, in a sentence, it means being yourself and letting the others be themselves as well.
Even if you are a psychotherapist. 
The Good Life Is About Becoming, and Becoming Is About Fulfilling Your Potential

Want to learn more about the history of South India?
Here’s a great book covering the last four centuries of its history:
.
Who Should Read “Modern South India”? And Why?
tells the story of all four cultures which dominate South India’s landscape (Kannada, Malayali, Tamil, and Telugu) through most of the last four centuries.
If you want to become more acquainted with this history, then you will do no wrong buying and reading this book: written by Rajmohan Gandhi, it’s both researched in detail and engagingly written.
And if you like it, we warmly recommend that you consult two more books: even though not as ambitious as Gandhi’s masterpiece,

About Rajmohan Gandhi
 is an Indian historian, biographer, and politician.
Now 83 years old, Gandhi worked (until 2012) as a research professor at the Center for South Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA, and continues to teach as a visiting professor at Michigan State University and at the Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar.
Grandson of both Mahatma Gandhi (through his father) and Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari (through his wife’s father), he is a prolific and admired author of more than a dozen books, many of which have been awarded.
Between 1990 and 1992, Gandhi was also a member of the upper house of the Indian Parliament.

“Modern South India PDF Summary”
“The sounds and flavors of the land south of the Vindhyas – temple bells, coffee and jasmine, coconut and tamarind, delicious dosai and appams – are familiar to many, but its history is relatively unknown,” implies one of India’s most beloved and most widely acclaimed biographers, Rajmohan Gandhi, in the “Introduction” to his historical overview of South India.
And why is that?
Gandhi lists no less than three reasons:
And that’s where 
comes in, a monumental study which, in about 600 pages, paints – in vivid colors and details – four tumultuous centuries of South Indian history, filled with everything from civil wars to freedom struggles, from sultans to political leaders and even rockets (yes, rockets!)
In essence – by Gandhi’s own admission – it is “a story of facets of four powerful cultures – Kannada, Malayali, Tamil and Telugu,” but he doesn’t forget that it is also a story of the cultures which have influenced and shaped them: the Kodagu, Konkani, Marathi, Oriya, Tulu, and some “older and possibly more indigenous cultures often seen as ‘tribal’, as well as cultures originating in other parts of India and the world.” 
Let’s delve a bit deeper.
XVI-XVII Century
As Rajmohan Gandhi explains in the “Preface” of 
, he was asked to do a study of this sort by Indian novelist and publisher David Davidar, who didn’t forget to remind Gandhi that after the publication in 1955 of K. A. Nilakanta Sastri’s classic work, 
, “not many have tried to convey South India’s story in a single study.”
Quite appropriately, 
 begins where Sastri’s work ends, recapping in its first chapter (“Sails on the Horizon: 1498 – 1697)” the rise and fall of the Vijayanagara Empire (1336 – 1646) and the Deccan Sultanates (1527 – 1686).
And, of course, the narrative begins somewhere around 23 January 1565 when the last great medieval empire of the South, the Vijayanagara Empire, is soundly defeated by the combined forces of the Muslim Deccan Sultanates of Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Golconda and Bidar.
Now, you’d expect that after such a deciding victory the Deccan Sultanates would do something with it (like, we don’t know, maybe start a new, even more powerful empire), but it seems that neither of the dynasties got the lesson from the victory (namely, that force lies in unity).
After the victory at Talikota, the Deccan Sultanates reverted to in-fighting, and this made them an easy target for the Mughal Empire, a Mongol empire directly descended from both Timur and Genghis Khan.
At the same time, the Maratha Empire is also on the rise, as are a few other nayakas, princes, chieftains and poligars which rule with different regions across the South Indian plateau.
Of course, the competition raging between all of these makes the job quite easy for the Europeans, mostly the British and the French.
And we all know what would happen next, don’t we?
XVIII Century
But wait a second!
Before the British defeated the French and conquered India, they still had to face a formidable enemy in the southern Deccan.
Founded at the very beginning of the XV century, the Kingdom of Mysore expanded its territories throughout the XVII century, especially during the rule of Narasaraja Wodeyar I and Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar.
By the beginning of the XVIII century, the Kingdom of Mysore had already much of what is now Southern Karnataka under its control.
However, it reached the height of its powers in the second half of this century, first under the rule of Haidar Ali, and then – and especially – under the rule of his pretty controversial son Tipu Sultan, who managed to annex parts of present-day Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
“Tipu and his father Haidar were central to the 18th century’s second half,” says Gandhi. “Between them, they provided a stable 38-year-rule that not only brought economic progress to a large portion of southern India, and it almost foiled Britain’s conquest.”
And really: by the time Haidar came to power (1761), the Europeans had already asserted their presence on the continent, pitting nominally independent rulers against each other and dividing the Mughal and the Maratha Empire piece by piece.
Haidar – though an illiterate man, in retrospect, a military, and economics genius – allied with the French and fought against the British the First and the Second Anglo-Mysore Wars.
During the latter, the British (and the world) first saw (and were humbled by) the employment of rocket artillery in the history of warfare.
The Mysorean rockets served as the direct basis for the technology behind the Congreve rocket, which the British used effectively during the Napoleonic wars.
Haidar Ali died from cancer during the Second Anglo-Mysore War (1782), leaving his son Tipu Sultan on the throne in the middle of a bloody war. 
Even though in 1783, a preliminary peace between France and Britain was agreed (leaving the Kingdom of Mysore ally-less), Tipu did manage to hold his ground on his own, winning several important victories against the British, and negotiating the 
 which basically meant that he had won.
Of course, this made the British a bit angry, and during the next two Anglo-Mysore Wars, they got their revenge, killing Tipu Sultan himself, who was killed on 4 May 1799 during the Siege of Srirangapatna, while he was defending his fortress.
XIX Century
Three things before we proceed:
First of all, when we say the British, we do mean the British East India Company which, at around this time, “
;” if that’s not enough, the East India Company also employed an army of about 300,000 soldiers – 
!
Secondly, Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan were not without serious failings; especially the latter one, who is more than controversial nowadays, for his treatment of Christians and Hindus – as well as for his tyrannical behavior.
But thirdly and finally, both Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan – as well as, say, subsequent freedom fighters such as Pazhassi Raja and Velu Thampi – (to quote Gandhi) “deserve a frank study of their lives in their times, not labels handy for squabbles in our times.”
In other words, Tipu Sultan is part of India’s history and, in his time, he was part of a war against a foreign enemy.
Unfortunately, the last one:
The most important thing that happened during the XIX century as far as South Indi (and India) is concerned was the handing of its rule from a private company (the East India Company) to the British monarchy itself (“A Gift for the Queen”).
Thus, Queen Victoria became the “Empress of India,” and the 
.
XX Century
If the nineteenth century saw South India fighting against the British rule in no more than a few sporadic, isolated military campaigns led by nawabs and rajas, the XX century saw the unification of the subcontinent under the leadership of several prominent leaders and parties.
In addition to the influential national parties such as the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League, the Indians united in quite a few regional ones as well, such as the Andhra Mahajana Sabha, the Justice Party, and the Dravida Kazhagam. 
Here Gandhi treats his readers with quite a few engaging biographical sketches of prominent South Indian leaders (mostly socialists and communists) such as Annie Besant, EMS, C. N. Annadurai, Periyar E. V. Ramasamy, Perumal Varadarajulu Naidu, Kumaraswami Kamaraj, as well as his very own grandfather (through his wife), C. Rajagopalachari.
Unsurprisingly, Gandhi is at his best when he chronicles this period, especially the Vaikom Satyagraha of 1942-25 which occurred five years before Gandhi’s famous Salt March and which delivered the first major blow against the notion of untouchability in Hindu Society – especially in South India.
“In the Malayalam country,” informs us Rajmohan, “Vaikom helped the freedom and social justice movements to join hands. Elsewhere in India, the news from Vaikom confronted insulated caste Hindus with the ugly realities of untouchability and unapproachability.”
After India won its independence, new states were formed along linguistic lines (Tamil, Kannada, Malayali, Telugu, respectively) on the South: Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, and Andhra. 
Gandhi ends his book with a look at the new generation of political leaders and optimism as to what the future holds.

The History of South India Is the History of Four Powerful Cultures… And Then Some
As Rajmohan Gandhi says, the history of South India is the history of four powerful cultures: Kannada, Malayali, Tamil, and Telugu.
In fact, modern-day South India is divided along the lines of these cultures in four states: Tamil Nadu (Tamil), Karnataka (Kannada), Kerala (Malayalam) and Andhra Pradesh (Telugu).
However, even more than that, it’s also a story of many other Indian cultures which have influenced and shaped them: the Kodagu, Konkani, Marathi, Oriya, Tulu and even some older and tribal ones.
South India Was Ruled by Many Rulers – and That’s Why the British Conquered It
After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, the last of the great medieval empires of the South, South India was divided between many kingdoms and rulers: the Deccan Sultanates, the Mughal Empire, the Maratha Empire, and the Kingdom of Mysore were merely the most prominent.
The Europeans – most notably, the British East India Company – used the competitiveness and the enmity between these kingdoms to conquer them, first by intrigue and then by force.
Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore were the last two rulers from the South to oppose the British; after the death of the latter during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, Queen Victoria could proudly call herself the Queen of India.
South India: Unity in Uniqueness
According to Rajmohan Gandhi, there are at least three reasons why South India can be seen as a uniquely unified region of India.
First of all, there are the geographical and the linguistic threads, which “have given the South Indian peninsula its unity and distinctiveness. Because of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, European countries like Portugal, Holland, England, and France impacted the South in ways not experienced by northern and central India.”
Secondly, “the South’s major languages have Dravidian rather than Sanskritic roots, even though their vocabularies have been enriched by borrowings from Sanskrit and elsewhere.”
Thirdly, and finally, “the Dravidian/Aryan question resonates, not necessarily divisively, in many southern minds.”
Be that as it may, to conclude with Gandhi’s words, “fascination with the history of one’s neighborhood can harmonize with interest in the national story.”

When the author of a book is a Nobel-Prize winner, you don’t ask questions such as the one above; you simply sit down and read the book, because in it you’ll inevitably find the utmost borders of human knowledge and accomplishments.
In this case, it’s even better: “an engaging and witty memoir,” 
is “a profoundly human story written with honesty and humility,” not merely about the discoveries (in this case, the structure of the ribosome), but also about how discoveries are reached.
“Anyone who is captivated by an absorbing story well told,” writes a

He enrolled as a grad student at the UCSP and spent the next thirty years uncovering its structure and the functions of the ribosome, winning numerous prizes for his work. In 2009, he shared – with Thomas A. Steitz and Ada Yonath – the greatest one of them all, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
Even though knighted by the Queen for his services to science in 2012, Ramakrishnan almost never uses the honorific title “Sir.”

, 
is in a pretty good company.
And though we’ll try our best, we kinda feel that our summary – or any summary for that matter – can’t do enough justice to this kind of a gem.
Beginnings in Physics and an Unexpected Change of Plans
“When I left India,” writes Venki Ramakrishnan at the beginning of his book, “I had my heart set on becoming a theoretical physicist.”
“I was nineteen years old,” he goes on,” and had just graduated from Baroda University. It was customary to stay on to get a master’s degree in India before going abroad for a Ph.D., but I was eager to go to America as soon as I could.”
Why, you ask?
Well, for three reasons.
The first one – and the most obvious one – 
, the United States 
 a land of opportunities for young people. 
The second one – and the most compelling one – Venki’s parents had already gone to the US because his father was taking a short sabbatical at the University of Illinois in Urbana.
The third one – and the one you’ll remember best – because the USA was the home of 
 and a hero for Venki and about a million other science-loving people out there. 
Three things happened afterward.
First, in 1975, Ramakrishnan married Vera Rosenberry, a recently divorced woman with a daughter; “at the age of twenty-three,” he writes, “I found myself married and the stepfather of a five-year-old girl.”
Then, a year later, he obtained a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Physics from Ohio University.
And then, as soon as the latter happened, Venki realized that he doesn’t want to do “boring and incremental calculations that wouldn’t result in any real advance in understanding.”
So, he abruptly changed his career focus and enrolled as a graduate student in biology at the University of California, San Diego.
The reason?
Well, why don’t we say a couple of words about it in the next section.
The Ribosome, the Ultimate Code-Cracker
“Mention DNA and almost everyone nods in understanding,” writes somewhat despondently Ramakrishnan. 
“We all know – or think we know – what DNA means. It determines the essence of who we are and what we pass on to our children. DNA has become a metaphor for the fundamental qualities of almost anything. ‘It is not in their DNA,’ we say, even when referring to a corporation.”
“But mention the word ribosome,” Venki goes on, “and you will usually be met with a blank stare, even by most scientists.”
This is both pointless and scandalous, because to DNA, the ribosome is what your video codec is to the 1s and 0s which are packed in the mkv or avi file: the thing which makes sense of it all.
Or, in other words, the ribosome is the DNA interpreter, decoder, the molecular machine.
The Gene Machine.
Defined in strictly biological terms, the ribosome is an organelle which can be found in absolutely every living cell, from bacteria to humans. It is essential for all life on Earth, and it is, consequently, as old; the information stored in the DNA molecules would be irrelevant in the absence of a ribosome to decode it.
Writing of its importance, Ramakrishnan shares an interesting anecdote:
“The discovery of the ribosome and its role in making proteins,” concludes Ramakrishnan, “is the culmination of one of the great triumphs of modern biology.”
Now, by the late 1970s (when Venki Ramakrishnan decided to change his career focus), the structure of the DNA had already been determined and solved; but how the body decodes and uses this information to pass on traits from generation to generation was barely understood.
In fact, just about then – in 1974 more specifically – George Emil Palade, Albert Claude, and Christian de Duve were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of the ribosome (something Palade first did about two decades before).
Ramakrishnan started working on something else though: in the laboratory of Mauricio Montal, Venki studied “proteins that let ions pass through the thin membranes of lipids that envelop all cells.”
However, one day, in the October 1976 issue of the 
, he came across an article that would change his life.
The article – ‘Neutron-scattering Studies of the Ribosome,’ signed by Donald M. Engelman and Peter B. Moore, – “described how to locate the many different proteins on the ribosome using neutron scattering – a technique known to physicists but hardly used in biology.”
Ramakrishnan immediately wrote Don, but unfortunately, he had no vacancies left at the time of his inquiry. Fortunately, the neighboring laboratory of Peter Moore had one – and the rest, as they say, is history.
Especially since – and interestingly enough – Moore’s close collaborator was Thomas Steitz, Ramakrishnan’s fiercest competitor in the race for the discovery of the structure of the ribosome.
Four decades later, and the guys would end up sharing the Nobel Prize.
The Race and the Competitors
But first, let us introduce you to the nature of this race and the competitors at the beginning of Ramakrishnan’s biology career.
The objective: to obtain three-dimensional crystals or images of ribosomal particles; the prospect: somewhat bleak; the existing methods: producing splotches rather than images (in fact, Venki and his colleagues explicitly and scathingly referred to crystallography as “blobology.”)
And then a pediatrician named Hasko Paradies appeared out of nowhere, publishing an article in which he claimed to have crystallized tRNA before anyone else. 
It turned out that he was lying, but, as Ramakrishnan writes, “often, just being told something is possible breaks down a huge psychological barrier and spurs people to try things.”
And the people who started trying things? 
Well, dozens mentioned and hundreds of unmentioned and unsung heroes.
Here are the main guys:
• 
, “a tall, courteous, and somewhat reserved person with a deep love of art and literature… working away in relative isolation at the Wadsworth Center in Albany for years;” Frank won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2017;
• 
, “the Sage of Santa Cruz,” a bearded, long-haired jeans-wearing guy with a fondness for motorcycles and Ferraris and the “demeanor of a mellow, pot-smoking California hippie;”
• 
, “the Ferrari Boy,” called that way because he rejoiced at the early maps of the ribosome just like a teenager would at the keys of a Ferrari;
• 
; the guy already mentioned, “a burly, imposing figure” with Amish-like chin-strap beard and immense knowledge; direct in his approach and married to Joan A. Steitz, “a top molecular biologist;”
• 
, an Israeli crystallographer with “exactly the right combination of ambition and tenacity” needed for the project; and
• 
, the “dark horse” of the race.
The Politics of Recognition and the Collaborative Nature of Science
In 2009, the last three – sometime rivals, most of the time friends – would end up sharing the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. 
“I thought you had to be really smart to win one of those,” said Vera Ramakrishnan to the author upon finding out the news.
But there may be a deeper point behind this joke.
Ramakrishnan constantly insists on the fact that it’s merely a coincidence that these three – and not some other three guys – won the Nobel Prize.
Why?
Because science is a constant pursuit by the multitude and not something that an individual does. 
True, Ramakrishnan worked tirelessly, but so did thousands and thousands of other people, whose studies opened his – or his colleagues’ – eyes to some new discovery.

Key Lessons from “Gene Machine”
1.      The Ribosome Is a DNA Decoder
2.      Venki Ramakrishnan is a Physicist – and He Won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry
3.      Science Is a Collaborative Field
The Ribosome Is a DNA Decoder
The DNA is a blueprint for all life: it’s where the important all the genetic instructions are written.
However, without the ribosome, that information would be unusable: the ribosome is a molecular machine which reads the info from the DNA and turns the code into proteins and, therefore, us.
In other words, a DNA without a ribosome is pretty much a BD without a Blu-ray Disc player: neither is enough in itself, but, in combination, they work wonders!
Venki Ramakrishnan is a Physicist – and He Won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry
In 1976, Venki Ramakrishnan obtained a Ph.D. in physics from Ohio University. 
Most people would consider that the summit of their scientific pursuit, but for Venki it was merely the beginning of something 
: he enrolled as a grad student in biology at the UCSD, in an attempt to find a practical use for his physics-related knowledge.
In 2009, Ramakrishnan won a Nobel Prize – in Chemistry!
Science Is a Collaborative Field
Venkatraman Ramakrishnan shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with two other people – Ada Yonath and Thomas A. Steitz.
Nothing surprising: not merely because, since about two decades ago, it’s only normal for these scientific Nobel Prizes to be awarded to three people, but also because that makes much sense.
“If I have seen further,” wrote Newton in 1675, “it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.”
Ramakrishnan admits that he was in that position exactly; and that even if he hadn’t existed, someone else would have discovered what he did.
And that’s the collaborative nature of science for you.

Owing to a diving board accident while in his first year at Harvard Medical School, Krauthammer became permanently paralyzed from the waist down.
After graduating as a psychiatrist – and even discovering and describing identify a variant of manic depression called secondary mania – he joined the Carter administration as a director of psychiatric research, and started writing speeches for Walter Mondale in 1980.
Soon he became a prominent columnist, winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1987 for his Washington Post columns. A leading neoconservative voice, in the last years of his life, Krauthammer was a regular panelist on Fox.

A Note to Readers
“I have been uncharacteristically silent these past ten months” – thus began Charles Krauthammer’s June 8, 2018 column for 
. “I had thought that silence would soon be coming to an end,” it went on, “but I’m afraid I must tell you now that fate has decided on a different course for me.”
And that course, unfortunately, was one of no return: after a long and hard fight with a cancerous tumor in his abdomen, Charles Krauthammer surrendered on June 21, 2018, less than two weeks after this column was published.
Behind him, he left a legacy of thousands and thousands of columns, “witty and insightful” enough to earn him a Pulitzer Prize for Commentary back in 1987, and timeless and adored so much to be compiled in a 2018 
bestseller by his only son, Daniel.
is that book – and it is one which you’ll enjoy it regardless of whether you agree with Krauthammer or not.
Because, even his bitter rivals agree, he was a true journalist, one of the very last, a man who sincerely believed in his duty to be an honest and keen commentator of national and world issues.
“I believe that the pursuit of truth and right ideas through 
 is a noble undertaking,” Krauthammer writes touchingly in the penultimate paragraph of his final column. “I am grateful to have played a small role in the conversations that have helped guide this extraordinary nation’s destiny.”
“I leave this life with no regrets,” he ends. “It was a wonderful life – full and complete with the great loves and great endeavors that make it worth living. I am sad to leave, but I leave with the knowledge that I lived the life that I intended.”
The Contents of the Book
A leading neoconservative voice in the journalistic world, Charles Krauthammer began his career as a psychiatrist. 
And an exceptional one, mind you: after becoming the first one to identify a variant of manic depression (now called secondary mania), in 1978, Krauthammer became a director of psychiatric research under the Carter administration.
Soon enough, he started writing speeches for Vice President Walter Mondale, and, before too long, he found his true calling: writing.
Over the next thirty years, Krauthammer became a nationwide celebrity as the author of a column for 
, a contributing editor to 
, and, most recently, a nightly panelist on Fox’s 
.
Compiled by him before his death – and edited by his son, Daniel – 
 is (to quote its blurb) “a powerful collection of the influential columnist’s most important works.”
Though eclectic and covering many different subjects spanning three decades, the columns are divided into eighteen chapters, which are then grouped into five major parts:
• Part I: What a Piece of Work Is Man (comprising chapters 1-6);
• Part II: Man and Society (chapters 7-11);
• Part III: Politics, Foreign and Domestic (chapters 12-15);
• Part IV: Competing Visions: America’s Role in the Course of World History (chapters 16-17); and
• Part V: Speaking in the First Person (chapter 18).
All in all, 
encompasses 92 columns by Charles Krauthammer, framed between a fitting “Introduction” and a heartbreaking “Eulogy” by his son, Daniel.
Since it would be impossible to summarize all of them in a couple of thousand words, we’ve opted to summarize a few – of course, the ones which piqued our fancy the most.
Praise for the Conservatives
As we implied above, Charles Krauthammer began his writing career as a liberal, writing speeches for Democrat Vice President Walter Mondale. 
True, he was a staunch anti-communist and (after all, he was Jewish) a somewhat radical pro-Israeli advocate, but, nevertheless, he was far from being a neoconservative; a 
 compares Krauthammer’s early political positions to those of Democrat Washington Senator, Henry M. “Scoop” Jackson.
In time, however, Krauthammer’s beliefs moved to the right and, just like a hero of his (Irving Kristol) and quite a few other journalists (David Horowitz, James Burnham, Whittaker Chambers), he became a leading public intellectual of American conservationism. 
Naturally, in 
,
you’ll find quite a few columns on important figures of the conservative movement; even more naturally, we chose to make these columns the focus of our summary. 
As you’ll see, you’ll expect some of Krauthammer’s assessments, but you’ll inevitably be surprised by others.
Krauthammer begins his June 14, 2004, 
column titled as above with a rhetorical question: “What made Ronald Reagan the greatest president of the second half of the 20th century?”
The implication: Ronald Reagan, the icon of the conservative movement, 
unquestionably the greatest president of the second half of the 20
 century, regardless of your opinion.
And – to go back to the introductory question – there are reasons why he deserves this title.
The main one?
Luck.
“Luck in his looks, luck in his voice, luck in his smile, luck in his choice of mate;” also, luck in the fact that he was a President in a time of trouble and boasted with both “courage and conviction” to get the USA back on track.
“The ungenerous would say he had a great presidency but was not a great man,” writes Krauthammer. “That follows the tradition of his opponents who throughout his career consistently underestimated him, disdaining him as a good actor, a 
 simpleton who could read scripts written for him by others.”
“In fact,” he concludes, “Reagan frustrated his biographers because he was so complex – a free-market egalitarian, an intellectually serious nonintellectual, an ideologue with great tactical flexibility.”
And above all, a man of integrity who stood firmly for “a set of ideas.” And, in Krauthammer’s belief, there is no better definition of presidential greatness.
According to Krauthammer, Reagan is also “one of the great liberators of the 20
 century.” The others: Roosevelt, Churchill and – surprise, surprise – Pope John Paul II.
If Reagan managed to inspire a spark in Vaclav Havel and Natan Sharansky by predicting the end of communism when few could ever predict such an outcome, Pope John Paull II “sparked, tended, and fanned the flames of freedom in Poland and the rest of Eastern Europe” until 
.
Subtitled “The Power of Faith,” Krauthammer’s April 4, 2005, 
obituary for Pope John Paul II is a demonstration of how sincere faith sometimes beats sheer power:
If we need to describe Bush in one sentence, Krauthammer’s choice is “He kept us safe.”
True, he says, Bush failed to bring democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq – blame some of this on Obama, though – but he did create “the entire anti-terror infrastructure that continues to keep us safe.”
And that will probably remain his legacy in the mind of Krauthammer, who compares Bush to Truman.
“Like Bush,” he writes, “Harry Truman left office widely scorned, largely because of the inconclusive war he left behind… I suspect history will similarly see Bush as the man who, by trial and error but also with prescience and principle, established the structures that will take us through another long twilight struggle and enable us to prevail.”
Donald Trump – inevitably – is mentioned in quite a few of Charles Krauthammer’s columns and his views of him tend to change from one to the next.
In one of his last columns on Trump – published on June 9, 2017, in 
– in which he weighs in on Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, Krauthammer shows both the extent of his intellect and the depth of his integrity.
Even though, at least suggesting by its title, the article is primarily aimed at the journalists on the left who hyperbolize each decision made by Trump to absurd heights (this is what calls the Trump Derangement Syndrome), Krauthammer isn’t interested in defending Trump’s decision 
(as the rightists usually do).
In fact, he blames the left for mixing “legitimate policy differences on the one hand and signs of psychic pathology on the other” and, thus, really doing nobody a favor.
“Trump was elected to do politically incorrect – and needed – things like withdrawing from Paris,” he writes. “He was not elected to do crazy things, starting with his tweets. If he cannot distinguish between the two, Trump Derangement Syndrome will only become epidemic.”
By the way, Trump’s decision to withdraw from Paris was a necessary one, says Krauthammer, since “the Paris agreement itself was a huge failure” from the start, punishing the West for its “two-century head start on industrialization” and giving a pass to China and India.
Though Krauthammer isn’t that convinced on the climate change consensus, he is all for a climate-change pact, but one much different than the Paris Agreement.
In his words, one that will be “strong and enforceable, that would impose relatively uniform demands on China, India, the United States, the European Union and any others willing to join.”
Thank You, Isaiah Berlin
First published on November 14, 1997, in 
– so, nine days after the death of Isaiah Berlin – this article (both a personal essay and a heartfelt eulogy to one of the greatest men of the 20
 century) is one of our favorites in the book.
In It, Krauthammer remembers how he was “cured of the stupidities of youth” by Isaiah Berlin’s 
, a book he describes as “a great argument for pluralism.”
Published in 1969 (the year of grand theories and grand aspirations: liberation, revolution, historical inevitability) the book got Krauthammer back on the right track by showing him that what all those great seducers (
, Trotsky, Mao, Ho, Castro, 
) had in common was a 
 idea.
Not one 
 unifying idea as the ones in the parenthesis above, but a unifying idea full stop.
And the problem with unifying ideas – i.e., grand narratives – is quite simple: they are an antidote to human freedom:
“
 is available everywhere,” writes Krauthammer. “Buy it. Make your children read it before they go to college, the last redoubt of romantic neo-Marxism. If they think the book is obvious, you have raised them well. If they don’t, Berlin will challenge their complacency.”
Misc: Chess and Madness
Unsurprisingly, Krauthammer’s book is filled with quite a few gems of columns, some of which concern his family, others miscellaneous current events, and yet a third group some trivial human pursuits such as sports (baseball, golf, sailing).
Since he was an avid chess player, Krauthammer couldn’t resist writing a few chess-related columns: “Genius, Insanity, Innocence” (a review of the movie 
), “Man vs. Computer: Still a Match” (an analysis of the Garry Kasparov – X3D Fritz 2003 chess match) and, the most interesting of them all, “The Tyranny of Chess.”
In all of these columns, Krauthammer notes how genius and madness are connected and how it is almost unsurprising that chess players tend to go mad from time to time.
Well, one of them, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, a former chess champion, and the president of FIDE from 1995 to 2018, became (back in 1993) the first president of Kalmykia, a Caspian Russian republic.
And he remained on the position for the next two decades (you can guess how), doing what you would expect from a chess player: almost everything wrong.
Among other things (some of them really, really bad) he turned Kalmykia (a Godforsaken, impoverished country “where the sheep outnumber the people two to one”) into the world’s first “chess state:”
“Compulsory chess classes in all schools. Prime-time chess on TV. And in the midst of crushing poverty, a just-erected “Chess City,” a surreal Potemkin village topped by a five-story glass-pavilioned chess palace where Ilyumzhinov has just staged an international chess tournament.”
The result?
Well, now “the world knows what chess players have known all along: a passion for chess, like a drug addiction or a criminal record, should be automatic disqualification for any serious public activity.”
“Column writing excepted, of course,” Krauthammer wittily quips.
Key Lessons from “The Point of It All”
1.      Monistic Ideas Negate Freedom by Definition
2.      Don’t Underestimate the Legacy of the Conservatives
3.      You Can’t Pigeonhole a Great Mind
Monistic Ideas Negate Freedom by Definition
This is not an idea by Krauthammer, but it is nevertheless an idea he stood by during his whole life; perhaps because it is one which utterly changed his worldview when he was a 19-year-old boy.
It comes from Isaiah Berlin’s 
, in which (among other things) one of the leading intellectuals of the 20
 century argues that monistic ideas such as Marxism fail to understand that human liberty is all about having a multitude of options.
Putting any idea – even egalitarianism – above all others would inevitably result in the enslavement – and maybe even death – of millions of people.
Don’t Underestimate the Legacy of the Conservatives
Charles Krauthammer deems Ronald Reagan the greatest president of the second half of the 20
 century and thinks that George Bush and even Donald Trump did some things right.
Also, though a Jew, he believes that Pope John Paul II was one of the great liberators of the 20
 century, together with the aforementioned Reagan, Roosevelt, and Churchill.
If it wasn’t for these guys, he says, we would be living in a dystopian communist society; so don’t forget that.
You Can’t Pigeonhole a Great Mind
Though a leading neoconservative voice, Krauthammer is ambivalent on more than one occasion. 
For example, he does think that Trump is a bit mad (not as far as his policy decision are concerned but in relation to his use of Twitter), and supports abortion and gay marriage.
Also, though not that convinced by the science behind the climate change, he advocates for a strong international agreement and urges the USA to unilaterally start burning fewer fossils.

(At least in his own self-deprecating opinion.)
Who Should Read “Al Franken, Giant of the Senate”? And Why?
Al Franken was an 
 writer and performer on the show for most of the two decades between 1975 and 1995 and, subsequently, the US Senator for Minnesota from 2009 to 2018.
And this is his memoir, which combines an interesting story with his political views and opinions, all of them wrapped up in a layer of funny anecdotes narrated in the funniest way possible.
So, there’s something for everybody here: those who want to know more about Al Franken, those who want to hear what was going on behind the scenes while 
 was becoming 
, and those who want to see what goes on in the Senate. 
Finally, those who simply want to laugh and amuse themselves on the subway while traveling to work.
About Al Franken
 is an American comedian, politician, and author; he served as the US Senator for Minnesota from 2009 to 2018.
Al Franken first became known as part of the comedic duo Franken & Davis; the pair was recruited as two of the original writers on 
, where Franken spent the two decades between 1975 and 1995.
After leaving the show, he published five books on mainly political topics – 
, and 
 – and decided to run for Senator in 2008, a race he won by 312 votes.
Four years after being reelected in 2014, Franken decided to resign from his position in 2018, after several women came out with allegations of sexual misconduct.
“Al Franken Giant of the Senate PDF Summary”
Why I’m a Democrat
Even though we’re talking about a memoir here, 
, pretty unconventionally, opens with a chapter titled “Why I’m a Democrat.”
There’s hardly any info as far as Al Franken’s upbringing is concerned; and even that is interpreted only through the lens of the question above.
Of course, the book starts with a joke – a great one, in fact: “I was born in the house I built myself with my own two hands. I’m sorry. That’s not true. I got that from my official Senate website. We really should change that. Let me start over.” 
Al Franken was born in 1951, 43 years after his father Joe Franken was born in New York City, and 27 after 
 father – and Al’s grandfather – Otto, a German immigrant, died from tuberculosis.
In 1955, when Al was merely 4 years old, Joe moved the family from New Jersey to a little town in southern Minnesota called Albert Lea to open a quilting factory.
He wasn’t a good businessman, says Al, but he was a great dad; and they were a pretty close family.
Anyway, Joe was a liberal Republican (endangered species nowadays), and Al’s mother was a Democrat. However, after the Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater – a guy who had voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act – Joe Franken switched sides; and, naturally, so did Al.
“LBJ was right when he told an aide that Democrats would lose the South for a generation when he signed that bill,” writes Franken. “But he got my dad. And, therefore, me.”
Franken’s political credo is simple: “Democrats aren’t just the party of equality for all – we’re the party of opportunity for all.”
And his inspiration is Paul Wellstone, 
 credo was: “We all do better when we all do better.”
Saturday Night Life: The Drug Part
In retrospect, it seems that Al Franken was into comedy ever since his early childhood; however, he really got into it after he met Tom Davis at The Blake School.
The duo – which specialized in political satire – was adored at Blake and first performed on stage at the Brave New Workshop theater.
In 1975, Franken and Davis got their big break: they were chosen as one of the original writers of the 
.
Franken recounts his wonderful years with the SNL in three separate chapters: “Not the Drug Part,” “The Drug Part,” and “The Part Where I Live.”
“Not the Drug Part” includes several wonderful and poignant memories – both on the scene and behind it; “The Drug Part” reveals the darker side of it.
“You can’t do a ninety-minute live comedy show week after week and do cocaine,” the SNLers would say and sound convincing in the face of a few early accusations.
The truth, however, was scarier: “many on the show thought that you can’t do a ninety-minute live comedy show week after week 
 doing cocaine.”
That all changed after the death of John Belushi; however, after Chris Farley – a man loved by absolutely everyone on the show – got into serious trouble, “everyone at SNL understood all too well.”
Both Tom Davis and Franken’s very own wife Franni Bryson struggled with addiction, and – as Al says – “addiction can take an unimaginable toll on the people who love addicts; and that’s true even when the addicts in question find recovery.”
in fact – possibly a little-known fact – the experience Franken had with Franni’s early recovery from alcoholism became the basis for the 1994 movie 
, which Franken co-wrote with his friend (and Oscar winner) Ron Bass.
Comedy & Politics
Back in 1992, during the first night of the Republican National Convention in Houston, Ben Stein and Al Franken commented live Pat Buchanan’s “religious war” speech.
“It was disorienting to watch a comedy broadcast,” wrote 
at the end of the year, “that almost incidentally told more truth and offered more insight than most networks and newspapers and at the same time was so much more comfortable to watch.”
Nowadays, of course, this is not disorienting, but quite commonplace: Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah are not just successful comedians anymore but also respected political figures.
Why?
Because “night after night, year after year, they offered more truth and insight than most real TV news.”
And, if we look back – thinks Franken – we’d realize that this has always been so: “Before 
 and 
, there was 
 with Bill Maher. And before 
, there was 
. And before that, there was something Jonathan Swift wrote about the Potato Famine.”
(By the way, if you haven’t, you should really read 
: three years after 
, he became the original political satirist).
After leaving 
Franken’s published a few politically engaged books whose success gave him the idea that he could make a transition from writing political satire to running for a place in the Senate.
Though topical, some of the books – 
 and 
 – are still read and enjoyed.
The Senate
On Valentine’s Day 2007, Al Franken formally announced his candidacy for US Senate from Minnesota; he won the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nomination with two-thirds of the vote.
His Republican opponent was Norm Coleman, who had been US Senator for Minnesota during the previous eight years.
As you probably know full well, the Minnesota 2008 Senate race was one of the strangest in history. Not because of all the accusations and scandals, but because of an eight-month-long recount process. 
In the end, Franken won the race by 312 votes out of 3,000,000 cast – a margin of less than 0.01%. It was easier six years later when Franken won reelection with 53.2% of the vote over his Republican challenger Mike McFadden. 
Franken tried his best to prepare for a job he never thought he’d work.
“Like Trump,” writes the SNL writer, “I had no previous experience in elected office. Unlike Trump, I was actually bothered by my lack of experience. I compensated for this by absorbing as much information in as much detail as I could.”
And so he did.
The book goes over some length on Franken’s beliefs and proposals on many issues, ranging from gun control and health care (say, improving the dental care for Native American children) to education and climate change (“Virtually everyone in the world believes that climate change is real and is caused by human beings, except Republicans in the United States.”)
The main problem with these issues?
They need bipartisan support.
Meaning, Franken needs to find a way to communicate with his colleagues even when this is impossible.
He’s looking at you, Ted Cruz, “the Dwight Schrute of the Senate.”
“I like Ted Cruz more than most of my other colleagues like Ted Cruz,” writes Franken. “And I hate Ted Cruz.”
Lies and the Lying Liar Who Got Himself Elected President
As far as Al Franken is concerned, the problem with America today is not lies, but the fact that exposing them means virtually nothing to anyone:
“I firmly believe,” states Franken, “that you can draw a straight line from Rush Limbaugh through Fox News through present-day websites like Breitbart and the explosion in ‘fake news’ that played such a big role in the 2016 campaign. And that’s how someone like Trump can wind up in the Oval Office.”
When it comes to Trump, Franken goes all out attack and withholds none of the usual blows: he blames him for stupidity and notes that sometimes it seems as if he has some sort of mental health problem.
Hence his promise: “I’m going to keep fighting as hard as I can in the coming months and years to protect our children, our values, and our future from Donald Trump.”
The Aftermath
came out on May 30, 2017; just a few months later – on November 16 – Leeann Tweeden accused Franken of groping; during the following few days, at least five other women said something similar.
On December 7, 2017, Franken announced that he was resigning his Senate seat, even though he maintains that some of these allegations are “simply not true,” while others he remembers “very differently.”
In his resignation speech, Franken also noted the irony that Trump remains President despite his publicly known comments from the 
 tape.
Either way, Franken’s promise stays; only now he’ll have to keep fighting from somewhere other than the Senate.

became a cultural phenomenon, allegations surfaced according to which “some of the cast and the writers of the show were smoking dope and snorting cocaine.”
Even though the SNLers claimed that it’s difficult to do a ninety-minute live show week after week under the influence of cocaine, most of them thought the opposite was true.
Namely, that it was impossible to do this 
cocaine.
However, after John Belushi died and Chris Farley got into serious trouble, suddenly, drugs stopped being funny; however, it would be too late for Farley who’d die as well – at the same age and the same way as his hero, Belushi.
There Is No Better Political Commentator Than a Comedian
Geoffrey Hill, possibly the greatest English-language poet of the past few decades, claimed once in an interview that he’d rejoice if his poems have the same effect on people as Ken Dodd’s shows.
Apparently, he was right on track: comedians such as Stewart, Colbert, Oliver, and Noah are now much more than comedians – they are creators of the public opinion.
And that’s great – because people like to laugh at stupidity, and because most of the politicians are stupid.
And serious political debates are too PC to hit the mark.
In other words: if you want the truth about the political situation in any country, go ask a comedian.

It may be – to quote Christopher Buckley from

“Scratch that ‘may,’” adds Buckley, and we concur. “It surely is. This is a genuinely funny book, often hilarious.”

Ray Bradbury Biography
 was an American writer, most famous for his SF, horror, and mystery novels and short stories.
One of the most celebrated American authors of the 20
 century, Bradbury is considered “the writer most responsible for bringing modern science fiction into the literary mainstream.”
In addition to 
, Bradbury is also the author of 
and 
– all of them adapted in one way or another.

Plot
“Where books are burned,” wrote German poet Heinrich Heine back in 1823,” “in the end, people will also be burned.”
More than a century later, his prediction eerily came true in his very own country.
And a few years after the Second World War, in the McCarthy era, American writer Ray Bradbury was deeply concerned that history might repeat itself in his very own country, the land of the free.
So as
to find an esthetic outlet for this concern, Bradbury wrote
, quite possibly the best book ever written on the subject of books and book burning.
Set in an unspecified city – probably somewhere in the American Midwest – at the end of the second millennium (but written as if set in a fairly distant future), the book presents a future American society in which most books are outlawed and burned by specially trained “firemen.”
Hence the title and the famous tagline of the book: “Fahrenheit 451 – the temperature at which book paper catches fire, and burns…”
The novel is divided into three parts: “The Hearth and the Salamander,” “The Sieve and the Sand,” and “Burning Bright.”
Let’s summarize them!
Part I: The Hearth and the Salamander
, the main protagonist of 
, is one of the “firemen” mentioned above. However, unlike real firemen, he and his coworkers are tasked with starting, rather than putting out fires.
Employed by the state to burn the possessions of those who own and read outlawed books, Guy Montag is married to 
, a woman “thin as a praying mantis from dieting, her hair burnt by chemicals to a brittle straw, and her flesh like white bacon.”
One night, while returning from work, Guy meets his neighbor, 
, who is,
in her own and her uncle’s words, “seventeen and insane.” 
She is also not that popular among her peers, because she’s asking their teachers “why” instead of “how” and because she’s just too open-minded and free-spirited for everyone’s sake.
After having a brief discussion with her, Montag returns to his house and finds Millie overdosed on sleeping pills.
He calls for medical help and, soon, two pretty insensitive and hard-hearted EMTs arrive at the house of the Montag’s. 
They pump Millie’s stomach and drain her poisoned blood; it is the future, so they can replace it with new one; hence, in a way, they resurrect her.
After the EMTs leave, the now somewhat calmed Montag goes outside and overhears a discussion between Clarisse and her family about the point of living in an illiterate, hedonistic society.
For the first time in his life, Montag starts to wonder about things, overwhelmed by Clarisse’s whys and his wife’s near-death experience.
Unsurprisingly, Montag starts welcoming the conversations with Clarisse who faithfully meets him every night as he comes home from work. 
However, just as he starts enjoying them, Clarisse suddenly disappears.
Soon after Clarisse’s disappearance, Guy Montag and his colleagues are tasked with burning the books in possession of an old woman.
Though they ransack the house, the old woman seems unbothered:
The woman chooses to burn herself together with her books to the utter amazement of Guy Montag, who steals one book at the last moment and manages to hide it under his pillow at home.
Struggling to fall asleep, Montag asks Millie whether she has heard anything about Clarisse; she tells him that she has died four days ago, hit by a speeding car and that her family has subsequently moved away.
Guy awakens the next morning, ill and confused.
However, Millie seems more interested in the “parlor wall” entertainment in her living room (TV shows on flat-panel TVs) than in taking care of him.
Montag suggests taking a break from his job, but Millie is not a great fan of the idea, because that might mean losing the house and her parlor walls. 
After some time, sensing that something’s seriously wrong with Guy, his fire chief 
arrives at his house to see how he’s doing.
Obviously trained for occasions such as this, Captain Beatty gives Guy a famous speech covering the history of the world up to that point.
And for the first time we understand how books lost their value and what is actually going on in Guy Montag’s head:
With the advent of radio and television, Captain Beatty explains, “things began to have mass. . . and because they had mass, they became simpler . . . Once, books appealed to a few people, here, there, everywhere. They could afford to be different. The world was roomy. But then the world got full of eyes and elbows and mouths. Double, triple, quadruple population. Films and radios, magazines, books leveled down to a sort of paste pudding norm.”
Over the course of the following few decades, to accommodate short attention spans and due to many protests by minority groups over controversial and outdated content in the books, classics were “cut to fit fifteen-minute radio shows, then cut again to fill a two-minute book column, winding up at last as a ten-or twelve-line dictionary resume.”
At the same time, the advancements of technology made firemen redundant: all buildings were now built of fireproof materials, so firemen could now start, rather than put out fires.
In other words, the government tasked them with destroying books for society’s sake, especially “the slippery stuff” like literature, philosophy, sociology, you know, things which ask “why” instead of “how.”
Beatty leaves the house of the Montags with a threat, and the first part ends with Guy forcing Millie to read with him so that the two can see if books have values or not.
The Sieve and the Sand
The second part begins where the first one ends: with Montag and Millie discussing books stolen by Guy during his book-burning missions.
However, unlike Guy who is curious, Millie is completely uninterested in discussions such as these, questioning the very reason why should anyone ever care about books.
In a rant, Guy gives her quite a few: the world is empty and shallow, an old woman decided that it is not worth living without books, and, let us not forget, she has recently survived a suicide attempt.
Perhaps, Guy thinks, perhaps these old books have some answers which can soothe us, and even pacify the threat of war which is both constant and ignored by just about everybody.
The conversation between Guy and Millie is interrupted by a call: it’s 
, a friend of Millie, who wants to set up a date with her and their other friend, 
, to watch the “parlor walls” that night at the house of the Montags.
Guy realizes that there’s nothing he can do to arouse Millie’s interest, so he tries to remember someone who could help him with his new-discovered dilemmas and thoughts.
And, suddenly, he has a revelation: 
, an English professor from the time before books were banned, whom Guy has met once previously in a park.
If he can’t help me, he thinks, nobody can.
So Guy takes an old and rare copy of the 
 with himself and heads to Faber’s house.
Of course, Faber is not that interested into talking with a fireman, but Guy has his way with him in the end: he forces Faber to start speaking after threatening to rip every single page of the 
if he doesn’t.
However, during the discussion, Faber realizes that Montag is changed and he gives him an ear-piece communicator through which he promises to guide him on his journey.
Back at his house, Guy Montag finds Millie with her friends immersed in their “parlor wall” shows. 
Frustrated and angry with their ignorance and indifference to the real world around them, Montag turns off the walls and tries starting a discussion with the three women on important and meaningful matters.
The discussion goes nowhere and the enraged and, thus, careless Montag (to the dismay of Mr. Faber who overhears everything through the earpiece) storms into his room and comes back with a book of poetry in his hands.
Guy starts reciting Matthew Arnold’s “Dover Beach” to the women, and Mrs. Phelps starts to cry.
Millie tries to dismiss everything describing it as a firemen’s tradition, but her friends eventually leave in disgust, despite the fact that (at the behest of the voice of Faber), Guy burns the poetry book.
Aware of the fact that Captain Beatty knows more than he tells him – and suspicious that he has already seen a book at his place – Guy takes the stolen Bible and heads to the firehouse where Beatty is playing cards with other firemen.
As the book is thrown into the trash, Beatty reveals to Guy that he had dreamt him engaging in a quoting-war with him; apparently, the disillusioned antagonist Captain Beatty did read books in his time – and enjoyed them.
Suddenly, a fire alarm sounds.
Beatty hears through the dispatcher: the location of the fire is Montag’s house.
Burning Bright
After revealing to Guy that his wife and her friends had reported the events of the previous night to the government, Beatty orders Montag to destroy his own house.
Montag, seeing no way out, obliges, abolishing his house with a flamethrower provided by Beatty.
Millie goes mad: not because of what’s happening to her actual husband or her house, but because of the fact that she’s losing her “parlor wall” family, i.e., the characters in the TV shows she enjoys watching.
While all of this is happening, Beatty notices the ear-piece in Montag’s ears and reveals to him that he plans to hunt down Faber. Montag threatens his Captain with the flamethrower and, after Beatty smilingly asks Guy to hand his weapon over, burns his boss alive:
Afterward, Montag flees the scene; but not before he has an encounter with the Mechanical Hound, “an eight-legged glass and metal contraption that serves as a surveillance tool and programmable killing machine for the firemen, who use it to track down suspected book hoarders and readers.”
Fortunately, Montag manages to destroy the Mechanical Hound and somehow reaches the house of Faber.
The old man tells him to proceed to the countryside where he should find a bunch of exiled book-lovers. (Now there’s a phrase which sounds strange no matter how many times we read it out loud.)
Montag manages to escape another Mechanical Hound and a nationwide manhunt by swimming through a river; he comes ashore in the countryside, where he eventually happens upon the book-lovers.
There, a man named 
shows Guy the ongoing manhunt on a portable TV and tells him that he will be caught in a few minutes.
And he is!
Well, sort of.
It’s actually 
 Montag, aka, an innocent man caught and killed by the government forces so as to cover up Guy’s escape and demonstrate to the rest of the population what happens to traitors.
Fahrenheit 451 Epilogue
Guy learns that the exiled book-lovers are all former intellectuals and that each of them has memorized at least a few books in an attempt to contribute to the rebuilding of society if such a day comes when this one is annihilated by the imminent nuclear war.
Coincidentally, the war happens that very night: bombers fly over the heads of the drifters and shatter the city into smithereens; it’s a devastating one-day nuclear war, and the people in the countryside are practically the only ones who survive.
While looking at a fire, Granger turns to his friends and tells them a story:
After having a meal, the exiles head to the city, in an attempt to rebuild society a new with their knowledge.

The American Dream is alive and well; unfortunately, not for everyone.
And the upper middle class is to blame for that. Because, as far as Richard V. Reeves is concerned, they are 
.
Read ahead to find out what he means by that.
Who Should Read “Dream Hoarders”? And Why?
is for everyone who thinks that the American Dream is dead and interested in finding the reasons which have contributed to this result; it’s, even more, a book for those who think the opposite.
But, above all, it’s a book about the upper middle class, the top 20% of America’s population which holds about 90% of the total American wealth; and which is raging against the top 1% while being reviled by the bottom 40%.
Yup, we’re talking about 
. You are the problem. And you should read this book to find out why and what you should do about it.

 “Dream Hoarders PDF Summary”
, the American Dream is not dead – but only for about half of the American population blessed with the privilege of growing up in its more prosperous countries where vertical mobility is still a possibility.
Richard V. Reeves
thinks he knows what’s the real problem: the upper middle class. And in 
– a book which grew out of his widely circulated 
article “
” – he explains why and how we should deal with it.
1    Hoarding the Dream
America lives in a pretty strange reality: 
 and looks as if he’s just gotten out of a cartoon; even stranger, he is a multibillionaire supported by blue-collar workers!
“At first glance,” writes Richard V. Reeves, “Trump’s success among middle-class whites might seem surprising, given his own wealth. But his movement was about class, not money. Trump exuded and validated blue-collar culture and was loved for it.”
Why, you ask?
, it is because – to the dismay of Liberal Democrats and Socialists – Trump’s supporters, as poor as they may be, have no problem with the fabulously rich. 
On the contrary, in fact: they admire them excessively because they’ve become what they are 
 the fact that they look like cartoon characters; they see the ultra-rich as the embodiment of their most intimate dreams.
“The enemy,” writes Reeves, “is the upper-middle-class professionals: journalists, scholars, technocrats, managers, bureaucrats, the people with letters after their names. You and me.”
“And here is the difficult part,” he goes on:
2    A Class Apart
The criticism against the top 1% of the population is so commonplace nowadays that there’s really no reason to go over the main points yet again.
But you know why is that?
Because it both comes from the direction – and communicates with – 
: the 19% just below that top 1% of the population, i.e., the upper middle class, aka a large mass of people who are actually doing pretty well in life. 
No wonder why the majority of the bottom 40% (the 
 40%!) are not convinced!
Here’s a great example: according to Adam Levine, “more than a third of the demonstrators on the May Day ‘Occupy’ march in 2011 had annual earnings of more than $100,000.”
Now, don’t get Reeves wrong: he’s all about taxing the ultra-rich and limiting their potential to amass fabulous amounts of wealth at the expense of the poorest.
But, he’s also for extending the definition of what it means to be rich.
Because, according to stats, the upper middle class not only earns a lot more than the 80% of people below it, but it is also the one who reaps the benefits of progress:
Of course, more money means more freedom, better education and far better health: the top 20% smoke less, exercise more and live much longer than the rest of the population.
No wonder the rest feel like 
.
3    Growing Gains
To say the least, “for those of us in the American upper middle class, life is pretty good.”
We enjoy the advantages well beyond our bank balances: “skills and education; control over our working life; the quality of our neighborhoods; ability to plan confidently for the future; our health, diet, and life spans; the stability of our families; and so on.”
However, there’s one privilege we enjoy that quite possibly tops each of the above because it is “the one most dangerous to the American ideal of equal opportunity.”
Namely, how we raise our kids. 
“In the modern economy,” writes Reeves, “human capital has become vital for success. The most educated and affluent parents got the memo. Upper-middle-class families have become greenhouses for the cultivation of human capital. Children raised in them are on a different track than ordinary Americans, right from the very beginning.”
In other words, a typical child born and raised in the American upper middle class is privileged to live, on average, in a stable home and to be raised by married and well-educated parents.
In addition, this child is fortunate enough to live in a great neighborhood, which, 
, may contribute to about half of his skills and IQ.
Even more: this child is able to go to that area’s best schools which are far better than the schools located in bad neighborhoods; as a result, this child should eventually develop “a wide range of skills and gain an impressive array of credentials.”
4    Inheriting Class
OK, the upper middle class is privileged, you say, but that may be the bottom 80%’s fault. 
After all, they live in the land of the free and the home of the brave; if he/she wants, anyone can move upward the social ladder in the US!
That’s not true, but let’s just say it is; contrary to many articles and studies, let’s just say that the US is egalitarian when it comes to opportunities, and that vertical mobility is a thing for just about every single citizen of the US.
The problem?
Even if that is the case, those who are up almost never come down. “Rather than a poverty trap,” writes Gary Solon, “there seems to be more stickiness at the other end: a ‘wealth trap’ if you will.”
In other words, there are many Horatio-Alger-like rags to riches stories floating around; but, how many riches-to-rags stories do you know?
The graphic below shows that the answer is probably “not that many”:
Now, why is this important?
Because “it is a stubborn mathematical fact that, at any given time, the top fifth of the income distribution can accommodate only 20 percent of the population. Relative intergenerational mobility is necessarily a zero-sum game. For one person to move up the ladder, somebody else must move down.”
The problem, in other words, is not just class separation, but class perpetuation. And the solution is the wildly unpopular idea of downward mobility.
Say what you will, but that may be the very reason why you’re rich now.
.
5    Market Merit
“America,” writes Reeves in the very first sentence of this chapter, “has a meritocratic market but an unfair society.”
In other words, the market works the way it should work, rewarding those who are better skilled and have competitive advantages over the rest.
The problem is – as the previous two chapters have already implied – that some have competitive advantages from the very outset.
That’s why the main challenge that lies before America is narrowing the gaps in human capital formation in the first two decades of life.
Put quite simply, an upper-middle-class child is bound to have better education and more capital to start with – not to mention facing less judgment and discrimination – when the actual market race starts.
So, we have meritocracy with no mobility which means that the market rewards fairly the ones who have an unfair advantage.
“The playing field may be level,” sums up the argument Chris Haynes in 
,
“but certain kids get to spend nights and weekends practicing in advance of the competition… the pyramid of merit has come to mirror the pyramid of wealth and cultural capital.”
Want to put an end to that?
Read ahead! 
6    Opportunity Hoarding
The upper-middle-class children are not ahead when the market race starts merely because of their unfair advantages gained through inheritance; they are also ahead because their parents have hoarded opportunities, practically stealing them from the rest.
Three opportunity hoarding mechanisms stand out in particular:
• exclusionary zoning in residential areas; 
• unfair mechanisms influencing college admissions, including legacy preferences;
• the informal allocation of internships.
In other words, the game is rigged in favor of the ones who are in a position to rig it:
7    Sharing the Dream
“I don’t intend to set out a comprehensive, detailed manifesto,” writes Reeves in the introduction to the seventh chapter of 
. “Instead, I propose seven steps that we can and should take.”
Here they are:
#1. Reduce unintended pregnancies through better contraception;
#2. Increase home visiting to improve parenting;
#3. Get better teachers for unlucky kids;
#4. Fund college fairly;
#5. Curb exclusionary zoning;
#6. End legacy admissions;
#7. Open up internships.
As you can see, the objective of the first four of these seven steps is to make the preparation for the market contest more even; the goal of the other three is to reduce anticompetitive behaviors.
The aim of all of them: to make life a little bit fairer.
8    Check Our Privilege
In the final, concluding chapter of 
, Reeves explains that the reason why he got his American passport was fairly simple: “the nation’s spirit of openness and promise of social equality.”
“I always hated the snobbery and class distinctions of the United Kingdom,” he goes on. “But the harder I have looked at my new homeland, the more convinced I have become that the American class system is hardening, especially at the top. It has, if anything, become more rigid than in the United Kingdom. The main difference now is that Americans refuse to admit it.”
It’s time that we do.
Highlight on the “we” if you’re an upper-middle-class kid. 
Key Lessons from “Dream Hoarders”
1.      America Has Become a Class-Based Society
2.      The Upper Middle-Class Rigs the Market and Hoards Opportunities
3.      Seven Ways to Share the American Dream – If You Earn More than $100,000 a Year
America Has Become a Class-Based Society
America has always prided itself in the fact that it is a free society of individuals. To be American, writes Reeves, is “to be free to make something of yourself.”
However, in modern societies freedom is very tightly linked with money; and about 50% of American money is hoarded by the wealthiest 1% of the population.
It gets even worse: 90% of the total wealth is held by one-fifth of Americans.
Reeves’ book is directed at the 19% who refuse to admit that they are rich and privileged – and, that way, make life unbearable for the 80% that remains. 
The Upper Middle-Class Rigs the Market and Hoards Opportunities
So, in a way, America has become exactly what Marxists have always blamed it on being: a class-based society.
However, as Trump’s victory at the 2016 election demonstrated, “the real class divide is not between the upper class and the upper middle class: it is between the upper middle class and everyone else.”
Why?
Because the upper-middle-class children live healthier and longer, and in better families and affluent neighborhoods, and are privileged to go to better and more success-prone schools.
What’s worse, their parents – say, through exclusionary zoning in residential areas and legacy college admissions – make a place there only for other parents such as them, thereby hoarding opportunities from the rest.
Seven Ways to Share the American Dream – If You Earn More than $100,000 a Year
If you are a member of the upper-middle-class and you’re reading this, then Reeves’ letter is for you:
And there are seven ways we can do this:
#1. Reduce unintended pregnancies through better contraception;
#2. Increase home visiting to improve parenting;
#3. Get better teachers for unlucky kids;
#4. Fund college fairly;
#5. Curb exclusionary zoning;

Anyway, Sarah Young, the daughter of a college professor, was living and studying at a Christian community in a tiny Alpine village in France at the time and, to use her words, “was free to explore the fairyland-like environment all around” her.
And so she did.
Every day she would climb a steep heel to attain a panoramic view of “unbroken beauty,” which included everything from a high-steepled church through the sun-bathed Lake Geneva to the icy tips of the Alps.
And then, one night:
To tell you the truth, if we ever get the chance to experience something similar, we might just as well feel what Sarah Young felt.
But the story doesn’t end there.
Intimations of God #2: “An Overwhelming Presence”
The following year, Sarah Young went back to the United States to work as a technical writer in Virginia.
One day, her boss sent her to Atlanta to attend a relevant conference; Young accepted the assignment, but she did so without any enthusiasm or wish to go through with it.
You see, at the time, she was “grieving the loss of a serious dating relationship,” and, as you (unfortunately) know full well, it’s not like you’re interested in anything (let alone conferences) at times such as these.
In fact, in Young’s words, it was the other way around: she was even starting to wonder whether there’s any point in being a Christian or, even more, a believer.
Incapable of overcoming the solitude and the darkness of her hotel room, Young began aimlessly walking the streets of Atlanta and came across a bookshop.
She was suddenly drawn to a specific book: 
by Catherine Marshall.
Naturally, she bought it and spent the whole night reading it.
“I no longer felt alone,” she writes. “I knelt beside the bed in that sterile room and felt an overwhelming Presence of peace and love come over me. I knew Jesus was with me and that He sympathized with my heartache. This was unquestionably the same ‘Sweet Jesus’ I had met in the Alps.”
Presence-Less Sixteen Years
“During the next sixteen years,” Young goes on, “I lived what many people might consider an exemplary Christian life.”
What does this mean?
Well, first of all, earning a master’s degree in counseling and biblical studies from the Covenant Theological Seminary in St. Louis.
There Young met her husband, Steve, a third-generation missionary to Japan. 
After graduation, she joined him and spent the next eight years in Japan, doing church-planting work; in the meantime, the couple had two children: a girl and a boy.
After Japan, Steve and Sarah returned to the U.S. where they spent the next three years. While Steve was working at a local Japanese church, Sarah earned a further degree in counseling at Georgia State University.
As part of her training, she worked at a Christian counseling center in the Atlanta area. 
And everything seemed perfect: Sarah had a loving husband, two delightful children, a chance to help “deeply wounded women find healing in Christ.”
“However,” she concludes, “not once during those sixteen years did I vividly experience the Presence of Jesus.”
The Beginning of a New Quest
In the summer of 1990, Sarah Young began reading a devotional book
 by Andrew Murray. 
The book helped her persist through “a very unstructured time” in her life, during which Sarah underwent four surgeries (two for melanoma), had to quit her job and had to incessantly wait with her husband for approval for their Australian visas.
“In the midst of those momentous changes,” she writes, “I began seeking God’s Presence in earnest. My days started alone with God, equipped with Bible, devotional book, prayer journal, pen, and coffee. As I waited in His Presence, God began to reveal Himself to me. An hour or two alone with Him seemed too brief.”
Finally, the visas arrived, and Steve and Sarah went to Australia, where Sarah was supposed to counsel hurt and abused Australian women and introduce them to the ways of Christ.
The pain to hear these stories was almost unbearable, so Sarah prayed for protection each and every day.
One morning, as she prayed, she visualized God protecting her and her family, encircling them with His Protective Presence which materialized in the form of golden light and the feeling of profound peace. “I lost all sense of time as I experienced God’s Presence in this powerful way,” says Sarah. “I had not sought the experience, but I received it gratefully and was strengthened by it.”
There was, of course, a reason for this event: just three days later, Sarah had to counsel a client, an incest survivor, who had been abused in several Satanic rituals.
She was able to endure it all: she knew that God’s light was above her.
First Message from God
In 1992, Sarah Young began to read a book which directly influenced this one.
Titled 
, this was a devotional book written by two anonymous “listeners” – women who decided to record the messages they had received from God. 
In the book, the messages are written in the first person, as in every single “I” in 
 designates God. 
Now, back to the quotation marks around the word “listeners” above.
We wonder: if these two anonymous women were actually able to listen to God’s messages, aren’t they listeners 
 the quotation marks? Moreover, if they weren’t, aren’t they frauds?
Sarah didn’t ask herself these questions; and, in a way, that implies that she believes the former. So, God apparently didn’t just shut up when He finished dictating the Bible.
And this is where things get really strange!
In 1993, Sarah Young began to wonder if she could, too, receive messages during her times of communing with God. 
“I had been writing in prayer journals for years,” she informs us, “but that was one-way communication: I did all the talking. I knew that God communicated with me through the Bible, but I yearned for more. Increasingly, I wanted to hear what God had to say to me personally on a given day.”
So, Sarah decided to listen to God with pen in hand, writing down whatever she “believed He was saying.”
And, voilà: “I received a message,” Sarah says without even realizing what that actually means. “It was short, biblical, and appropriate. It addressed topics that were current in my life: trust, fear, and closeness to God. I responded by writing in my prayer journal.”
Now, you’ll have to agree: that’s a pretty mundane thing to do after being visited by God Himself.
Messages from God – 366 of Them (At Least)
“My journaling had changed from monologue to dialogue,” goes on Young. 
“Soon, messages began to flow more freely, and I bought a special notebook to record these words. This new way of communicating with God became the high point of my day. I knew these writings were not inspired as Scripture is, but they were helping me grow closer to God.”
A quick analysis of that paragraph:
• Apparently, if you need to record God’s words, you better use a special notebook for that (otherwise, He’d be really angry!);
• Communicating with God was the high point of Sarah Young’s days (as opposed to buying the last bar of Snickers at a vending machine, we guess? Why would anyone need to point that out 
?);
• God’s words are sometimes not as inspired as other times (apparently, God’s Muses are on strike since the days of yore – or, at least, not as inspired in English).
Jokes aside, one gets the feeling that Sarah doesn’t realize what she’s actually saying because she explicitly states that she “continued to receive personal messages from God.”
And that:
The 
 Devotional
Now that you know how 
came to be, it’s time that we told you a bit about its actual content,
As we said above, just like 
, this book is a daily devotional, which means that it consists of 366 messages, one for each day of the year, apparently each of them coming directly from God via Young. 
Young also includes Scripture references after each daily reading, because, as she says, as she listened to God, “Bible verses or fragments of verses often came to mind.”
She uses some of them as epigraphs for each of the months.
If you are interested, these are the verses
• 
: “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” (Jeremiah 29:11)
• 
: “Look to the LORD and his strength; seek his face always.” (Psalm 105:4)
• 
: “When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.” (
 10:4)
• 
: “In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.” (Proverbs 3:6)
• 
: “Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; worship the LORD in the splendor of his holiness.” (Psalm 29:2)
• 
: “For I am the LORD, your God, who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, Do not fear; I will help you.” (Isaiah 41:13)
• 
: “Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.” (Romans 8:1)
• 
: “Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him.” (John 7: 38)
• 
: “. . . I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” (John 8:12)
• 
: “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” (Matthew 11:28)
• 
: “And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 4:19)
• 
: “For to us a child is born… And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.” (Isaiah 9:6)
Just so that you can get the feeling of Sarah’s (or God’s) style, we’ve chosen for you an example message, the daily devotional for February 21
, the date when 
.
Here it is, in its entirety:
The message is followed by three verses taken from the Bible: Colossians 2:6-7; Psalm 141:8; and 1 Peter 5:7.
Apparently, even God needs footnotes.

3.      Daily Messages from God
Sarah Young Found God in Times of Distress
As Sarah Young writes in the introduction to 
, she experienced God’s Presence only in times of distress; for some reason, when things were going well, Jesus didn’t appear to her.
That’s why she has written this book: so that you can grow your love to God even when it seems that He has forgotten you.
The Bible Is Inerrant – But Is It Enough?
“The Bible is, of course, the only inerrant Word of God,” writes Sarah Young in 
And yet, it seems that it wasn’t sufficient since she had to find a more personal way to communicate with God.
She even says this explicitly:
“I knew that God communicated with me through the Bible, but I yearned for more.”
And she got more: daily messages from God Himself.
“I knew these writings were not inspired as Scripture is,” Young says, “but they were helping me grow closer to God.”
So, apparently, 
is both more than the Bible and less than it at the same time.
Just sayin’.
Daily Messages from God
The messages from 
“are meant to be read slowly, preferably in a quiet place,” writes Young.
“Themes of thankfulness and trust recurred often during my listening times,” she goes on. “These themes are quite prevalent in the Bible, and they are essential if we are to enjoy Jesus’ Presence and Peace.”
Consequently, most of the devotionals are written in such a manner; and they’ll probably help you if you suspense your (dis)belief for some time.
And realize that humans sometimes can help other humans in profound ways.

Our Critical Review
To tell you the truth, we don’t know what to tell you about 
.
The book is not merely #1 Best Seller in the Inspiration & Spirituality category at Amazon – it’s also one of the very few books which can boast an almost perfect 5-star rating with over 17,000 reviews.
It’s an understatement to say that it is an accomplishment when 92% of your many, many reviewers consider your book all but perfect.
And yet – as far as we are concerned – this book is nothing short of blatantly blasphemous if you are a believer or downright miraculous if you are a scientist.
, “I don’t think Young is proposing to add the book of Young after Revelation. But that is, in effect, what her writings are claiming.”
In other words, if Young has actually heard God, then scientists should be doing studies on her; if she hasn’t, then she’s lying (so unchristian).
As always, we are skeptics, so, 17,000 reviewers aside, we really don’t think that you should bother with this book; even if you are a believer."

reveals how free market capitalism has merely reinforced inequality in 21

Who Should Read “Ground Down by Growth”? And Why?
If you’re interested in 
 or have enjoyed books such as 
, then this is one fine addition to your reading list, since it analyzes the lives of those which history usually forgets: the Dalits and the Adivasi.
Also, if you want to know more about how modern economic policies have affected the marginalized groups in India and to what extent free market capitalism has managed to eradicate poverty and inequality – here are quite a few case studies that will definitely interest you.
Since they all come to the conclusion that the liberalization of the markets and the trickle-down effect hasn’t helped not one bit the underprivileged of India, 
is undoubtedly a book which socialists and communists would love to have around to make their points.

“Ground Down by Growth PDF Summary”
– to quote a great review by Rashné Limki from the University of Edinburgh – “is the story of India’s perennial and illusionary promise of 
 (good days).”
Incidentally, these 
 were a mainstay in current Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s election campaign in the lead-up to the 2014 parliamentary elections.
Five years later, he’s still in power, the slogan 
(“good days are coming”) has become a 
 across the nation, but, as the authors of 
show throughout their studies, the good days will probably never come for about 300 million people.
Yup, we’re talking about the Dalit and Adivasi communities, aka the backward castes, the Untouchables.
“Preface” – Alpa Shah and Jens Lerche
In the book’s 
(which you can read in full 
), Alpa Shah and Jens Lerche discuss the connection between tribe, caste, class, and inequality in modern India.
First, they give an overview of the literature on the subject and the opposing opinions, and then they move on to see what the data says that the “absolute commitment to the free market and state-sponsored privatization” has amounted to after three decades.
The conclusions?
There are two Indias: one which ranks fourth on the list of dollar billionaires, and another which is the “India of dislocation and despair”:
In other words, though India’s economic growth is widely celebrated, the on-terrain results reveal a different reality.
“Some advances have been made in reduction of absolute levels of poverty,” write Shah and Lerche. “But – although people are slightly better off – they are less equal than before. Income and wealth inequality is increasing in the India that is being celebrated for its growth rates.”
 focuses on the marginalized communities of India and explores how they are treated – and how their conditions have worsened with the advent of capitalism – region by region.
1. “Tribe, Caste and Class – New Mechanisms of Exploitation and Oppression” – Alpa Shah and Jens Lerche
As stated in the “Preface,” 
 “asks how and why, despite India’s celebrated economic growth, the marginalization of low castes and tribes persists in the country.”
And the first article – once again authored by Shah and Lerche, explores theoretically “the inextricability of identity-based oppression – of caste and tribe in particular, but also region and gender – and class relations in the belly of the Indian boom.”
“Tribe, Caste and Class – New Mechanisms of Exploitation and Oppression” offers a theoretical framework for the studies which follow by renouncing the fashionable “intersectionality” approach to investigate poverty, discrimination, and oppression.
Instead, the authors go back to Marx and Gramsci and frame the rest of the studies along these three axes of analysis:
• inherited inequalities of power;
• super-exploitation of migrant workers; and
• conjugated oppression.
2. “Macro-Economic Aspects of Inequality and Poverty in India” – K.P. Kannan
In a nutshell, K.P. Kannan’s essay demonstrates something that should be obvious to anyone but the hardcore capitalists: the trickle-down effect may work for the higher castes, but the lower your position on the caste pyramid, the less sense it makes to believe that free markets will make any difference in your life.
Drawing on Kannan’s work on the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector, the essay offers a statistical framework which proves, once again, that 
economy – or free market fundamentalism as some would say – rather than obliterating inequality 
 it.
And before you start screaming from the top of your lungs “hey, you, communists, you, but that’s 
, after all,” please take a minute or two to digest this fact: 92% of Indian workers do not have secure forms of employment!
Why?
Because owners, hungry for docile workforce, try their best to keep the status quo, ensnaring the poorest in linguistically isolated communists and denying them access to welfare government schemes anyway they can.
That’s the capitalist miracle of India for you, right there! 
3. “Tea Belts of the Western Ghats, Kerala” – Jayaseelan Raj
Jayaseelan Raj’s essay analyses the working conditions in the tea belts of Kerala, where for decades the main workforce consists of Tamil Dalits, “descendants of indentured workers initially transferred by the British to work on tea plantations.”
However, their condition hasn’t improved but deteriorated after India 
, because contemporary plantation owners have used the chaotic transition toward free-market capitalism to prevent the Tamil Dalits from accessing any personal land, including, say, kitchen gardens cultivated by them for their personal use.
This “inculcates a sense of psychological alienation in which workers control nothing in the plantation” – not even their own lives.
So why don’t they unionize, you ask?
Well, they’ve tried, but to no avail!
Because Adivasis are living in even worse conditions and every attempt at unionization is thwarted by threats that the Tamil Dalits will lose their jobs to Adivasi workers from Jharkhand.
Back at the time of the 
, the Dalits and the Adivasis could be used as a hypercorrect definition 
 more than a century later, it seems that nothing’s changed. 
4. “Cuddalore, Chemical Industrial Estate, Tamil Nadu” – Brendan Donegan
Brendan Donegan’s essay, “Cuddalore, Chemical Industrial Estate, Tamil Nadu” analyzes how the shift from an agrarian to industrial economy has merely reconfigured the ever-existent caste-based dependencies – and nothing more.
Industrialization, shows Donegan, hasn’t resulted in an outward migration of people but has merely caused in-migration of industry.
In other words, it’s not that new factories are built in more progressive Indian cities allowing Dalits and Adivasis to break free from their untouchable status by moving somewhere else; it’s that former plantation owners have now built factories in the vicinity of the plantations.
Vanniyars and Gounders were the upper-caste landlords before the industrialization, and they are now factory owners and labor contractors; the Paraiyar (Dalits), the Irula (Adivasis), and the Nattar (fishers) were the underprivileged lower-caste workers in the agricultural past – and they still are.
Once again, their unionization is held in check by migrant contract workers (from Odisha and Bengal), and, once again, they are pressured into obedience through many hardly legal measures.
Here’s an example analyzed and commented upon by Donegan.
A Dalit breaks away from his lower-caste shackles and becomes a labor contractor; in time, he succeeds to agree 6 contracts with the local bone factory.
Before he even starts proving his worth, he loses 5 of these 6 contracts due to upper-caste political pressure.
The non-Dalit contractors do everything in their power (and even outside it) to stop a fledgling Dalit contractor from moving upward on the pyramid.
One more thing.
The only contract he’s allowed to keep involves “cleaning bones and packaging waste material.” In other words, what an Untouchable – be he a contractor or not – should do.
5. “Bhadrachalam Scheduled Area, Telangana” – Dalel Benbabaali
Many authors claim that education is the first step toward vertical mobility and equality; tell that to India.
In Dalel Benbabaali’s essay about the Bhadrachalam Scheduled Area in Telangana, we learn how the Koyas (Adivasi) and the Madigas (Dalit) are kept in check by the local upper echelons (the former Kamma agricultural castes) which deny them the right to education.
In an analyzed example, a local Kamma landlord continually obstructs the efforts of local school teachers to educate the children of the Koyas and the Madigas above grade 7.
The reason?
He was never educated beyond that! 
Benbabaali demonstrates once again the dark side of free market fundamentalism: many government regulations (even constitutional provisions are not an exception!) are overturned daily in the name of industrial capitalism.
6. “Chamba Valley, Himalaya, Himachal Pradesh” – Richard Axelby
Richard Axelby’s article in 
deals with the Chamba Valley in Himachal Pradesh and two 
 (aka Untouchables): the Gaddi and the Gujjar (Muslim).
Now, if Dalel Benbabaali shows how upper castes exert control over scheduled tribes by denying them the right education, Richard Axelby demonstrates how even that is not necessary anymore since the tribes themselves do not believe in the emancipatory potential of education.
Why?
Because regardless of education, many Dalits and Adivasis are simply denied proper SC/ST (scheduled caste/scheduled tribe) status.
Without these documents, they are by definition not allowed to employment reservations, which means that all of those years they’ve spent learning are for, well, naught.
Axelby examines how the switch from pastoralism to agriculture has affected the Dalits and the Adivasis and how nomadism and seasonal migrations have resulted in many Dalits and Adivasis losing SC/T status in native jurisdictions.
In other words, even the government doesn’t help; in fact, quite on the contrary.
7. “Narmada Valley and Adjoining Plains, Maharashtra” – Vikramaditya Thakur
In Vikramaditya Thakur’s article of the conditions in the Narmada Valley and the adjoining plains in Maharashtra, we learn of the fate of the Bhils (or Bheels), the largest tribe group in India.
Thakur examines all the difficulties the Bhils have faced (and are bound to face) regardless of whether they have stayed in their traditional villages, migrated to towns for work or have been resettled via the 
.
Strangely enough, the results of each choice amount to pretty the same: in villages or towns, by dams or in factories, the Bhils end up being oppressed by dominant castes (say, the Gujars of Gujarat).
Simply put, if you’re Bhil, you don’t stand a chance – no matter what you do!
8. “The Struggles Ahead” – Alpa Shah and Jens Lerche 
The last chapter of 
functions as a sort of a conclusion to the book.
In it, Alpa Shah and Jens Lerche list the findings presented in the articles summarized above and describe the problems that lie ahead.
Unfortunately, the latter are as many as you’d expect.
And it seems that the authors are not feeling that optimistic as to whether any current politician is interested in understanding them and finding ways to overcome them.

1.      There Are Two Indias
2.      Free Market Capitalism Hasn’t Solved India’s Problems: It Has Worsened Them
3.      The Marginalized Will Always Be Marginalized… Unless the Government Does Something About It
There Are Two Indias
Only the US, China, and Germany have more billionaires than India, something practically unimaginable until just about a few decades ago, i.e., before the liberalization of markets and the introduction of more 
 capitalism.
However, at the same time, there’s another India, one “of dislocation and despair,” in which the poor of the past are now only absolutely wealthier, but relatively both more destitute and unhappier.
Free Market Capitalism Hasn’t Solved India’s Problems: It Has Worsened Them
Many proponents of free-market capitalism claim that the “trickle down” effect should, in time, solve problems such as poverty and inequality to a pretty satisfactory margin.
However, as far as India is concerned, this “trickle down” effect is a “slow drip” and, as a few studies show it is exactly this mechanism which entrenches inequality, rather than obliterating it.
And since the rich 
getting richer by huge margins and the poor by minimal, actually India’s poor of the past are all the poorer now.
In fact, 
.
The Marginalized Will Always Be Marginalized… Unless the Government Does Something About It
Reading through the articles in 
, one gets the feeling that the marginalized groups of India just can’t catch a break.
No matter what they do, no matter how much they try, they are simply incapable of moving a few steps upward the caste pyramid – due to higher-caste obstructions and corruption.
In a way, it seems that unless the government does something about these groups and their rights, they will always be the exploited ones.

Plot
 is neither a novel nor an original work: it is a series of interconnected Norse myths, somewhat reimagined by Neil Gaiman and retold in his well-liked style. 
In other words, you can read much more about each of the myths retold in this book on, say, Wikipedia; however, you’d be missing all the fun and the pretty unforgettable Neil Gaiman flavor.
Here’s a great example on how effortlessly Gaiman combines dark imagery with humor, taken from the chapter titled “Freya’s Unusual Wedding;” you don’t need to know the characters to enjoy it, but if you want to meet them, see below: 
An Introduction
In the “Introduction” to 
, Neil Gaiman explains three things:
• The cultural and literary significance of Norse mythology;
• The difference between the traditional representations of these gods and heroes and the way they have been reimagined in popular culture; and
• The sources he used and how he used them to retell these myths and stories as accurately as he could, and as interestingly as possible. (Mostly these include many different translations of Snorri Sturluson’s 
, the verses of 
and 
 by Rudolf Simek).
In the “Introduction,” Gaiman also explains how he fell in love with Norse mythology, and how he was fascinated to learn as a child (mostly via reading and rereading 
 by Roger Lancelyn Green) that, unlike any other gods, the Norse gods came with their own doomsday.
Yup, you’ve heard that right: according to all prophecies, the Norse gods are destined to face the frost giants in a battle to end all battles called Ragnarök (or the Twilight of the Gods), and they (
 of them) are supposed to die:
“The Norse myths are the myths of a chilly place,” concludes Gaiman, “with long, long winter nights and endless summer days, myths of a people who did not entirely trust or even like their gods, although they respected and feared them.”
And these are some of them.
The Players
“Many gods and goddesses are named in Norse mythology,” informs us Gaiman at the beginning of his book. “Most of the stories we have, however, concern two gods, Odin and his son Thor, and Odin’s blood brother, a giant’s son called Loki, who lives with the Aesir in Asgard.”
Suitably, the first chapter introduces us these three characters, the main figures in Norse mythology:
• 
, the highest and the oldest of all gods; “he wears a cloak and a hat and only has one eye, having traded the other for wisdom. He has many other names including all-father, Grimnir, and the gallows god.” 
• 
, red-bearded, Thor is Odin’s son and the strongest of all gods; he is the Aesir god of thunder and is “straightforward where his father Odin is cunning, good-natured where his father is devious;” Thor’s weapon is called Mjollnir and is a remarkable hammer forged for him by dwarfs.
• 
, the most complicated character in all of Norse mythology; “very handsome[…] plausible, convincing, likable, and far and away the most wily, subtle, and shrewd of all the inhabitants of Asgard,” Loki “makes the world more interesting but less safe. He is the father of monsters, the author of woes, the sly god.”
Before the Beginning, and After
At the beginning of everything, there was nothing but the Niflheim, the mist world, formless and shapeless, and Muspell, the fire world, always burning.
Between these two worlds, there was nothingness and a “yawning gap” called Ginnungagap; it was here that the first creature was born, neither male nor female, bigger than all gods and giants there have been or ever will be: Ymir.
In addition to Ymir, from the ice there sprang another creature: Audhumla, a harmless cow whose milk nourished Ymir for eons.
One day, in his sleep, Ymir gave birth to three giants, one female; and another Audhumla licked a man from a block of ice: Buri.
Now, this Buri married Ymir’s daughter, and these two had a son named Bor; Bor married Bestla (daughter of Ymir’s son), and these had three sons: Odin, Vili, and Ve.
In an attempt to create something out of the nothing, Odin and his brothers killed Ymir and from his body and brains and blood created all the nine worlds.
The gods and the giants are enemies ever since the murder of Ymir.
Yggdrasil and the Nine Worlds
Yggdrasil is the name of a mighty ash tree, the most perfect of all trees in the world; it is the tree which connects all the nine worlds created by Odin and his brothers.
The second chapter lists all of them:
• 
, the home of the Aesir, where Odin, Thor, and Loki (and all the others live);
• 
, the realm of the light elves, “as beautiful as the sun or the stars;”
• 
 (or 
), the home of the dwarfs (aka, the dark elves) located beneath the mountains;
• 
, the world of humans, our world; 
• 
, the world of the frost and the mountain giants;
• 
, the home of the Vanir, another race of gods; after a brutal war, now the Aesir and the Vanir live in peace and often visit each other in their respective worlds;
• 
, the dark mist world;
• 
, the world of flame; and
• 
, well, basically, 
.
Mimir’s Head and Odin’s Eye
This is a brief chapter retelling the story of how Odin got his wisdom from his uncle 
, the keeper of the spring of wisdom in Jotunheim.
It’s Norse mythology, so it’s both unpleasant and heroic: Mimir asked for Odin’s eye and Odin plucked it out. 
After Mimir is killed by the Vanir, Odin took his head and still keeps it near the spring and asks it for advices.
The Treasures of the Gods
Many of the stories begin with some mischief by Loki; this one’s not an exception.
As a prank, Loki shaves off Sif’s hair, long and beautiful, “the color of a field of barley at the end of summer.”
The problem?
Sif is Thor’s wife.
“Loki Laufey’s son,” said Thor, “if you do not put her hair back right now, I am going to break every single bone in your body.”
“Dwarfs,” shrieks Loki, recalling that these are capable of making just about anything – even golden hair.
In the end, Loki convinces the dwarves to design much more than Sif’s golden hair – aka, all of the treasures of the gods, including Thor’s hammer.
How did he convince them?
By promising them his head; however, he didn’t promise them their neck, and that’s why he got away alive and well from all this.
OK, not that well: one of the dwarves, 
, sew his lips: they were on the head, after all.
The Master Builder
“The Master Builder” shares basically the same structure with “The Treasures of the Gods.”
A mysterious man comes to Asgard and promises the Aesir to build them an impenetrable wall around their realm; all he wants in exchange: the hand of the goddess Freya.
She is the goddess of – among other things – beauty and sex, so get used to men wanting her hand in exchange for a big favor.
Now, the gods don’t want to agree to such an exchange, until they are convinced by Loki, who in turn, hides a card up his sleeve: deadline.
And the deadline for this mysterious man is six months.
However, what neither Loki nor the other gods know is that this man’s horse, 
, is a magical one; and it becomes apparent that the deadline should be no problem for the mysterious man.
“You made this mess,” say the gods to Loki. “You fix it.”
And Loki does: he disguises himself in a mare and seduces Svadilfari; afterward, he even gives birth to an eight-legged horse, 
, Odin’s favorite!
The Children of Loki
This chapter tells the story of how the handsome Loki seduces the giantess 
, who in turn gives birth to three monstrous, evil children:
• 
, a mighty and vicious wolf;
•
the queen of Hel, the realm of the shameful dead, who did not die nobly in battle; and
• 
,
“the Midgard serpent. One of Loki’s children and Thor’s nemesis.”
Freya’s Unusual Wedding
An ogre named 
steals Thor’s hammer, the most powerful and fearsome weapon ever created.
He vows to return it to Asgard on one condition only: if he is given the hand of Freya in return.
The gods – and Loki, in particular – have another plan: they agree but have no intention of following through with the terms.
Instead, Thor and Loki disguise themselves as Freya and her maidservant respectively and go to the ogre’s castle.
At the moment when Thrym brings out Thor’s hammer at the wedding banquet, Thor steals it and slays all the ogres.
The Mead of Poets
This is the longest chapter of Gaiman’s 
but it’s not exactly the most interesting ones.
It concerns the mead of poetry, a mythical drink which is such that makes everyone whose lips touch it either a skald or a scholar; unless you connected the dots yourself already, skald is the Norse word for poet.
The mead of poetry was created from the blood of a wise man named 
 after he was killed by the dwarves 
.
After some time, Fjalar and Galar also killed a giant named 
and his son 
came to the realm of the dwarves to revenge him; the dwarves offered him the mead of poets in compensation; he accepted it and gave it to his daughter 
to keep it.
Years passed before Odin found out; under a false name, he went to work for Suttungr’s brother 
proposing to work for nothing but a few drops of Suttungr’s mead. 
However, Suttungr would give none.
So, Odin transformed into a snake, stole the mead and then turned into an eagle and flew away with it; afterward, he gave the mead to both the gods and the men worthy of it.
Thor’s Journey to the Land of the Giants
This is a strange story.
Thor and Loki travel to the land of the giants, Jotunheim, as guests of the giant king named 
.
Utgardaloki challenges his divine guests to many competitions and Loki and Thor lose all of them – to their utter dismay and surprise (after all, they 
gods!)
However, Utgardaloki later reveals to them that he beat them only through the use of illusions: they didn’t try (and failed) to consume more than Logi or run faster than Hugi, but they competed against Wildfire and Thought themselves – which is what the words “logi” and “hugi” actually mean in Norse.
So, in a way, this is a story about how even the Norse gods don’t really understand ancient Nordic languages.
The Apples of Immortality
Loki – as if it is possible to have a good story without him – is captured by a giant with a Chinese-sounding name, 
.
So as to earn his freedom, Loki promises Thiazi that he will steal Aesir’s apples of immortality and that he will bring them to Thiazi.
Loki does that and, as is only usual with him, this merely creates bigger problems: now the Aesir is mad with Loki and forces him to retrieve them.
Loki says OK and has no choice but to fight Thiazi.
Fortunately – for him at least – he kills him and retrieves the apples.
The Story of Gerd and Frey
The story of 
 and 
 is a story of love – you know, the Romeo and Juliet kind that’s bigger than even the threat of death.
Frey, an Asgard god, falls in love with Gerd, a giantess.
In order to win her love, he needs to prove it by granting the giants his magical sword, the one which is prophesized to save him in the final battle, the Ragnarök.
And you know what he does?
He gives up the sword.
Gaiman thinks he shouldn’t have:
Hymir and Thor’s Fishing Expedition
Thor’s fishing expedition with the giant 
 wouldn’t have been remarkable or interesting if it hadn’t included a meeting between Thor and Jormungandr.
If that name rings a bell, that’s one of Loki’s sons, the enormous serpent lurking in the seas of Midgard.
Thor nearly catches it and kills it – but the emphasis is on nearly.
Unfortunately, Jormungandr would survive until Ragnarök when it will be killed by Thor, who won’t tread more than nine paces before falling dead himself, having been poisoned by Jormungandr’s venom.
The Death of Balder
the son of Odin and 
,
is both known as “the beautiful” and loved as such by everyone in Asgard.
Did we say everyone?
We meant to say “everyone but Loki.”
After Balder dreams of his own death, his mother Loki makes all living things vow never to hurt her son; and all do so willingly – with the exception of the mistletoe.
Of course, Loki uses this information and makes a magic spear which he subsequently gives to Balder’s blind brother Hod, who then (guided by Loki) kills his brother with it.
There’s only one vile enough to plan all of this – realize the gods.
And that’s the demise of Loki.
The Last Days for Loki
After the death of Balder, Loki flees Asgard to escape punishment for his vicious crime.
However, the Aesir eventually find his whereabouts and catch him.
His punishment?
Being bound to a rock for all eternity – with the entrails of one of his sons!
That’s the Viking Prometheus for you!
Norse Mythology Epilogue
Ragnarok: The Final Destiny of the Gods
Neil Gaiman’s 
ends the only way a book on Norse mythology should: with the Norse apocalypse, the Ragnarök, the battle to end all other battles between Loki, his children and the giants on one side and the Aesir on the other.
Everybody dies in the end, including Thor (killed by the poison of Jormungandr) and Odin (killed by Fenrir); in addition, the world of humans is consumed in its entirety by fire which leaves nothing but ashes behind it.
Loki, the master planner behind it all, both kills and is killed by 
.
Seeing the destruction around him, “it is done,” whispers Loki, dying on the battlefield. “I won.”

“Can’t wait for the weekend.” How many times do you repeat this like a mantra during the long week? Catching up on sleep is a global sport.
Hence the sleep crisis that engulfed our lives so completely that we don’t really remember ever feeling fully rested.

Yes, yes, success is achieved by working day in and day out. Or is it?
You say now that you’re willing to pay the price. But in a culture that preaches sleep as a commodity when it’s the exact opposite, where do you draw the line?
Are you willing to spend the rest of your days as a zombie – a mindless being – sacrificing your health?
If so, then please disclose the last time you were really present at work, not daydreaming, or nodding off every ten seconds.
We should understand that sleep represents a crucial element for a sustainable life – being able to reap the rewards of a

If you want to focus on creativity, you need between 7 – 9 hours of sleep a night.
HEALTH / THE SLEEP REVOLUTION
“The Sleep Revolution Summary”
, a sleep evangelist, has a Masters in Economics from Cambridge. She featured twice in TIME’s list of the world’s 100 most influential people.
Aside from being a bestselling author– check out our summary of 
 ­­– Huffington is also a media entrepreneur.
In spite of her busy schedule, she prioritizes sleep. As you’ll discover in 
, the commitment to do so means introducing a new habit into your routine.
The main idea of the book starts with Huffington’s desire to shift our perspective and change our reckless view on success.
She describes sleep in the first pages as “
”. She also proposes the means to lead our own sleep revolution.
There’s no universal recipe, so each one of us must try out different tools and techniques in order to determine which ones are useful.
Because 
 of falling asleep and getting a restful night is different for everyone.
Keep in mind that:
All of Arianna Huffington’s books evoke common points, which we (as humans) don’t find too much amusing. Guides and Call-to actions masterpieces are her expertise just like –  The Sleep Revolution.
You are looking at a possible call to action writing with one priority in mind “Sleep.” As you can see this is just good sense, however, many people have other priorities leaving sleep as a second-hand non-activity.
Activity is not an independent entity; a person requires rest to perform any physical or mental task.
“Night Birds” is a term used in some European countries which refers to people who use their nighttime hours for something other than sleep.
Whatever work you have, try not to prioritize it at the expense of rest.
Technology is the biggest culprit for this situation, affecting young adults mostly. In all four parts of the world, entrepreneurship regards sleep as a complete waste of time.
There is no such thing as inefficient time; this book summary will guide you through the process of knowing how to get the best out of your life.
Nevertheless, sleeping too much is not advisable either, it all depends on the person’s character.
There are no strict rules for this life or death matter. According to some testimonies, 
 have, in some severe cases experienced a collapse.
“The Sleep Revolution” is a step by step call to action masterpiece, understand its meaning and adjust to nature.
is divided into two parts: Wake-up Call and The Way Forward.
The first section is composed of 6 chapters that have the role of an intervention, going through “Our Current Sleep Crisis,” “The Sleep Industry,” “Sleep Throughout History,” “The Science of Sleep,” “Sleep Disorders,” and “Dreams.” Science and history meet, compelling even the most stubborn skeptic to agree that our society suffers from a sleep crisis.
Huffington starts with her own experience of burnout when she woke up in a pool of blood as a result of her body shutting down. This marked the beginning of her quest of putting sleep first.
Sometimes we have our nightly conversation with our brain to ‘turn off all the noise’ and ‘go to sleep already’.
So, the 2
 part – The Way Forward – helps you with diverse “
”
It will spring into action your quest to improve your relationship with sleep. You’ll start “Mastering Sleep” by beginning with your family habits.
Examine the pros and cons of having a bed partner in “Sleeping Together.” Onwards you’ll explore the “What To Do, What Not To Do” before putting your head on the pillow, then the effects of naps and traveling in “Catnaps, Jet Lag, and Time Zones.”
You’ll see the current changes in “Sleep and the Workplace,” as awareness reaches top-level executives about the importance of rest.
Then “From Hollywood and Washington to Hospitals and Hotels” the power of sleep is clearly stated and advocated.
As you’ll find out that sleep is also “The Sports World’s Ultimate Performance Enhancer,” you’ll hopefully be “Putting Technology in its Place (Not on Your Night Stand).”
In the end, after a myriad of notes, a “Sleep Quality Questionnaire” 
 with sleep.
Furthermore, in Appendix B, you’ll find guided meditations to help you fall asleep are featured, and then in Appendix C are examples of hotels implementing changes to improve their clients’ experience regarding sleep.
Appendix D explores the latest mattress innovations and their importance in the sleep revolution.
The Key concepts of 
are:
Remember that:
Here are five actionable things you can do starting today from 
’s book:
Moreover here are some of the theories from 
 that you can apply in your daily life:
Sarvshreshth Gupta, a 22-year-old Goldman Sachs analyst, spent two consecutive sleepless nights when he called his father at his office at 2:40 a.m.
Although Gupta’s father had tried to calm him down, a few hours later Sarvshreshth was found dead on the sidewalk in front of his luxurious apartment.
He could not stand the pressure of work and jumped out of the building.
Like Gupta, Americans today are suffering from sleep deprivation through a job binge, ‘workaholism’.
Workaholism is increasing. Between 1990 and 2000, the annual average American workload increased by one week.
By 2014, when a travel company named Skift conducted a survey to find out why few people were buying travel packages, it was discovered that about 40 percent of the American workforce didn’t even take a day’s vacation that year.
This unhealthy culture of workaholism prevents us from having a good night’s sleep.
In fact, according to a report prepared in 2010 by the American government, 30% of all employees have less than six hours of sleep per night, with nearly 70% describing their sleep as insufficient.
And who suffers the most from it? The working poor. Workers in the lower classes often have several jobs to pay their bills, so they do not have the time to make sleep a priority.
A 2013 survey by the University of Chicago found that a person’s quality of sleep diminishes as his wealth decreases.
And this causes drowsiness and can lead to various sleep-related illnesses.
Being overworked is not the only problem for the poorest. A professor at Stony Brook University has found that disadvantaged neighborhoods are also usually noisier, making it even harder to get a good night’s sleep.
As a child, did you have trouble staying awake at school or wanted to take a nap at your table before starting activities? Well, this could have been a good solution!
Sleep deprivation begins very early when children are pulled out of bed to go to school before their bodies and minds are ready to wake up.
In 1998, a team of researchers from Brown University conducted a study on the effect of early school hours on children’s health.
They found that children did better when school started at 8:15 in the morning, but then older children suffered from the schedule changes that required them to be in the classroom at 7:20 in the morning.
The researchers removed these children from the room at 8:30 and assessed their drowsiness.
Half of the children fell into a deep sleep only three minutes after lying down – a situation that usually only happens with people suffering from narcolepsy.
Students are pathologically tired when they are forced to get up so early every day to go to school.
This situation interrupts their natural sleep rhythm, the circadian rhythm.
When students have better nights sleep, their performance improves.
In 2011, the Technion Institute of Technology in Israel found that the level of attention of its students improved considerably when classes started at 8:30 am instead of 7:30 am.
A British high school in North Tyneside tried to take classes that started at 
, and their students began to earn better grades in exams.
In an episode of Seinfeld, George Costanza buys a custom-sized, foldable table that can turn into a bed at the push of a button.
The table allows him to sleep in the office without anyone knowing about it. Thankfully this kind of behavior is no longer needed in many modern workplaces.
Some workplaces have the benefit of nap rooms so that employees can compensate for sleep.
Despite the prevailing opinions, on the contrary, sleeping at work is not a sign of laziness.
When nap rooms were introduced to the offices of The Huffington Post in New York, many officials were skeptical. Four years later, the rooms are constantly full!
Other big companies like Ben & Jerry’s, Zappos and Nike also followed the example of The Huffington Post.
Companies can promote healthy sleep habits in other ways as well. Such as ensuring that they have a sufficient number of windows.
Natural light also creates a calmer atmosphere and is necessary for your body’s biological clock.
A 2014 study conducted by the University of Illinois, found that employees working in windowless offices lose an average of 46 minutes of sleep per night.
Why? Because our bodies need natural light to maintain circadian rhythms.
And in addition to the nap rooms and windows, there are other ways to rest: sleeping at work or working from home.
Staff sleep better and save time in transportation if they can sleep at work, so flexible office hours are very productive.
And according to a Stanford University study on Chinese workers, working from home is even better!
The study found that employees who worked at home were about 13 percent more productive than those who only worked in offices.
People believe that married couples have always slept in the same bed throughout history. But in reality, this custom arose at a time when few families could afford separate beds for each member.
So, should you and your partner sleep in separate beds if they can afford it? Not necessarily – sleeping together can also generate benefits by strengthening your relationship.
According to a 2014 study at the University of Hertfordshire, 94% of couples who sleep with bodies in contact with each other are happy with the relationship.
For couples who do not sleep with the bodies in touch, that number is 68%.
In reality, the correlation between relationship satisfaction and sleeping near the partner is so high that the more distant the couple sleeps, the less satisfied they will be with the relationship.
But that does not mean couples need to sleep 
. It is more important that both of you sleep well – 
.
Think about the stats again. The second number was lower, but still, means that 68% of couples who do not sleep together are happy with the relationship.
The important thing is that both partners have good nights of sleep, whether or not they are in the same bed.
Partners who cannot sleep properly will rarely think about sex. In fact, a 2015 study found that a woman’s desire for sex is directly correlated with her amount of deep sleep.
For every extra hour of sleep, there is a 14% increase in the likelihood that she wants to have sex on the same day.
The leopard is the earth’s fastest land animal. Leopards can run 60 miles per hour in a matter of seconds – but they also sleep about 18 hours in a day to rest. Unfortunately, human athletes are not always that wise.
People often believe that sleep deprivation is a good move in the sporting world.
Jon Gruden, one of the newest and most successful coaches in the National Football League or NFL, wrote a best-selling book called Do You Love Football ?!
Winning with heart, passion and not much sleep.
In his book, Gruden takes pride in being one of the NFL’s senior coaches if he considers his nights of sleep because he works for long hours.
George Allen, one of his rival coaches, boasted of sleeping in his office every night and working about 16 hours a day while sleeping only 4 or 5 hours a night.
Gruden and Allen are unaware that this type of sleep habit will only hurt their 
 – and the performance of the players, who also need to get good night’s sleep.
In reality, having good nights sleep can mean the difference between winning or losing.
Cheri Mah, a researcher at Stanford University, experimented on this phenomenon with basketball players.
Mah noted their performance on the court by measuring race times and success in three-point baskets.
So she rated each player again after they had slept 2 more hours per night – from 6.5 hours to 8.5 hours of sleep.
Having a rest at night allowed players to slow down the race time by 0.7 seconds and score nine extra three-point baskets!
What’s the last thing you do before bed? Do you watch an episode of House of Cards? Write some email? Do you read any news? These activities may seem like leisure, but make sure that you are not addicted to your electronic devices.
Today, people are increasingly addicted to their gadgets, and a surprising amount of people take them to bed! According to the Consumer Mobility Report of 2015, 71% of people keep their cell phones close while they sleep.
People are also more likely to get addicted to social networks; And this is especially bad for our sleep.
Heath Cleland Woods, a sleep researcher at the University of Glasgow, found that people sleep worse when they are emotionally 
, and with that, they also suffer from anxiety.
Emotions and stress are not the only problems with social networks; The blue light emitted by our devices also keeps us awake.
The light coming from the device screen suppresses our natural production of melatonin, a substance that helps us sleep. And that’s part of why so many people stay awake beyond their natural sleep timings.
According to psychologist Dan Siegel of UCLA, it is a vicious cycle. When darkness appears, the body usually begins to secrete melatonin, so much that we get to sleep within a few hours.
However, according to Siegel, if you’re staring at a device’s screen all night, your body does not believe it’s bedtime, even if it’s late.
When we finally try to sleep, we do not have enough melatonin to help us.
So if you want to have a good night’s sleep, put your computer and phone away from you until 9 in the morning. Try reading a book!
Let’s say you’ve taken away your computer and phone, but you still can’t sleep; It may be time to try some more direct action. You may not know it, but jabbing a few needles in your ear can help you sleep!
Acupuncture is an efficient and natural way to improve your sleep. People have used it for centuries, but now modern medicine already confirms its effectiveness.
Researchers at Emory University conducted a research on ancient sleep studies and found that about 93% of research confirms that acupuncture is an efficient way to cure insomnia.
Also, several studies have found that ear acupuncture points are helpful in encouraging deep sleep.
According to the Toronto Center for Mental Health, this happens because the stimuli at these points increase the production of melatonin and help reduce anxiety.
If you do not have time to visit an acupuncture practitioner, you can even try to apply pressure on your acupressure points.
Apply pressure on several spots on your wrist, ankles, and ears, and breathe deeply. Use your intuition. If you want to be more precise, you can seek the advice of a specialist.
Medicinal herbs like lavender can also improve the quality of sleep.
Dioscorides, a physician from ancient Greece, wrote about the tranquilizing properties of lavender at the beginning of the first century.
It was widely used in ancient Greece and Roman baths to help guests relax.
Modern science has already confirmed the powers of lavender as well. It has already been proven that it can lower heart rate, lower blood pressure and skin temperature – another important factor to sleep well!
So you can try different herbs and aromas such as lavender or valerian root, and find out which oils work best for you.
Have you heard of a technology that you can wear? We are not talking about T-shirts with screens or dresses with computer chips.
We are talking about devices that you use to monitor their biological functions – like sleep!
There are some technological devices currently available to improve sleep, such as intelligent sleep monitors and artificial light for sleep.
A French company has created a system to improve sleep in 2014.
This system consists of two appliances, one that you should keep close to the bed and that controls the levels of noise, light, and temperature in the room. It also uses light and sounds to wake the person up when sleep is enough.
The second appliance should be placed under the mattress. It measures heart rate, breathing, and involuntary movements during sleep.
We have seen how blue light can be harmful to sleep patterns. Fortunately, technology is working to end this!
The f.lux application, for example, softens your screen light at night so your melatonin levels are not interrupted.
You can also use technology to access tools for meditation or to help you relax. Forgetting the daily stresses and anxiety is an important part of a good night’s sleep.
And meditation can help you with that. There are many meditation guides available online, like Louise Hay’s videos that can be accessed on YouTube.
Methods such as conscious attention to breathing or Feldenkrais can help you fall asleep.
Feldenkrais is a method that allows you to gradually increase your body awareness and relaxation, making small and slow movements.
These devices and methods may work very well, but alone they will not fix your sleep problems.
You need to make sure you’re prepared to sleep, and you need to commit to it.
To conclude our journey: once you’ll read 400 pages of research studies, tools and techniques, history, and at times traumatic life experiences, I have faith that you’ll reconsider viewing sleep as the enemy.
As I see it 
by 
promises a new dawn for our culture, with clearer minds and rested faces – a comeback to the times when sleep was seen as an ally.

The basic idea is to construct a framework that’ll be valid for all types of industries at any given time. This framework describes the behavioral and decisional processes needed to survive disruptive changes.
Established companies have a hard time keeping up with the recent trends because they fail to acknowledge the necessity for revolution. Even if you dominate the market, you have to rely on innovations as a way of staying afloat.
This is not the 20
 century! Profit-based organizations cannot outmaneuver nor overshadow customer-centric companies. Technological evolution demands your ingenuity and creativeness to solve problems.
Always being on the lookout for improvement, can give you the upper hand in a full-competitive battle. Outdated technologies are obstructing sales, production, management, marketing, you name it.
Any niche is in desperate need of modification, which can only be brought by minds who think alike. Goal-oriented individuals driven by forward-looking vision have no intentions in pursuing higher profit margins without planning.
The trick is that intuitive decisions and market planning only work for sustaining products or services – the ones based on an already existing basis."

Lysa
TerKeurst delves deep in her personal experiences of rejection (which includes everything from being shunned and hated by a lady at the gym to being abandoned by her father) to help readers fight it and live through it while feeling loved and accepted.
As she explains honestly – unlike other too confident people – she hasn’t chosen the topic of rejection because she has mastered it or because she has overcome rejection in every way.
She has chosen it because she believes that digging into the core of who we are and exposing rejection’s deep infection is important and is the first step towards healing yourself.
Exposing, she warns her readers isn’t tidy; but it is honest, and it is good.
And, in her mind, it is the only true way to God’s embrace and His endless and unceasing Love.
“The more fully we invite God in,” she writes, “the less we will feel uninvited by others.”
Do You Still Want to Ignore Honesty?
“In the quiet of an early morning,” writes Lysa TerKeurst at the very beginning of 
, “honesty finds me. It calls to me through a crack in my soul and invites the real me to 
. Not the carefully edited edition of the me I am this year.”
“No,” she goes on, “honesty wants to speak to the least tidy version of the woman I’ve become. The one I can’t make look more alive with a few swipes of mascara and a little color on my lips.”
And then she concludes: “Honesty is a suitor with piercing vision who isn’t swayed by pretending and positioning.”
Unfortunately, we go through life losing a bit of the real us day by day; you are one person at home, another one when you enter your office and yet a third one with your friends.
Why?
Because you want to protect yourself from pain; because every part of your unconscious works in such a way that should help you adapt more easily to your environment and 
 the other way around; and, as days go by, you become a 
.
Enough with that!
Time to turn to yourself and listen carefully to the words your soul speaks; by definition, honesty will never attempt to hurt you – it will always try to heal you and help you chase away the lies which make you feel bad.
Why?
Because when you’re honest – regardless of anything else – you are

One God, Two Fears, and Three Questions
After telling the sad story of her childhood (“my dad fed my fears every day,” “
 was not something that graced my dad’s vocabulary”), Lysa realizes that she owes the feeling of being “the unwanted one” to a faulty interpretation of her relationship with her father.
Namely, after her dad left her and her family – not that he had been emotionally around before that – Lysa came to an earth-shattering (but obviously wrong) conclusion: “I don’t matter. I am worth nothing to my dad.”
And an even more disturbing one: “I fear I am worth nothing to God.” 
“The sum of these feelings,” she concludes, “became my new identity.”
If you’re anything like us and about 90% of the humans inhabiting the planet, probably that’s the way you’ll interpret any rejection: it’s not him/her – it’s me.
How do you trick your brain into thinking the truth, how do you counter the many rejections that will undoubtedly come along your way and all the unpredictability of life?
Link your identity to something permanent, something eternal, something unchanging, and something unquestionably loving and good.
God.
Here’s Lysa’s mantra which helps her in the difficult moments of her life:
Of course, it’s one thing to say these 
, and a completely another one to live them out.
How do you do that?
By developing an “intimacy-based identity,” which starts with answering three core questions:
• Is God good?
• Is God good to me?
• Do I trust God to be God?
The answer to all of these questions – and Lysa offers quite a few arguments taken straight from the Bible – is yes.
Getting Out of the Rat Race
Ever since the Industrial Revolution, humanity has spent countless hours into trying to find ways to automate processes and earn itself some free time.
Three centuries later, we can see nothing but the futility of this project: somehow, we have less free time today then we’ve ever had throughout all known human history.
In a way, 
, we’ve become hostages to our own progress: “we’re still obsessed with growing, even when there’s not much room left to grow in.”
Lysa TerKeurst writes exactly the same: “we run at a breakneck pace to try and achieve what God simply wants us to slow down enough to receive.”
“Jesus doesn’t participate in the rat race,” she writes. “He’s into the slower rhythms of life, like abiding, 
delighting, and dwelling – all words that require us to trust Him with our place and our pace.”
A nice little fable sums up why you need to slow down to understand the meaning of life:
Even science backs this: 
.
Ten Things You Must Remember When Rejected
As far as Lysa TerKeurst is concerned, the answer to the question “What’s a brokenhearted person to do?” is a sentence which mentions God no less than ten times: 
“We must praise God, seek God, look to God, call to God, experience God, fear God, learn from God, honor God, draw near to God, and take refuge in God.”
And that’s exactly how many things she says you need to remember if you want to rise out of your own ashes when rejected.
And here there are:
#1. One rejection is not a projection of future failures.
#2. Rejection doesn’t label you; it enables you to adjust and move on.
#3. This could be an invitation to live in expectation of something else.
#4. There is usually some element of protection wrapped in every rejection.
#5. It’s good to ask the “what” questions but less helpful to ask “why.”
#6. Don’t hash, bash, or trash on the internet. Remember, the internet never forgets.
#7. There’s much more to you than the part that was rejected.
#8. What one person sees as your liability, another might see as a wonderful asset.
#9. This is a short-term setback, not a permanent condition.
#10. Don’t let this heartbreak destroy you. Let this breaking actually be the making of you. Let God use it in good ways to make you stronger and take you further.

The Devilish Mechanics of Rejection: How a Line Becomes a Lie
“Rejection isn’t just an emotion we feel,” writes TerKeurst in the introductory chapter of her book. “It’s a message that’s sent to the core of who we are, causing us to believe lies about ourselves, others, and God.”
And how does this work?
Well, you start by connecting a trivial event from today with something harsh someone said to you ages ago; let’s say, someone hasn’t answered your Facebook message yet even though the “seen” icon is there for hours.
This reminds you of a line, say the one your ex-boyfriend dumped you with: “I don’t want you.”
The line, coupled with this new event, turns into a label: “I am not accepted.”
And, before you know it, the label “I am not accepted” evolves into the lie you wake up with and the one that destroys all of your future friendships and relationships: “I am not worthy.”
“We project the lines of rejection we heard from our past on others and hold them accountable for words they never said,” concludes TerKeurst. “And worst of all, we catch ourselves wondering if God secretly agrees with those who hurt us.”
So, in a way, rejection steals the best of who you are by reinforcing the worst of what’s been said to you.
How you should counter it: with honesty, brutal honesty.
And with honest and profound faith in God and his love towards you.
The Benefits of an Intimacy-Based Identity
In TerKeurst’s research on rejection and experience with it, she has discovered the two core fears that feed a person’s sensitivity to rejection:
• the fear of being abandoned;
• the fear of losing one’s identity.
Unfortunately, every rejection makes both of these fears too tangible and too real to be easy to overcome rejection.
However, TerKeurst sincerely believes that you can do it: the only thing you need to do so is God and a profound feeling of attachment to him.
Why?
Because when your impermanent and self-loathing identity is tied to something All-Loving and Eternal, you can remain the way you are as long as you live. And also: because then you’ll never be completely abandoned.
TerKeurst calls this “intimacy-based identity,” and she says that you can start building it by answering these three questions with a “yes”:
• Is God good?
• Is God good to me?
• Do I trust God to be God?
She offers reasons for each of these three “yeses” by quoting verses from 
, with which 
abounds.
Read them if you need a guide to these “yeses.”
Ten Things You Must Remember When Rejected
These may be the ten most important things you need to remember from this book – so we’ll repeat them twice:
#1. One rejection is not a projection of future failures.
#2. Rejection doesn’t label you; it enables you to adjust and move on.
#3. This could be an invitation to live in expectation of something else.
#4. There is usually some element of protection wrapped in every rejection.
#5. It’s good to ask the “what” questions but less helpful to ask “why.”
#6. Don’t hash, bash, or trash on the internet. Remember, the internet never forgets.
#7. There’s much more to you than the part that was rejected.
#8. What one person sees as your liability, another might see as a wonderful asset.

Our Critical Review
“Lysa TerKeurst has an undeniable gift for sharing her heart’s struggles in ways that strengthen and equip the lives of others,” writes Chris Hodges, Senior Pastor, Church of the Highlands and author of Fresh Air and Four Cups. 
And he is right: TerKeurst does this in a gentle, poetical, uplifting manner as very few authors are capable of.
However, as we said above, unless you’re Christian, TerKeurst’s message might not reach you – or at least you may not feel its mildness and warm-heartedness.

The world trembled at the sound of the 2016 Presidential Elections.
Hillary Clinton was defeated, and framed Donald J. Trump of colluding with the Russians, and accused him of being a collaborator.
What led to this?
Let’s dig up the mystery and see what was going on behind the curtains.
Who Should Read “The Russia Hoax”? And Why?
Let’s take an apolitical stance here, and for argument’s sake, try not to take sides in a political sense.
 is mainly a revelation related to the whole mainstream narrative tilted against the current president of the United States.
As such, we encourage everyone with the slightest interest in US politics, to give it a read.
About Gregg Jarrett
 is an American news anchor, author, and an attorney who joined Fox News in 2002.
He voiced concern over the alleged crimes and violations committed by Trump’s administration during the Elections. 
Gregg called out Hillary for her email controversy and compared the FBI to the KGB (Former Intelligence Gathering and Counter-Espionage Organization within the Soviet Union).
“The Russia Hoax PDF Summary”
You must have been living under a rock unless you’ve heard the rumor spreading like wildfire, that Donald Trump mingled with the Russians to defeat Hillary in the 2016 Presidential Elections.
It all started with Hillary’s private server and email scandal.
Many wonder, why Hillary Clinton wanted to keep her communications as a secretary of state on a private server?
Probably because that way, she could avoid applying the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in its full extent. Before taking office, she made a pledge of sustaining full transparency and vowed to embrace and fulfill all acts from the FOIA.
A sequence of events arouse suspicion, and the FBI launched an investigation to see whether passing classified documents was handled carelessly.
They came to a startling discovery when they realized that Obama has been acting negligently as well. Exposing Hillary would have probably brought Obama’s egregious violation of 
 and security to light, as well.
Hillary continued to act irresponsibly and would often breach security protocols, but no one dared to oppose her.
Even the State Department security personnel had to intervene because Hillary had a habit of keeping her BlackBerry in an area where hackers could easily penetrate and gather valuable intel on US policies.
In 2014, the House Benghazi Committee demanded that Hillary Clinton gave access to her emails which she reluctantly accepted.
It was later discovered that Hillary withheld more than 30k emails, that she claimed were of more personal nature.
Many of the shared ones, were classified but that didn’t prevent her from using an insecure server.
There’s no doubt that Hillary was aware of breaking the federal law and neglecting the State regulations.
After being scolded and pinned down, Hillary decided to delete more than thirty thousand of her emails, even though she received a congressional subpoena to preserve them.
This is by many regarded as a clear obstruction of a federal investigation and a violation of the Federal Records Act. 
Many believe; among them is former independent counsel Joseph diGenova that Hillary didn’t want to abide by the rules.
Despite holding a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School, she acted in direct confrontation with the law and should have been charged with embezzling government documents.
A sufficient amount of evidence shows that Clinton felt invulnerable and above the regulations.
Despite breaking multiple federal laws, Hillary defended the utility of the personal server as a tool for convenience. 
On July 5
, 2016, James Comey held a conference to unravel the violations of federal law committed by “someone.” 
The entire country believed that Hillary’s political career is about to receive a hard blow.
But that’s not what happened.
After dismissing Hillary’s notion that she didn’t know which files are classified, and exposing the threat to National Security, James Comey refused to proceed with the prosecution and said the following:
When the evidence laid out showcases violations of security protocols, it should be regarded as a basis for the Department of Justice to step in. 
James Comey had no grounds whatsoever to make such statements and give preferential treatment to Hillary.
The American public might also remember the prosecutions of Berger, Petraeus, Deutch, Nishimura, and Saucier whose crimes and transgressions resembled the Clinton case.
But none of these individuals who had access to classified and top-secret documents served time behind bars.
For their negligence, they were denied other privileges.
Much of the information behind FBI director James Comey’s decision was concealed, and criminal charges were not pressed against former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. 
Some even argue that the FBI (some people in it) were directly linked to the exoneration of Hillary despite the meticulous case laid out against her.
Despite the irrefutable evidence that strongly upheld the claim that Hillary’s misdemeanor threatened the country’s security, she was let off the hook.
The American public, especially those leaning to the right of the political spectrum, were kept in the dark.
Some FBI agents and lawyers bent over backward to conceal as much as possible regarding the damage she has caused and kept her away from testifying to Congress.
According to Gregg, the word “truth” is, by all means, a distant concept to Hillary and always has been.
Back in 2010, under Obama’s administration, the Russian Federation tried to obtain uranium assets and have them shipped to Moscow. The FBI was keenly aware of the strategies used by the Russians which involved bribery, racketeering, extortion, but decided to keep their mouths shut.
The evidence was considerable, and there was no doubt that venal individuals had a role in facilitating the transaction.
It was not until William Douglas Campbell exposed the means by which the Russians planned to seize American uranium, that the whole case came to a clearing.
Campbell also discovered that Russia was assisting Iran in its attempt to obtain Nuclear warheads.
In light of this new evidence, the American Public and Congress became curious regarding the involvement of Clintons in the whole deal-making process. 
Apparently, Hillary Clinton used its position to confer special privileges to the Russian Federation in exchange for millions of dollars in donations to her foundation.
After the loss in 2016, she realized that foreign companies wouldn’t be too keen in proceeding with the donations, which is what she was fearful of. 
As it turns out, Hillary Clinton put the blame on Trump for colluding with the Russians.
With no substantial evidence to back it up, the FBI launched an investigation.
It was clearly a hoax contrived by corrupt officials within the FBI and the Department of Justice.
As Gregg puts it – perhaps they were motivated by the Stalinist way of judgment: 
The method of disparaging a presidential candidate was nothing new in modern-day warfare, and it was driven by the political dislike of American institutions.
The ICA report found no evidence whatsoever that Russia had successfully influenced US elections by discrediting Hillary and elevating Trump.
When Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada sent a letter to James Comey, claiming that evidence confirming Trump’s alleged collusion continues to pile up, all hell broke loose. This was the most bizarre and fraudulent case ever brought up in recent American Politics.
Donald Trump was basically accused of being a Russian agent, working against American interests.
Congresswoman Maxine Waters, renowned in the political sphere for her intemperate attitude, promised that she would unwrap Trump’s agenda that might undermine the pillars of US democracy.
What followed was silence as she offered nothing to support her statements.
The Intelligence Services once pressed to the wall, had to admit that there was no proof of collusion, despite the narrative continuously pushed forward by the mainstream media.
What was the fuss all about?
Apparently, Trump talked to the Russians, as if it is a crime to talk to someone.
More than one thousand US businesses currently operate in Russia, and the Government itself has signed trade deals on a bilateral basis.
A throwback to 2008, when Barack Obama paid a visit to Germany before the Presidential Elections, no one said that he was conspiring with the Germans.
But, that didn’t stop anyone from fabricating a dossier to be used against Donald Trump.
And yet the FBI decided to criminalize and prosecute protected speech, while at the same time, they saw nothing wrong in conferring benefits to foreign legal bodies (including governments) in exchange for money.
John Brennan, former head of the CIA, decided not to take a critical view of the dossier nor vouch for its authenticity. As a person wielding a lot of power and influence, his job was to dive deep into the alleged offenses, according to which Donald J. Trump had the upper hand in the Presidental Elections.
That’s not what he opted to do, instead, he leaned on untrustworthy sources which were not credible in the least.
When turned upside down, the “dossier” was literally a collection of rumors, agendas, plots, conspiracies, suspicion, speculation but no evidence. The false statements gained momentum with the help of the mainstream media, but they lacked validity. 
Upon reading the content, Brennan surely must have known that it’s by no means trustworthy.
Due to the nature of his job, he was supposed to be an apolitical voice, but instead, he chose a more biased approach.
Let’s look at it this way.
In order to search a house, you need a warrant issued by a judge. The same applies when the government wants to keep an eye on someone and penetrate its personal life. You need to provide reliable information that is obtained from credible sources before you receive the go-ahead.
But that surely wasn’t the case with the Clintons.
Hillary partnered with the DNC, and through their lawyer, Elias solicited negative research on Trump and his campaign. The goal was to set the stage for other accusations while claiming that it’s only opposition research. 
What followed was probably the biggest turnaround in American Politics, when Donald Trump became the 45
 President of the US.
Special Counsel investigation that commenced in 2017, also known as the Mueller probe found no evidence whatsoever regarding the Russian interference in US elections.
The Witch Hunt was brought to a halt.
Key Lessons from “The Russia Hoax”
1.      Focus on trust, not on deceit
2.      Lay out your program
3.      Accept the outcome
Focus on trust, not on deceit
The political game is not for those with the faint of heart.
However, living by the rule – ends justify the means, will do you no good on the long run; which is what 
.
Lay out your program
When you want people to vote for you, your whole narrative must be built around your Party’s plans, not someone else’s inclinations.
Perhaps, the next Democratic candidate should keep that in mind.
Accept the outcome
Prior to the big event, Hillary said on numerous occasions that Donald Trump must accept the results of the elections.
And yet, it was the Democrats who failed to do so.
Try to keep your word, and you’ll improve your ratings among the people.

America has had an interest in South Asia ever since its creation.
Has it evolved or devolved?
Srinath Raghavan tries to answer the question in:
Who Should Read “The Most Dangerous Place”? And Why?
If you want to learn more about the history of USA’s involvement in South Asia – there’s certainly no better place to start than Srinath Raghavan.
Be warned though: South Asia means “India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan” here; even though we can’t suggest you titles, we’re pretty sure that there are better books on US relations with Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.
About Srinath Raghavan
 is a political commentator, bestselling author, and Senior Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi.
In addition to 
, he has also authored three books on India’s security and foreign policies: 
, and 
.
For his work, Raghavan has received two notable prizes so far, the Infosys Prize for Social Sciences and the K. Subrahmanyam Award for Strategic Studies.
“The Most Dangerous Place PDF Summary”
What This Book Is About in Short
 by Srinath Raghavan is perhaps the best book one could read if he or she is interested into finding out more about the history of United States in South Asia – India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan more specifically.
At more than 400 pages, the book covers almost every event of importance – and many practically unknown in the West (and, thus, even more significant) – from 1784 to 2018, both through the eyes of South Asians and, for the first time – via thousands of pages of declassified documents – through the eyes of the highest echelons of American politicians. 
And, in retrospect, these have been two pretty eventful centuries, during which American interest in South Asian countries has come a long way; particularly in relation to Afghanistan after the fall of the Soviet Empire, and, even more, in relation to India after 1947.
You’ll find everything you’re interested in here: from the first contacts of Americans – mainly missionaries and merchants – with South Asia to the history of the American alliance with Pakistan; from 
 to the birth of Bangladesh; from the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan to 
And after 379 pages of history, in the very last of the ten chapters of 
(“The New Century”), Srinath Raghavan turns to the most recent landmark events, covering everything from 
 and the invasion of Afghanistan to the nuclear rearming of India and Pakistan.
The final point?
America’s present interests in South Asia can’t be understood without a little history; and, without it, USA’s decision-makers will go on making the same mistakes over and over again – as they have already done quite a few times in the past.
The Murder of Mohammad Mansour
In a way, Srinath Raghavan’s final point is merely the corollary of an even more important one: the USA keeps getting South Asia wrong and tries to correct its mistakes by making new ones.
In fact, that’s how the book opens, with an analysis of the expected versus the actual effects of the murder of Taliban’s then-leader Akhtar Mohammad Mansour via a drone attack in Pakistan, on May 21, 2016.
When Barack Obama announced the killing at a press conference two days later, he hailed it as a victory, for two reasons: it was both the decisive “part of a strategy to bring Taliban to the negotiating table” and an attempt to “send a strong signal to Pakistan that it could no longer harbor Taliban leaders while pocketing American financial aid.”
However, the assassination delivered neither of these two desired outcomes.
The Taliban quickly chose Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzad to be Mansur’s successor, and, under his leadership, Taliban attacks all over Afghanistan escalated. In addition, USA’s relations with Pakistan worsened, because the Pakistani government denied claims that it had been harboring Taliban leaders.
As it was revealed about a year later, this was the truth: to say the least, the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) wasn’t that fascinated with Mansur, and it might have been ISI the organization which created the trail that eventually led the Americans to Mansur.
Two years later, the USA’s dealing with the very same problems, if not a bit worsened:
Three Lenses of Analysis
As stated in the “Introduction” Srinath Raghavan’s 
tries to illuminate the history and evolution of America’s interactions with South Asia – in addition to India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives as well – through three lenses.
This was the first thing which drove merchants of the young American republic to the Indian subcontinent somewhere near the end of the 18
 century.
However, the interest quickly waned, since American capitalists realized that they have a continent-sized market at home, so they don’t need another subcontinent for now – especially in view of the fact that, unlike theirs, 
.
However, the times changed, and after the 1930s, American interest turned yet again to the Indian subcontinent; and this time – it was a bit more personal.
American businesses weren’t just interested in profits and South Asia’s markets anymore: they also “wanted to preserve capitalism globally in order to ensure that the United States was not forced under an autarkic path.” 
Consequently, financial interests were now both military and political – and it was difficult to distinguish where one of these ended, and another one began.
For example, 
, but the USA still provided financial aid for the country “in order to ensure that it did not move into closer orbit around Moscow.”
On the other hand, even though Pakistan’s economy wasn’t exactly thriving, the USA backed India’s neighbor both politically and militarily – just in case India 
 move from the bloc of unaligned countries into the Eastern Bloc.
Speaking of the Cold War…
The second dimension of the USA’s interests and interventions in South Asia is purely ideological.
“From the start,” reminds us Srinath Raghavan, “a religious belief in divine favor and a political faith in republican liberty have shaped American ideology.”
And whether we’re talking about Thomas Jefferson’s idea of “empire of liberty” or Barack Obama’s avowal of the United States as the “indispensable nation,” the idea that the USA has a “providential role in helping the spread of liberty has conditioned American engagement with the wider world.”
South Asia is, of course, not an exception:
“The third major dimension of US involvement in South Asia,” writes Raghavan, “is culture, in particular, religion, race, and notions of hierarchy.”
Naturally, these were the first three things the Americans noticed after arriving on the Indian subcontinent.
And as it has been demonstrated numerous times in the past, almost all of them were repelled by the primitive rituals and practices of the Hindus.
In view of them, the egalitarian notions of the Muslims seemed much more Christian, and, thus, “more comprehensible and palatable.”
This shaped the American politics for much of the 19
 and the first half of the 20
 century: compared to the “beastly” Indians and their outdated Hindu religious views, Muslim Pakistan and Afghanistan seemed like much more suited to be allies.
The paradox?
Even though Americans – and Europeans – were appalled by the rigid social hierarchy of the Hindus, they based their judgment of South Asians on unscientific ideas of racial superiority.
And even after the Nazis “had discredited overt racism in international politics,” this old hierarchical view hasn’t disappeared to this day.
As Raghavan shows, it has merely been substituted with another one in “American theories of modernization” which rank societies “not explicitly on race but on a scale of ‘development.’”
However, as an interesting backlash, these notions of hierarchy are continually being subverted by American intellectuals, and on a pretty familiar terrain: religion.
Namely, after the 1970s, 
 leading to a sort of a South Asian cultural and religious boom which is still going on.
In fact, one could even argue that nowadays it seems much more modern 
 or a Buddhist (and practice yoga and meditation) than to be a Christian or a Muslim and go to church.
A Brief History of US Involvement in South Asia
The first American ship sailed to South Asia in 1784; back then, the flag on the vessel was still unrecognized by most of the world and the Indians who saw it first were no exception.
As we said above, the reason why the American arrived in South Asia was simple: profits. They knew everything about it through the British East India Company which ruled the subcontinent and exported large quantities of Indian produce (especially textiles and spices) to the American colonies.
However, the British East India Company was just too big to be meddled with (or fail), and for the next century and some, America wasn’t that interested in South Asia.
However, the interest was rekindled by the end of the 19
 century, courtesy of none other than Rudyard Kipling and his very popular – and very racist – poem “White Man’s Burden.”
Theodore Roosevelt liked the poem so much that he grew liking the British Raj as well and called for American colonization of the Philippines.
In addition, Swami Vivekananda’s “Sisters and brothers of America” speech introducing Hinduism at the Parliament of the World’s Religions of Chicago in 1893 received a standing ovation from thousands of US citizens.
There was an even bigger fascination for Mahatma Gandhi back in the US, but the partition of Pakistan from India in 1947 led to Harry Truman’s arms embargo on both countries.
During the time of Nehru and the Non-Aligned Movement, the USA realized that “risks to US security from a weak and vulnerable India would be greater than the risks of a stable and influential India.”
So, it provided financial and political aid until the “dangerous decade” between 1970 and 1980 when the world was on the brink of a nuclear war because of the inherent problems in the political landscape of modern South Asia.
At the end of the decade, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan opened new problems for the US, and for a while, it looked as if the world’s Western superpower had lost its primacy over South Asia to the Soviet Union.
The United States got closer to Pakistan because of Afghanistan, but this threatened its relations to India.
 “In the decade following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,” writes Raghavan of the effects of this, “the US’ relationship with India underwent a paradoxical change. On the one hand, the tremendous expansion in American aid to Pakistan for services rendered in Afghanistan met with deep disapproval from India… On the other hand, there was a change in the bilateral relations owing primarily to India’s aspirations to economic transformation at home.”
During the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the US-funded Islamic extremist organizations such as Al-Qaeda and Taliban in the hope that this would weaken the Soviet influence.
And they did.
However, it was these very two once-allies which became USA’s greatest enemies after the end of the Cold War, a quite conflict which culminated in the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the American invasion of Afghanistan.
In recent years, the US interest in India and Pakistan has been mainly governed by the fears of a nuclear war between the two countries and the rise of China on the East.
As a consequence of the latter, the current Indian government led by Narendra Modi is the first one to explicitly “tilt heavily” toward America, in an attempt to mend the “power gap” opened between India and China – something which the USA has wholeheartedly embraced.
Key Lessons from “The Most Dangerous Place”
1.      USA’s Interest in South Asia Has Three Dimensions
2.      The USA Preferred the Muslims Over the Hindus for Centuries
3.      Fierce Enigmas: Americans Never Understood South Asian Nations
USA’s Interest in South Asia Has Three Dimensions
According to Srinath Raghavan, USA’s interests and involvements in South Asian history can be understood through three lenses: power and profit, ideology and culture.
Historically, it all began with an attempt to profit from the vast market of the Indian subcontinent: the first Americans to arrive there had been merchants.
After several attempts to change the “primitive” cultural landscape of the regions, America’s foremost interest was ideological: the USA wanted to win the Cold War and India, for example, was a Non-Aligned country.
The USA Preferred the Muslims Over the Hindus for Centuries
Even though it’s hard to believe this in retrospect, after their first arrival on the Indian subcontinent, the Americans were so appalled by the primitive rituals of Hinduism that they thought they’d have a much better understanding with the Muslims.
And this went on for a while until the military backing of Al-Qaeda and Taliban (as an indirect way to weaken the Soviet Union) backfired and resulted in the 9/11 attacks.
Interestingly, now Hinduism, Buddhism and other religions and practices of the subcontinent are all the rage this side of the Pacific.
Fierce Enigmas: Americans Never Understood South Asian Nations
Srinath Raghavan’s main point of the book is that the USA has never completely bothered to understand South Asia, resulting in a series of costly mistakes.
In fact, the American edition of

If you haven’t read the much-talked-about 
 bestselling classic, then you’ve been missing out on a lot.
In this book, Robert Kiyosaki zooms in on the path you need to cross in order to achieve full financial freedom.
There are many hurdles to overcome, and the most prominent one of all is the education system itself.
Let’s dive right in.
Who Should Read “Rich Dad’s CASHFLOW Quadrant”? And Why?
The CASHFLOW Quadrant exemplifies the spirit and mindset of various groups of people.
It showcases how one must act to avoid being devoured in today’s digital age of information.
With that in mind, it’s clear as to why Robert prescribes “
” to the general audience.
About Robert T. Kiyosaki
 built a name for himself, after managing to climb the entrepreneurial world in quick succession.
Apart from having written a bestseller which has held a top spot on New York Times bestselling list for half a decade, he has also excelled as an investor, educator, and entrepreneur.
It’s also important to say that his teaching methods are not in line with conventional methods for improving one’s financial position.
Among other things, he also wrote the following books:
“Rich Dad’s CASHFLOW Quadrant PDF Summary”
Part One – The CASHFLOW Quadrant
Back in the days, when Robert still wasn’t geared up with the right mindset, he found that changing quadrants is anything but easy.
It’s certainly complicated to shrug off criticism, remarks, and words of discouragement coming from your closest circle.
That especially holds true if you “hail” from a family that embraces and nurtures the “Employee” quadrant (composed of highly educated individuals who prefer safety over freedom).
This is only a small list of questions, regularly delivered at Robert’s doorstep. 
The circle-shaped diagram lays out the irrefutable truth regarding the failure of “A” students.
Let’s say that a person is highly educated by worldly standards, but it struggles to find emotional and spiritual balance. How will that reflect on its decision-making?
Probably by compelling him/her to enter into what is known as 
The irony revolves around the following theory – this process is presented as an antidote or the formula behind making the right calls. Depriving yourself of real action sooner or later will prove to be self-destructive because people making the most mistakes are the ones winning on the long haul.
So, before we move on, let’s take a critical overview of the Four Elements within the Quadrant.
Where do you belong? – is the critical question.
It’s absurd to claim that you don’t fall into either of these categories because we all do.
Poor Dad will teach you to go to school, get a degree, get a nice job, and become a well-paid employee. While, Rich Dad (often less educated in the formal sense of the word) will advise you to absorb the benefits of state-controlled education, build a business and become an investor.
Let’s debunk the first myth – 
.
Not true!
In 1985, Robert and his wife Kim were at the brink of financial and emotional collapse. They lived in a small basement room for nine months; making a few dollars here and there to keep food on the table and fuel in the gas tank.
Their plight lasted for an entire year, while their friends and family relentlessly pushed the idea of getting a good job.
At the time, it was truly a challenge to remain true to their perspective.
In 1994, they finally achieved their financial freedom! 
Rich Dad, unlike Poor Dad, doesn’t pretend that money isn’t important. On the contrary, he believes that achieving financial stability is the cradle of life itself.
The skills needed to excel on the right side of the Quadrant are by no means taught at school. 
It’s foolish to think that some Quadrants are better than others because it’s beyond doubt that we need people to contribute from all parts of the financial spectrum.
With that said, you need a different set of characteristics and skills to flourish in each Quadrant. 
In other words, it’s not whether you can create a better burger than McDonald’s; it’s about creating a system that serves customers.
According to Rich Dad – success is a poor teacher. 
You need to experience loss, in order to get into the right frame of mind and hence climb the ladder of prosperity.
Part Two – Bringing Out The Best in You
While playing Monopoly with Rich Dad, Robert learned a couple of lessons that shaped his mindset:
In the meantime, Robert realized that money or better yet “receiving money” is a drug like no other. 
Rich Dad often said: 
For precisely that reason, Rich Dad puts emphasis on creating or building a system that makes money for you.
School days are gone; it’s time to build a system around your heart.
And, this what shocked Robert the most, because in the late 70s his wallet company collapsed due to competition and lack of passion.
After years of experimenting and monitoring, Robert Kiyosaki came to the conclusion that it’s safer being on the right side of the Quadrant than on the left.
So, how to get rich?
Above all else, this is not a get-quick-rich scheme that you ought to follow (no questions asked).
The sad reality is, people who work the hardest, are not the ones that get rich. Rich People are outliers; their out-of-box mentality is what distinguishes them from the mob.
Poor people believe that the goal is to work hard in order to buy things that make them look rich.
In fact, rich people want to get as far away as possible from the stream of liabilities.
Before we go any further, let’s have a gander at one completely neglected battlefield between the rich and educated.
Robert recalls one encounter with his Educated but Poor Dad who said: 
“
”
Robert calmly replied: 
.
It was a clear indication that playing it safe, and trying to be on the right side, was, in fact, the riskiest strategy one could’ve come up with.
To be successful, one must be emotionally neutral regardless of the outcome.
You have to understand that winning and losing is part of the process, and you mustn’t separate one from the other.
As you already know, Robert took the path less traveled.
The greatest transition was not the resignation letter, but the itchiness in embracing a full-scale alteration with regards to beliefs and mindset.
Truthfully, the main reason behind people’s lack of prosperity is not that they lack education or willingness to put up a lot of time and effort into something, but being guided by fear alone.
Often times, we hear people arguing that there’s some global conspiracy that keeps increasing the wealth gap between the rich and the poor.
But, is it beneficial to pass on the blame to some external phenomenon? 
Give it a moment to sink in!
Part Three – How to Become Successful B and I
Robert starts the last section of this book, by pointing out that instead of looking forward to gigantic strides, just take the first baby step.
In order to get the ball rolling, you need to be wary of false narratives and misleading information that may stigmatize your endeavors.
After years of research regarding the transition from poor to rich, Robert found out that these people possess three qualities:
And the same applies (only reversed) for families who have lost their fortune in 2-3 generations.
To bring awareness to this issue, Robert asked students to fill in their financial statements. Those being on the verge of financial breakdown had an Industrial-Age mindset (or the no tomorrow mindset) which is predicated on the notion that the government should take care of you.
Although the rules have changed, these people still believe in hard work as if that will solve all of their financial problems.
The CASHFLOW of the rich starts at “Assets,” and it is steadily distributed to the first box “Income.” Unlike the middle-class dream, which only strives to cover expenses and liabilities by getting a good six-figure paycheck on a yearly basis.
Robert often gets asked – How to initiate this transition and start thinking like a Rich Person?
First off, it’s not wise to jump out of bed and start investing without any previous knowledge whatsoever.
So, the painless path is composed of reeducation, trial, learning-by-doing, and ultimately succeeding.
The only that ultimately matters is building up your Assets column, which in the Informational Age is of absolute importance.
Here is the seven-steps formula for achieving financial freedom:
After getting to the bottom of the CASHFLOW Quadrant, a person or a group needs to find out where it belongs.
Upon illumination, it’s their job to decide their next move.
Are you eager to evolve, or stay put?
For those of you who are not quite convinced in Robert’s philosophy, continue reading and delving into the matter as much as you can.
But refrain yourself from making excuses such as:
These are all legit reasons, but Robert argues that ascribing security to the left side of the Quadrant, is highly inaccurate.
It all boils down to the following statement:
Key Lessons from “Rich Dad’s CASHFLOW Quadrant”
1.      Find your Cash-Cow
2.      Change Quadrants if needed
3.      Stay in the game
Find your Cash-Cow
Cash-cow is nothing other than a steady source of income or profits that eclipses all the money needed to initiate it. 
It’s your job to find a steady stream of revenue by acquiring assets that will be the backbone of your financial liberation.
Stay on it!
Change Quadrants if needed
It’s not appropriate to advise or even to think that all people should move on the right side of the CASHFLOW Spectrum.
However, one must understand that security no longer comes from hard work.
Times have changed, and resisting this transition could be the instigator of financial malaise.
Stay in the game
Remember how Robert overcame the negative voice and dodged the meaningless questions crafted by those who have no financial education?
Well, you should do the same, because it’s not going to be all sunshine and rainbows.

But how much do you know about Michelle? Well, here’s your chance to learn the basics:
The summary of Michelle’s memoir 
Who Should Read “Becoming”? And Why?
If you want to learn more about Michelle Obama – and delve into Barack’s story from a different perspective – then 
is the book for you.
Since it is “an intimate, powerful, and inspiring memoir,” it’s also a great read for everyone who wants a little motivation; especially if she is a working mom who wants to make a little difference in the world.
About Michelle Obama
 is an American lawyer and writer, USA’s First Lady from 2009 to 2017.
Born and raised on the South Side of Chicago, Michelle graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School, after which she found a job at Sidney & Austin, where she met future President Barack Obama.
An educated advocate and campaigner against obesity and poverty, Michelle Obama was considered by many a role model for women and a fashion icon.
In addition
to
, she has also authored 
.
“Becoming PDF Summary”
As everybody knows, 
is the deeply personal memoir of former US First Lady and downright Rockstar Michelle Obama. 
It tells the entirety of her story through 24 chapters (plus a preface and an epilogue), divided into three suggestively titled sections:
• 
: which covers her childhood and her education up to the time she met Barack;
• 
 which tells the story of Michelle and Barack up to the moment Michelle’s husband was elected President of the United States; and
• 
: which describes Michelle’s and Barack’s life at the White House.
Now that you know the outline, it’s time to get into some more detail!
Becoming Me
Michelle LaVaughn Robinson was born on January 17, 1964, and lived in a house just 9 miles away from the place where four years later a violent clash would break out between the police and Vietnam War protesters.
What was Michelle doing at the time?
Why, of course: she was playing with her dolls; to this day, as she makes it more than clear in the “Epilogue” of 
, she has remained put off by the “nastiness” of politics, “the tribal segregation of red and blue, this idea that we’re supposed to choose one side and stick to it, unable to listen and compromise, or sometimes even to be civil.”
Anyway, Michelle Robinson had a wonderful childhood.
She was the daughter of a creative jazz-loving father, Fraser Robinson III, a Democratic precinct captain, and a generous mother, Marian Shields Robinson, who was a full-time housewife until Michelle entered high school and a secretary at Spiegel’s catalog store afterward.
The Robinsons – Michelle also has a brother, Craig, two years older than her – lived on the second floor of a two-story house; Michelle’s great aunt, Robbie, and uncle lived on the first floor.
Robbie was a piano teacher, and at about the time of the unrests which marked the 1968 Democratic National Convention, Michelle started her piano lessons.
Back in 1950, fifteen years before her parents had moved there, Chicago’s South Side had been 96 percent white. 
By the time Michell would leave the place for college in 1981, it would be about 96 percent black.
So, in a way, Michelle was born right in the middle of that transition. A great thing, since that meant the neighborhood was racially mixed, with little Michelle’s friends being “a motley mix of last names – Kansopant, Abuasef, Yacker, Robinson.”
They may tell you that 
, but to those living there it was – and always will be – a home.
Be that as it may, Michelle was a precocious child and when in second grade she revealed to her parents that her classes are boring and that she hates them.
Her mother – her smart mother, might we add – got her tested and Michelle moved up one grade, a decision which (Michelle still thinks) greatly influenced her life.
Eventually, she ended up in the progressive Whitney M. Young High School: it took her two busses and about an hour and a half to get there; but, eventually, it was worth it.
Michelle excelled at her high school and was on track to be in the top 10 percent of her class, but still, when the time came, her college counselor told her that she is not sure Michelle is a Princeton material.
And Princeton, ever since Michelle’s brother Craig got into it (by the way, 
) – and ever since she had the opportunity to get to know the place – was Michelle’s top (if not 
) choice.
Fortunately, Michelle was from early on aware that “failure is a feeling long before it’s an actual result;” so, instead of allowing this judgment to topple her confidence, she used it as a motivation to get into Princeton.
And, eventually, she did.
There, for the first time in her life, she realized the meaning of the word division: less than a tenth of the students at Princeton were black.
Fortunately, Princeton had an organization known as the Third World Center (TWC), which was formed to support students of color.
And even more fortunately, at its head was 
, “a smart and beautiful black woman, barely thirty years old, a swift-moving and lively New Yorker who wore flared jeans and wedge sandals and seemed always to be having four or five ideas at once.”
For all students of color at Princeton, Brasuell was “an über-mentor,” an “ultrahip and always outspoken defender in chief,” and Michelle became not only her protégé but also her assistant.
Michelle learned a lot from her, including how to be a mom long before she became one: Brasuell was a single mother of a precocious boy named Jonathan, whom Michelle often babysat.
After taking her LSAT test, Michelle went straight from Princeton to Harvard Law School, after which she moved back to Chicago to start working for the respected firm of Sidney & Austin.
And there, she met a certain Barack Obama.
Now, this Barack guy came to Sidney & Austin for the same reason many promising law students did: to be advised on his next steps.
Unlike them, however, he was so exceptional – since he had taken a few years off before Harvard Law School, Barack was also a little older – that instead him being the advised one, he started advising Michelle’s colleagues soon after walking in the offices of Sidney & Austin.
Michelle was fortunate enough to be assigned for three months as Obama’s adviser, but she wasn’t that taken with him; for one, he was a smoker, and Michelle hated smokers.
However, after some time, Barack did manage to get through to Michelle and after the first kiss, “everything felt clear.”
Becoming Us
Now, Barack had to pass one more test before proving himself worthy of becoming Michelle’s husband: the test of her brother Craig.
And it was a strange test indeed:
After Barack finished his studies at Harvard Law School, he joined Michelle in Chicago, and in October 1992, the two married.
However, both of them were so much busy with so many side projects and ideas that, in the end, they didn’t have such a great honeymoon.
Namely, it had to be cut short, because Barack was enlisted to help the Project VOTE! Initiative. Michelle had a couple of projects of her own at the time, mostly through the help and influence of Valerie Jarett, then an unsatisfied lawyer who felt a calling to help people and, to do so, left her high-paying job.
Yup, we’re talking about Barack’s 
: he met her through Michelle.
All in all, being Obama had its ebbs and flows, more of the former at the beginning. “Tired and stressed,” wrote Barack about this time in 
, “we had little time for conversation, much less romance.”
After Barack’s success during the Project VOTE! campaign, an article in a Chicago magazine suggested that he should run for office.
Barack shrugged off the idea because he had a plan of his own: to tell his unusual life story in a book titled 
.
The book was published in 1995 to positive reviews and little sales; this time, when Barack was approached about entering politics, he didn’t refuse.
Michelle was skeptical: she believed that Barack could do much more good as the head of a non-profit organization; Barack dreamt bigger.
But the bigger the dreams, the bigger the burden.
And this became especially problematical after the birth of the couple’s children, Malia Ann Obama (born on the Fourth of July, 1998) and Natasha “Sasha” Marian Obama (born on June 10, three years later).
However, when you’re a politician and you have a family, you can be sure that, sooner or later, some of your opponents’ low blows will come into their direction as well; even when they’re not explicitly mentioned.
For example, a year after Malia was born, she got an ear infection in Hawaii, just at the time the Illinois Senate announced an emergency vote on a rather important gun control bill.
Barack chose to remain with the family (Malia wasn’t allowed to fly in her condition) and that earned him a few rather unpleasant descriptions, ranging from “educated fool” to “gutless sheep” to “a white man in blackface… using his child as an excuse not to go to work.”
Barack wasn’t hurt by these comments since he had expected them; Michelle, however, was deeply affected.
In time, Barack started skipping family dinners; Michelle wasn’t too pleased about this and she was even less pleased when Barack told her that he has an intention to run first for Senator and then for President.
The reason why Michelle allowed him to do this?
Because she was pretty sure that he would lose the Senate race, and she made him swear that if he did, he’d give up politics altogether and start dedicating more and more time to his family.
And then, Barack’s keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention came – it would be an understatement to say it was a success – and his Republican opponent for the Illinois Senator seat, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race due to a sex scandal.
To Michelle’s disbelief, people had started talking about Barack becoming the First Black President.
And as you know full well, a few years later, he did.
Becoming More
Now, being the First Lady doesn’t mean that you stop being a mother; and being a mother at the White House is a completely different matter from being a mother anywhere else.
And possibly that’s why, soon after moving to the White House, Michelle received a call from none other than Barack’s opponent in “the brutal 2008 primary,” Hillary Clinton.
After all, she had some ideas about it means to be a mother while also being the First Lady.
And, to tell you the truth, reading Michelle’s biography reveals that this is a lot more complicated thing than you can imagine; for one thing, friends of Malia and Sasha couldn’t just pop up to visit and play; neither could they run out to the garden without having their Social Security numbers checked by the authorities.
Michelle’s job?
To find a way to tell her children that the White House was their home and that they should treat it as such. Meaning: playing in the hallways is 
 allowed.
As soon as she became the First Lady, Michelle Obama was determined to use her position to make some good in the world.
The first thing she did, however, was a bit 
: she cultivated her garden, aka she decided to start one to make the White House feel more like a home.
Next, she started the Let’s Move! Imitative, which aimed to solve “the challenge of childhood obesity within a generation so that children born today will reach adulthood at a healthy weight.”
Its ambitious plan – to reduce childhood obesity to 5% by 2030 – was carried through in four different ways:
• informing parents about everything related to healthier dietary options;
• making the food at schools healthier;
• distributing healthy food to many rural and urban areas lacking fresh fruit and vegetables; and
• getting kids to be more physically active.
The results?
45 million kids are now eating healthier food, and 11 million are physically way more active than about a decade ago.
This success inspired Michelle to start the Joining Forces initiative (which helped more than 1 million veterans and their spouses get a job) and, then, the Let Girls Learn initiative which is still empowering girls by granting them their right to education worldwide.
Barack and Michelle Obama 
 and, looking back, Michelle is happy with what they accomplished.
However, she’s not that happy with the man who came to the office after them. Politics aside – says Michelle – this is a man who was heard by the entire USA to have habitually bullied women and got away with it.
This is what Michelle tried to make known to the world when speaking in favor of her husband’s one-time opponent and afterward, 
, before the election.
Here’s her take on the matters:
And that’s how we hold our heads – even when we lose.
Becoming Epilogue
In the “Epilogue” Michelle Obama reveals, yet again, that she isn’t that fond of politics; however, she makes it clear that she cares deeply about the future of her country, especially nowadays with an almost openly racist President.
“It’s been distressing to see,” she writes, “how the behavior and the political agenda of the current president have caused many Americans to doubt themselves and to doubt and fear one another. It’s been hard to watch as carefully built, compassionate policies have been rolled back, as we’ve alienated some of our closest allies and left vulnerable members of our society exposed and dehumanized. I sometimes wonder where the bottom might be.”
And she concludes with a plea for interhuman awareness:

Probably, you don’t own a large company, but if you do, there are a couple of things the master storytellers believe you can do better.
An essential part of building a brand is to associate it with a story that resonates with your audience.
So, how to do that?
Let’s find out!
Who Should Read “Building a StoryBrand”? And Why?
Before we go any further, it’s important to understand that this process applies to all organizations, regardless of their shape and size.
Even if you are just starting out in the business world, “
” is nothing less than a tool that will render assistance in the pursuit of market dominance.
Don’t be afraid to reshape your mindset, and get one step closer to prosperity.
About Donald Miller
 is an American entrepreneur, author, public speaker, and the CEO of 
.
He came to prominence by raising awareness of the interactions between brands and customers, and how both parties need to act.
Also, his 
 was on the New York Times bestselling list.
“Building a StoryBrand PDF Summary”
One thing is almost undeniably true – marketing has evolved. 
Businesses nowadays have to be more creative, data-oriented, and eager to learn in order to compete in a crowded environment. 
Among other things, Donald also points out that organizations which put the emphasis on stories will be the ones dominating the industries.
Mike McHargue or science-Mike jumped onto this thread, by explaining that our brains are hardwired to look for solutions or products that will help them meet their basic needs.
Upon doing this, people can turn over to more psychological, physiological, or even spiritual needs that give meaning to life.
And your job, 
, is not to shout nor scream in the ears of your customers.
It’s not about conveying the message loud enough but making sure that you are listened to.
Okay, off we go!
In addition, let’s dredge up the two most common mistakes most brands make:
Now, let’s shift to something of immense utility to all individuals.
How to capitalize on today’s behavioral patterns, and what principles you must embrace as a brand to facilitate this?
First off, one must understand that telling a story is the bridge between paying attention and neglecting something.
Donald Miller labels it as the best tool against the “noise” dwelling in the overly abusive and pushy culture.
Think of it as a Movie Trailer.
Prior to having the Video uploaded on YouTube, it undergoes a series of cuts, edits, omissions, retakes, etc.
It’s all done under the banner of “delivering” the story and captivating the audience.
If your main character in the story is suddenly interested in dozens of stuff, rather than excelling at one particular thing, your audience’s attention will suddenly flip upside down.
In 1983, Apple launched Lisa and contacted the New York Times to publish an ad that encompasses all the features this computer had to offer.
They soon found out that geek-talk is not going to fly anymore.
Instead, they partnered with Pixar, (a genuine storytelling factory) and went from 9-pages long geek-ad to “Think Different.”
Now that is a kind of message that will evoke interest and perhaps entice customers to give it a shot.
Apple reached new heights by following the three-pillar program:
Do you need a hero?
100%! 
Every story needs a driving factor or someone who can defeat the odds, rise to the occasion and come out a winner.
The challenges lying ahead must be perceived as an opportunity, not as a problem.
Last but not least, what will the hero’s life look like if he/she does (doesn’t) do what’s expedient?
You need to ponder these questions and give them a second thought because they truly are the 
.
From a customer perspective, there are also three questions of equal importance:
In order to eliminate the dull part of any message, companies and 
.
In this book, you’ll come across something called – SB7 Framework.
This framework acts as a filter that will help you in the endeavor.
Upon completion, the entire scope of the message will be put on a single sheet of paper also known as 
.
With that thing covered, let’s move over to the elements that compose the SB7 framework
The whole idea of brand-positioning must revolve around the hero, not the brand itself.
If you like to be regarded as a customer-centric organization, your customers mustn’t feel as if you are solely profit driven.
As the author puts it:
You might have been led astray by recent trends that are built around the idea that customers want solutions to external problems.
The bitter truth is that customers are willing to pay a lot of money for stuff that tackles their inner turmoil.
In the simplest form, a hero lives and dwells in relative peace and stability, until one day that serenity is threatened by something.
If you can address their needs, it goes without saying that they will turn into brand evangelists.
Perhaps, customers aren’t that much engaged in identifying a hero, as they are on the lookout for a guide or mentor.
In many movies and theatre plays, we bear witness to the struggles of the main character, who is in a stranglehold and requires assistance from someone.
This person elevates our hero and helps him/her to cope with the pressure of decision-making.
Evidently, brands need to establish some mental triggers that will incite customer to pitch in with the storytelling and act as if they are the ones propelled forward.
Customers don’t trust just anyone.
If you select a random hero from the crowd, there’s hardly any evidence that they’ll be convinced into following his/her agenda without a proper plan.
It shouldn’t come as a shock to you, that without information and planning, the likelihood of making the right decisions, decreases.
Also, Donald introduces us to two kinds of plans: the agreement plan and the process plan.
Both are predicated upon the idea of earning trust by detailed planning, rather than demanding it.
You might have noticed that heroes don’t take action unless challenged.
There needs to be a reason, or should you prefer – a trigger that will inspire our hero to take the high road.
Broadly speaking, there are two call-to-actions that actually work.
Don’t expect from your audience to jump on the bandwagon without being told to!
It’s pretty self-evident that people, in general, don’t prefer tragic endings.
Stories mesmerize the masses, but only if they reckon that something is at stake.
Apart from the anticipation and excitement, nothing is valuable nor worthy of their time.
In a nutshell – brands must explain to their customers the loss or the deprivation of quality that will emerge as a result of not doing business with them.
And they all lived happily ever after. Who doesn’t like Disney-tale endings?
Even big-shot politicians use this trick to bring people over to a more beautiful place – far away from mundane concerns.
If you fail to engage with your customers, someone else will!
It all boils down to this – Your approach or messaging strategy must lean on a vision that illustrates how your product/service might affect the lives of your customers. 
Now that we covered all the steps in the StoryBrand Script, it’s time to unpack the last aspect.
Everybody wants to change for the better, and people are in need of transformation!
Only brands that participate in this mental transformation can create brand evangelist (passionate customers). 
It goes without saying that at the outset; the hero is usually filled with doubt and self-pity, but as the story goes on, the hero develops skills and the mindset needed to wipe out the threat.
Likewise, you need to explain what prompted the hero to rise to the occasion and what are the consequence of not doing so.
Once you have mastered (or at least in part) the messaging process, it’s time to kick things off.
Probably, you have one by now, but we are talking about something else.
Long gone are the days, when brands needed millions of dollars to get traction and increase brand awareness.
 made it easier for growth-hackers and marketers alike to use creativity and psychological triggers. 
Instead of pouring money into some untraceable ads, you can build a Website that is relatively simple to grasp.
Here are the five basics that any Website should have and build its offer around them:
By now, you have probably understood the significance of transforming the minds of the customers, but what about the employees?
Employees, by all accounts, also require some clear go-to signals in regards to how the mission statement is implemented.
Donald Miller spotted an issue that crops up in almost every larger organization – 
.
Its appearance is triggered due to a lack of alignment between employees, and not having a story that will act as a bond.
To tackle this, companies introduced the well-known 
, but only a few brands managed to get everyone on board by doing this.
With StoryBrand Script even a dull task becomes somewhat of an adventure.
And you need all people under the same roof if you are keen on making progress.
In all honesty, a Mission Statement is nothing but a sequence of words; and since it doesn’t promote a way of life, it rarely makes an impact.
Key Lessons from “Building a StoryBrand”
1.      Get the word out
2.      Tackle division within the organization
3.      Find the hero in the story
Get the word out
Nobody will even consider your brand if you don’t take any action.
Although companies have been on that page for a while now; the ones that know how to do the right thing can be counted on one hand’s fingers.
Tackle division within the organization
If you fail to promote the effects of synergy and teamwork, your organization will either collapse or become less efficient.
The people in charge must move beyond the mission statement, and find a way to engage the employees.
Find the hero in the story
You saw that one coming?
Imagine how shallow it is to address the audience in a way that is only sales-driven?
Nobody is saying that you shouldn’t make money (obviously), but your customers must feel the push radiating from the story you are trying to convey.
A hero in their eyes is a victory in yours.

Has your business eaten most of your earnings? 
Are you an advocate for the “Bigger is better” philosophy?
Let us hear from Mike on why profits should be the only measurement of success and prosperity.
Who Should Read “Profit First”? And Why?
As the title implies, “
” tackles conventional business-doing logic, and puts profits at the center of operations.
No more excuses as to why you should plow back all of your profits, and not having a pinch at the chubby quarterly checks!
With that in mind, we reckon that “Profit First” is best suited for entrepreneurs and those in the making. Keep an open mind, dive right in!
About 	Mike Michalowicz
 (entrepreneur, author, keynote speaker) has had a lot of ups and downs in his career.
After selling two multi-million-dollar companies, he went onto becoming an angel investor.
Upon squandering his fortune, he set on discovering a formula that will ensure profitability from the outset.
His insights and methods are taught in Universities and applied by companies worldwide. 
“Profit First PDF Summary”
Putting together a list of qualities and ideas you came up with, and weaving them into a business plan is nothing short of a miracle. 
On top of that, being able to proceed with limited resources at hand, is certainly something to be admired. 
Perhaps, you’ve been there as well.
Eventually, you’ll start feeling as if this huge, money-making machinery, has turned into a cash-eating monster that needs to be tamed.
But how?
How can you address this problem? Most entrepreneurs put “growth” at the center of their endeavors, thinking that more sales, more customers, and more funding could salvage the situation. As far as Mike is concerned, Growth is only half the solution.
Some entrepreneurs even reckon that running a business is the closest you’ll ever get to experiencing a nervous breakdown beforehand.
It’s like a horror story, with no end in sight.
Woooah, let’s backpedal a bit to get a clue on how to fight off these tendencies.
Mike starts by pointing out that not every sale is a good sale.
Think of it this way, if you decide to create a new product add-on in order to increase your sales, but you don’t envision your company selling that kind of products; then you need to stop harming your business.
 as Mike likes to call it is a mindset that is not driven towards a vision. 
It’s an ill-considered decision predicated upon our desire to get out of a crisis, at the expense of our broader picture, which we often neglect.
In doing so, we end up squandering opportunities and money, taking bad clients, and making short-sighted decisions.
Revenue generation is by all accounts the pitfall we so often fall into.
As one falls deeper and deeper, it tends to justify anything that brings in more money even if that means evading taxes.
The devil is in the details – sounds familiar?
The GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) claims to have all the answers as to how a business can optimize its operations.
Start with sales, subtract direct costs (the cost of manufacturing or producing your product/service), pay the employees, subtract indirect costs, pay taxes, and then redistribute the profit.
This cycle is composed of 
, and 
Nice logic, but is it feasible?
As the monster grows bigger, it takes more effort to feed him.
Higher direct costs, higher wages, higher indirect costs, and then suddenly we are on a page where every client is a good client – regardless of how it can impact our business.
Meanwhile, our utilities increase and subsequently there are bigger issues and loans for you to take care of.
That’s why the Profit First system, is by far the most effective way of looking at a business.
What if you look at the profit first, instead of being just another 
?
The Profit First Accounting method, takes a different approach, and it revolves around not how much money you spend and earn, but the difference between these two.
While conducting this experiment, Mike realized that the paycheck-to-paycheck system is a living hell.
Fed up with insecurity, he set his thoughts on profitability and building a system that will underpin his efforts.
Here’s how to do it:
 – Go to your bank and set up four accounts: 
 – Set up two more savings accounts with a bank other than the one you are using for daily operations.
 – You don’t want any deals nor conveniences regarding these accounts.
Just deposit the money, and leave them be – forget about them, completely.
In the entrepreneurial world you’ll often hear this question – How big is it?
Well, if you have a dirty mind, this may seem laughable but people are actually talking about your business. 
How many employees, what is the extent of your operations, etc.
Profits? Nah, I would rather talk about something else.
Mike talks about a guy he met at a global entrepreneurial summit – Phil Tirone (the founder of 720CreditScore.com).
Phil told him that over the years, he witnessed the misconceptions most people had about wealth.
They are all hiding their financial predicament, and want to give the impression of 
, but that’s rarely the case.
Nowadays, the America business culture happily embraces the thesis – 
.
Even investors have given up on finding stable businesses that have become such a rarity today, that is almost unbelievable. Accumulating debt and living in a crappy apartment is regarded as the way to go.
If we keep putting profits at the bottom of our to-do list, we’ll never be able to enjoy the fruits of our labor.
How healthy is your business, to begin with? Most of the times, pretty detrimental, but where there’s a will there’s a way, and Mike has the answer.
This is a Profit 
 Form, and it will help you understand what it takes to make your business profitable.
No more day-to-day panic attacks, because profitability is not an event, but a habit and way of life.
If by any chance you feel overwhelmed by this book, Mike advises you to take a breather and come back when you feel ready to face the music.
Meanwhile, you are required to put at least 1% to a separate account and keep it low for a while.
Entrepreneurs, in general, encounter two problems when they embark on the Profit First system.
When you decide not to take caution like Mike did; out of habit, you’ll probably put the blame on the system.
On the other hand, if you rack up the profits like really quick, try to remain with both feet on the ground. It’s not over yet! 
The path leading to the impeccable implementation of the Profit First system is composed of a series of small steps, that give the impression of trivial tasks.
And remember, long gone are the days when everyone would get their fair share of the monthly work, except you (the owner).
Why would you even bother building something that condemns you to a lifetime of servitude? You would say, that’s the best way to achieve growth but is it? When you were first starting out, the business had very few employees (if any), and in fact, you were 10% entrepreneur and system-builder and 90% employee.
As the company grows (in terms of profit, not revenue), you’ll be able to transition from working for the business to working on the business.
So you might be wondering, what actions are required to make this happen:
: Determine your custom Profit, Owner’s Pay, Tax Percentage based on your industry
: Adjust the numbers in your Instant Assessment Form
One story that Mike lays out for us shows exactly how powerful your mindset can be when opting for the Profit First system.
A promising and gifted motivational speaker started off on the right foot by disclosing a step-by-step system that will help anyone to convert 80% of the audience when holding a speaking event.
One of the attendees accepted the challenge and went on to test it.
She managed to reach 25% in a short amount of time.
With time, she broke the 50% barrier and eventually landed the 75% mark.
At one occasion, she laid eyes on the instructor who advised her to use the system in order to increase sales.
She was curious to find out what is needed to reach the 80% milestone, and he replied: 80% I said 18%. 
The reasonable goals others have set shouldn’t be construed as your limit, but as an opportunity, for you to exploit.
Before you opt for a full-scale transition make sure to notify your accountant; a word of warning – you might not hear words of encouragement.
If that’s the case, find a new accountant.
Another thing that Mike believes to be noteworthy – this is not “
” kind of thing. It’s more like “
” kind of thing.
So, the first quarter is drawing to a close, and it’s time to see whether the strategy has panned out!
Sometimes, your fiscal year, will not match the calendar year, but let’s assume that it does.
On the first day of each new quadrant, you need to distribute the profit on your Profit Account.
Take 50% of what’s in there, and leave the rest as a reserve.
Try not to make any excuses as to why you shouldn’t do that. And if the company has multiple owners, distribute the profit based on the percentage of equity owners.
It’s celebration time.
Use your Tax Account to cover the finalization of taxes.
If you come short, use the money left in the Profit Account to reimburse the loss.
Make sure to give this book a nice read, because it covers way more things than what we could have listed here.
It’s worth it!
Key Lessons from “Profit First”
1.      Get your hands dirty
2.      Take action or collapse
3.      Fill in the shoes of great leaders
Get your hands dirty
Generating revenues can be both a blessing and a curse, depending on the structure of the business. Owners who go about hiring extra people in order to get as far away as possible from the operational responsibilities are the ones with the least healthy business.
Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but you should bear in mind that this will reflect badly on your income and profits.
It takes time before you can actually hand over the hard work to others, and focus on growth.
Take action or collapse
The business reality is anything but pretty.
Sometimes, you need to take drastic steps such as firing your accountant or doing some things that you’ve never done before.
It’s your job to embrace profitability as the only way to run a business, and not be merely a revenue-driven organization.
Fill in the shoes of great leaders
Great leaders know how to get things done, and there’s no “Can’t” in their vocabulary.
Gird your loins, and go out there!

The Simple Path to Wealth PDF Summary,https://blog.12min.com/the-simple-path-to-wealth-pdf-summary/,https://blog.12min.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image1-6.jpg,"8 min read ⌚ 
Attaining good position in society, and living debt-free is tough.
It’s needless to say that financial independence is just another word for enjoying life and retirement. 
Scratching your head over this, won’t do you much good, so let’s unpack the formula.
Who Should Read “The Simple Path to Wealth”? And Why?
When the author talks about “simple,” he mostly refers to the power that is currently resting in your hands.
So, no external elements could stop you in this pursuit, if you have the wits and fortitude to do what it takes.
With that in mind, it’s pretty accurate to outline that “
” is prescribed for any person who wants to escape the difficulties of financial dependence.
You’ll not be given a secret treasure map, but a proven approach that will likely improve the probability of achieving independence (in a financial sense).
About 	J L Collins
 is one of those guys you would say has a very “diverse” job experience.
From picking up metal ice cream cans to hosting a radio show, he truly had ups and downs regarding his career choice.
Having visited many countries and talked to a lot of people, he had this urge to share his encounters and revelations with the world.
Apart from being a writer, he is also a blogger (
) who tries to spread financial knowledge.
“The Simple Path to Wealth PDF Summary”
Even kids, broadly speaking, get the drift of what’s going on with the world, and how money is the great influencer. 
J L Collins starts by explaining that money bring pressure to bear on people, but not all of us can understand the complexity behind making money. In this challenging world, one is presented with two options:
The so-called, investors who are making the case that everything related to investments is so darn complex, are lying to you. It’s in their best interest to make you dependent on their “expertise” while they rack up the profits.
Also, the pursuit of financial independence mustn’t be associated with the notion of retirement. 
But, let’s take a quick throwback to where it all began.
As a young boy, Collins had this intrinsic characteristic to earn and save money. 
He would go from door to door, picking up pop bottles and making a few bucks here and there.
He also came to the conclusion that financial independence, is as much about being able to cover your needs, as it is about increasing your wealth.
The learning curve took an unexpected turn, when J L Collins at the age of 25, decided to travel across Europe. 
At the time, he didn’t know that working conditions were negotiable. 
He went to his boss’s office and asked for four months of unpaid leave. Upon getting a firm “No,” he went home to give this whole pickle a second thought.
After a while, he handed his resignation but was convinced to stay after he was given 6-weeks leave.
That day he learned – 
.
In the following years, he would experience a lot of ups and downs; unpaid leaves, tough decisions, remarkable revelations, and insights.
But, it will always seem as if freedom is something that you should bend over backward to achieve.
Unlike other books which put emphasis on buying your financial freedom, J L Collins puts stock in achieving it.
As you get older, you’ll understand the value of each day, and why you should not give any thoughts to “how things will work out.”
Over to more serious business – Debt.
The US alone has accumulated a debt of over $16 trillion, and while one side of the financial spectrum argues that it’s rejuvenating the economy, others fear potential collapse.
More than half of the debt can be assigned to mortgage debt; also a substantial amount (in trillions of dollars) can be attributed to student loans.
So, what should you do, if you already have one of these?
Even though the mantra is – 
, there are a couple of things worth considering:
So, what now?
Make a list of your spending habits, and debts ranked from the highest interest rate to the lowest.
Don’t hire a consultancy agency to help you out in this endeavor, because they cannot make it less painful than it actually is. You and you alone must make this work.
Once you have changed the ostentatious lifestyle into something more appropriate, then you can redirect the 
.
Is it going to be simple? – Yes, but not easy.
Are there any good debts?
Most people argue that mortgage debt is one of the very few ones, probably coupled with business loans that might generate a higher return on investment.
But don’t be so sure.
If you decide to build a home that far-greatly exceeds your needs, it might be hard to achieve independence.
When it comes to student loans, in the 70s, let’s say it cost about 1500$ to get into college and pay off your first year. 
Although inflation had a huge effect on the overall economy, it’s very unethical to demand from 19-year-olds to take on a massive pile of debt, sometimes racking up more than 200,000$ in order to obtain a college degree.
As one person put it – 
.
Another question that seems to be on everyone’s lips is – Can you retire a millionaire?
Technically it is possible for middle-class people to reach the $1million landmark in their lifetime.
It only takes around 2000$ a year of investment in the period of 30-40 years for one to reach that goal.
But, money is a very relative phenomenon, and the ultimate goal is to achieve financial freedom.
The secret is to spend less than you earn, invest the surplus and stay away from debt as if you are running away from the devil.
Investments and Money-Mindset
This world has no shortages of people who have reached the sky, earned millions of dollars only to declare bankruptcy years later.
Various factors contribute to that such as:
In the graph above, we can see the industrial growth in the 20
 century.
This is nothing but proof that industries will continue to develop, and grow with probably more rapid pace in the 21
 century.
Obviously, we want the gains the market can deliver, but you must understand the timing.
So, here how it goes:
You buy a stock at let’s say 100$ and the value increases to 180$. 
We need to sell at this moment, but when do we roll back into the game? At 20% slump or perhaps you should wait for a genie to whisper in your ear?
The point is – you need to be right twice (both high and low)!
The sad reality is – nobody can do it, because if someone could, it 
 than Warren Buffett, to say the least.
Do you start putting your money in an index fund, or perhaps going after top-notch companies?
Don’t start at all, if you are not prepared to see your wealth fluctuating or diminishing.
Not a good offer, ha?
It’s true that the market will grow in years to follow, regardless of overnight drops and crashes like in 2008.
So, here are the reasons why people lose money in the market:
They key to success is to keep it simple, and refrain from overreacting or being overly optimistic.
Even the simplest formula has to be decluttered and here’s how to do it:
When you give thought to these pressing matters and decide what kind of investor are you, then you can move on and create your portfolio. 
Jack Bogle, a renowned investor, and philanthropist who in his lifetime amassed a fortune of over US$80 million declared that not even he succeeded in besting the market.
The concept of indexing revolves around the idea of buying stocks at a given index.
The truth is – you can’t pick winning stocks and no one can.
You can get lucky though, but in the long run – the house always wins.
Intelligent and highly determined individuals see indexing as a challenge (probably to their vanity and intellectual capacity).
There’s a great analogy that highly correlates with what J L Collins is trying to convey here.
A couple of years back, he was taking street-fighting lessons.
The instructor said the following:
If you are not 
, then please keep your money into your pocket.
Don’t give it to a manager who promises you good results at the drop of a hat.
The greatest irony regarding investing is that the more you mess around with your portfolio, the less well you’ll actually do.
Put your eggs in one basket, and one day you might wake up rich.
Key Lessons from “The Simple Path to Wealth”
1.      Eliminate unnecessary spending
2.      Go for the long run
3.      Money eliminates the necessity of doing things that you dislike
Eliminate unnecessary spending
You would be surprised to know how much money you can save if you have a better plan.
Put all the financial liabilities and costs that might incur (monthly) on a piece of paper, and eliminate everything that you can do without.
Remember – A dollar saved is a dollar earned.
Think in the long run and be realistic
Many investors argue that they can beat the system and beat it consistently.
If they could, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett would be nothing more than mediocre achievers, compared to the skill-set of these people.
That’s why you shouldn’t go for stuff that are too good to be true.
Keep your composure, and actively invest over a larger period of time.
Money eliminates the necessity of doing things that you dislike
Out of fear, or perhaps due to our survival mindset, we are compelled to act in a given manner.
During this time, we feel this immense pressure and negative energy but are left with very few options.
Money, on the other hand, gives you the freedom to do as you wish.
Of course, there are some limitations, but much less than not

made me feel a little bit odd.
Why odd? I have almost six years of experience in sales. So after reading this book, I’ve realized that so many ideas presented here are the opposite of almost everything that I’ve learned all this time.
Using a mathematical approach, Mark Roberge made from his book a real guideline for anyone who wants to succeed in selling to businesses.
His manner of writing also draws my attention: well structured, very simple and easy to follow.
As Mark Roberge says, this blueprint for human resourcing has five main parts.
In the first part –

That is dynamic in the online media. The customer evolution is a fact that can’t be ignored. After all, we’re also customers in different contexts.
Think about it: what is the first thing you do when you want to buy something? These days we first search online.
Google seems to be the first reliable friend that we think of. Only after some time spent on searching we finally buy what we need.
That’s why all businesses have to keep up with this evolved customer. They have to make available and visible the offer to their target.
If you’ve ever been in the position to manage human resources of your company, you know how important it is for a company to have a

Simple and actionable steps for scheduling the right actions and designing a wise plan for your business.

This turned us into more 
 
during the buying process.
In this perpetually changing world, it’s getting harder and harder for sellers to accomplish their goals. In order to succeed, sale zones need intelligent people to do this job.
Experience so far has changed the vendor’s perception. Customers are more suspicious when they are approached directly by vendors.
They prefer to be the ones who take the first step towards the seller.
Through the eyes of the author, this book is meant to teach, prove and predict plenty of interesting things about the sales field.
But above all these, Mark Roberge is designing a brand-new image for the salespersons.
He’s doing his duty to change, 
 and bring more awareness of the salesperson qualities in the eyes of customers.
Roberge was the number 4 employee at Hubspot, and his main challenge was to scale the sales force during the first 7 years of the company. The team went from 1 employee in sales (himself) to more than 450 people among areas like sales, services, and support.
Most interesting of all is that, when Roberge started, he had no sales experience and that, to a certain extent, was an advantage.
Roberge is a software engineer by training who later migrated to the business area getting an MBA at MIT which allowed him to see sales through a point of view focused on technology and data analysis.
That was the mission that Roberge set for himself. To do this, he created 4 tactics that could help him achieve this goal:
These are some of the key points that allowed Mark’s acceleration strategies to succeed. Let’s take a closer look at them.
To build a scalable and predictable sales team, the first step is to hire the right people.
For Mark, there is no single vendor background that works for every business. Each company is unique and relies on its own context.
Roberge tried and managed to hire more experienced sellers from other well-known companies, but they did not stand out as much as he hoped.
Selling a product from a known company is simpler than the product of a 
.
The Hubspot sale was evangelistic, consultative, and unlike the other sales companies that had big teams. So Mark had to learn, in a way, in his own way.
Although each company has its unique candidate 
 and its own hiring process, it has chosen to create a standard method, such as an engineer,
.
He started by listing 10 attributes he sought from the candidates and believed to be the ones that would correlate most with success in sales.
Based on this, each candidate interviewed, and each candidate that was joining the company received a grade for each of these 10 criteria.
After 6 months using this process, he hired half a dozen people.
Some stood out, others not so much.
To understand this, he came back to analyze the performance of the best and try to understand what was consistent with his ideas of success attributes and what attributes were missing by reviewing his list of criteria.
Two years later, he already had dozens of vendors and enough data to do a regression analysis to understand, from the attributes he imagined correlated to success and which actually had the most significant impact on each candidate. Mark was surprised analyzing the results.
His list had attributes constantly associated with sales professionals, such as “ability to close deals,” “Objection Management,” and “
,” and incredible as it may seem, they did not correlate successfully with sales at Hubspot. In fact, in some cases, these attributes hurt the candidates.
The attributes that had a correlation with success were characteristics such as “Preparation”, “Knowledge in the area”, “Intelligence”, that is, characteristics of people with traits of consultants, counselors.
And that made Roberge understand that there was a difference in the buyer’s expectation as to precisely what a seller was.
The new buyer has much more control over the buying process, and so they seek out someone who understands it and manages real value for their decision making.
In Mark’s case (and he points out that this may not work for other companies), the criteria for predicting a candidate’s success were, in order:
And from that analysis, Mark ensured he knew exactly who he would like to hire for his commercial team and succeed at all times.
Once we have the right candidate, the next step is to ensure that the training is the same for all of them.
The market standard for training new salespeople at the time was simple.
Commercial directors hired new candidates and asked them to “stick” to the best-performing salespeople to learn by watching the other vendors sell.
For Mark, this did not seem scalable, and he noticed it early.
Although the sellers had the same set of characteristics, they were different. Some focused on 
. Others were terrific in rapport and connecting emotionally with their customers.
These different skills were not easy to pass from seller to seller because each seller succeeds in his unique way.
Therefore, he chose to create a standard training that went through the client’s buying journey, the sales process and a qualification matrix.
Mark and his team spent a month building their own methodology and ensuring that their vendors understood how the new buyer has more control over the new buying process.
The seller’s role is to help you in an advisory fashion to reach the end.
From there, he decided that at Hubspot, every salesperson should go through 30 days of training.
In this training, he needed to use the company’s software, know its functionality, and understand precisely what the company’s customers were doing with their product.
When these salespeople got on the phone to talk to their customers, they were actually able to explain how the product could help them, after all, they had actually put themselves in their place.
Another important point was that the sellers would participate in the digital communities where the buyers met. Blogs, social networks, LinkedIn groups, Twitter profiles, etc.
With hired and trained salespeople, it’s time for action and for that they need leads.
And the challenge is to ensure that salespeople have a predictable flow of leads coming in so they can work.
The digital consumer is already online researching solutions to solve their problems on the internet.
Therefore, it is crucial that the company does marketing on this channel and offers solutions for customers who are seeking to solve these issues and this is something that depends on the production of content.
Ideally, hire a journalist or someone with experience in the field. The person does not necessarily need to know everything about their company or area of expertise.
She needs to be able to talk to her team, her executives, and turn that knowledge into content for the end consumer.
The idea is that he interviews these people and, from that, he creates a free ebook, 1 
, 4 blog posts and posts on social networks.
The content of the blog and social networks lead people to download the free ebook, and in this process, the company can collect information from people who really have the problem you are looking for.
\Leads! Another important point is to align the marketing and sales teams.
To avoid the sales team from complaining about the quality of leads, volume, and abstract criteria, a more considerable alignment is required.
Roberge created with the marketing team an SLA (service level agreement) so that there was no abstraction when evaluating performance between teams.
With this, each lead generated by the marketing becomes a monetary value based on the conversion rate of that lead.
With SLA marketing, marketing and sales learn that, for example, if they give 100 leads that downloaded an ebook to a sales professional, he can connect with 30 of them, make 15 statements and close 5 contracts of $1000, making it clear that every lead that marketing is worth $50 in revenue.
Of course, different types of leads have different conversion rates, a user who downloads an ebook is less likely to buy than one who requests a product test.
To understand each type of lead, Hubspot created a matrix of lead education and from it, it was clear to understand the value of each lead and what conversion rate was expected for it.
Still, it is possible to model how much each lead is worth and what monetary value in leads marketing needs to deliver for the sales team to meet its goal.
In addition to marketing within an SLA, the sales team must also follow a predictable standard procedure.
Once the lead is received, how many contact attempts are required to be made until it closes or is discarded?
To do this, again Mark turned to statistical analysis and clearly defined how many tries had to be made for each type of lead.
In the end, he came to the conclusion that for small businesses, the ideal number was 5, for averages, 8 were needed, and 12 for large companies.
With that done, everything was automated in CRM and people came to follow this new model, making the valuable leads generated by the marketing were being treated with the attention deserved.
From then on, this SLA between both teams is tracked daily, and the results are visible to all.
The primary task of the sales manager is not to keep the pipeline up to date or to make sales forecasts.
The most important thing is to ensure that all the vendors are adopting the process and understand how they can use it, their challenges and work with them to overcome them.
To promote someone to management and ensure that the person will succeed, they need to be able to train a salesperson, see how things are going and give continuous feedback so that he can overcome his challenges, one or two things at a time.
That is a coaching approach based entirely on metrics.
If you have a team of 
, a constant volume of leads, and a clear process, your biggest challenge is to help people improve at the points of difficulty in that process.
Observed conversion rates at each stage of the funnel, you can do this.
If a salesperson is great in the first phase of the connection, but not so good at presentation or closing, the manager must work that particular point with him weekly until the performance is corrected.
If another salesperson is excellent at demonstrations and closings but has difficulty connecting with leads, it is important that he be able to develop this skill with the help of his manager.
It is essential to know how to ask the right questions to find the professional’s difficulties.
Besides, listening to leads together and analyzing the cadence of emails helps the person to learn and improve their rates at every stage of the business process.
The use of competitions in sales can help the company as a whole to sell more.
Which seller does not want an additional bonus on stocks or financial? As Hubspot grew, Roberge was able to use these competitions/campaigns to ensure the team upped its performance.
He would make small monthly competitions to solve challenges such as reinforcing desired behaviors, achieving short-term goals and enhancing team integration.
To make a successful sales competition, you need to:
Use mastery competitions, and you will be able to direct your team to the desired goals.
Traditional Role Playing used to be a common sales training tactic. On the other hand, it is challenging to use this interpretation as a training tool because it is difficult to measure its results.
Therefore, Roberge created a Role-Playing model, which has a fixed curriculum, structured and based on real sales situations.
Training included testing, certifications, and helping candidates 
.
These evaluations were passed on to the seller’s manager, who used them to ensure that they focused on opportunities for growth.
That allowed each team member always to know their strengths and also had a clear path to evolve.
At Hubspot, most of the sales innovations came from the team and not from the managers. Ideas began to emerge, and Roberge created a model to ensure that experiments would be sources of learning.
To have a new experiment in progress, it was necessary: To be clear to all what would be success or failure before implementing it; Find the smallest possible investment to take this test without compromising the team’s performance; Select the best possible people to perform the test.
This environment, which is prone to experimentation, has allowed Hubspot to create its channel sales team, which currently accounts for almost 40% of the company’s sales.
In order to have a successful team, it is necessary that the company’s compensation plan is aligned with the objectives of the business.
However, many companies do not evolve their compensation plans as the company grows.
As Hubspot evolved, the compensation plan went through several phases.
Up to the first 1000 customers, the strategy was focused entirely on bringing new customers to the company.
So the compensation plan was based only on closing new customers and did not include retention bonuses.
As the company grew, the plan was adjusted to ensure that the company brought customers and these customers were retained, thus maximizing the value captured by the organization and focusing on the sellers in bringing the right customers.
In this compensation plan, the seller received commissions for being able to better retain the customers he sold, and that made him sell to customers with the most appropriate profile.
Another incentive was to commission more aggressively sellers who were able to receive the value of the annual advance contract and thereby improve the company’s cash flow.

Good to Great Summary,https://blog.12min.com/good-to-great-summary/,,"16 min read ⌚ 
 is a management book that reveals the formula responsible for companies’ success and their transition from average to unwavering financial performance.
Jim Collins is an American business consultant and author. He’s authored six books based on extensive research, including the classic 
.
Collins considers 
 as a prequel to 
, after noticing that leaders followed the principle of ‘Good to Great’. That’s why they built companies that last.
He shows us the processes these great companies went through and, on the other hand, we also witness how companies that did not take that leap failed to maintain steady growth.
“Good to Great Summary”
 identifies eleven great companies and compares them to other similar companies which failed to attain great growth.
Collins introduces new management concepts, such as Level 5 Leaders, the Hedgehog Concept, and the Culture of Discipline, which are essential to the success of good-to-great companies.
 is divided into 9 chapters, which represent the key elements of the book:
Chapter 1 – Good is the Enemy of Great.
Chapter 2 – Level 5 
Chapter 3 – First Who… Then What
Chapter 4 – Confront The Brutal Facts (Yet Never Lose Faith)
Chapter 5 – The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles)
Chapter 6 – A 
Chapter 7 – 
Chapter 8 – The Flywheel and The Doom Loop
Chapter 9 – From Good To Great To Built To Last
Let’s start with the very first chapter, which is organized around the idea of Good vs. Great. It seems that:
According to Jim Collins, most people prefer to settle for good instead of wanting to become great, simply because it’s easier. As long as you don’t want to push your limits, you’ll never discover what you’re truly capable of, and you may never discover your great qualities.
Good is indeed the enemy of most companies. They’re so used to being good that they don’t even try to become great, to excel in their industry.
And this is when other companies take over. Why? Because 
 want to be the best in the industry.
Being the best means that there won’t be any room left for mediocre thinking. Why settle for good when you can become great?
Collins introduces a new concept, Level 5 Leadership. During a five-year study, he and his team noticed that every single great company had the same type of leader.
Modesty and ambition play a great role in the Level 5 leader’s life. All the Level 5 leaders Collins studied were modest.
They never said that company’s success was due to them, but to their employees and good luck.
, they were focused on producing results, doing everything within their power for the greater good of the company, with stoic determination.
, even after they were no longer in charge. They made sure to train their successor, ensuring that the company will survive even after they’ll be long gone.
So how do you recognize a Level 5 leader?
What I liked about this book is the fact that it gives practical advice. It teaches us how to become Level 5 leaders if we’re Level 4 leaders. This is very useful for leaders who wish to become great leaders.
(function(d,id){if(d.getElementById(id))return;var scr=d.createElement(‘script’);scr.src=’https://widget.
.com/v0.2.0/widget.js’;scr.id=id;d.body.appendChild(scr);})(document,’12min-widget-sdk’);window.twelveminInit=function twelveminInit(){};

First Who… Then What is a great way to talk about the people that you want in your life and at work. These Good-to-Great companies followed this principle.
In order to have a successful business, you must decide who you wish to be surrounded by, and which people should no longer be present in your company. Then you can decide the direction in which you’ll be heading.
The Good-to-Great companies first decided which people should be on board and which not.
According to Collins, as long as you have the right people with you, you will be more successful as a company as you won’t waste time and energy motivating people. 
. They know how to do their tasks and they don’t need somebody to push them in the right direction.
Another essential concept that I found in 
 is confronting the most brutal facts of your current reality. It’s something you have to do If you wish to be successful. What does this mean?
You must acknowledge the reality that surrounds you and face the facts.  Be honest. 
, without ever losing hope. Take a look at the companies that are the best in your field, and see if you can overtake them. If you can’t, find something else you can be the best at.
The Hedgehog Concept refers to seeing what is essential and ignoring the rest. All Level 5 Leaders created a Hedgehog concept for their companies. All their decisions were based on simple concepts.
The Hedgehog Concept consists of three overlapping circles, in the form of questions:
What can you be the best in the world at?
What drives your economic engine?
?
In order to succeed, you need all these overlapping circles. It may be a bit uncomfortable to ask yourself what can I be the best at and what I can’t be best at in this world, but it helps in the long run.
This concept can be applied in our everyday life. In order to succeed in any industry, you have to be the best at it, but you also need to be passionate about it, otherwise, you won’t be able to stay on top. If it doesn’t make economic sense, you won’t produce great results.
Discipline is another key element found in all good-to-great companies. As long as you have self-disciplined people, they will do everything possible to accomplish the company’s goal. This may be true, but I believe that nowadays it can be difficult to find 
. Let’s face it, the world is changing rapidly and we tend to lose focus; distractions seem to appear out of nowhere.
Think about the people you work with. Are they disciplined?
Technology Accelerators is new technology that is used by good-to-great companies. These good-to-great companies used new technology within the three circles of the Hedgehog Concept. Technology by itself cannot stimulate performance growth.
The last chapter, “From Good to Great to Built to Last”, tells us that if the advice in 
 is followed we can build something to last. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this book is a prequel to 
.
Care to read it?
The real performance of a company can only be seen over time, when its first leader, the one responsible for its success, is long gone but the company maintains its success. That means that Level 5 leaders have passed on their knowledge in a remarkable way.
 helped me realize that we don’t have to settle for less. We don’t have to be just “good” when we can become “great”.
“Good to Great” is Jim Collins’s bestseller, which builds on the results of a multi-company study and presents countless real-world examples of companies that went from mediocre or even bad to excellent.
The study aimed to answer the following question: Can companies challenge logic and remain excellent over a long period? If so, what are the common characteristics that drive these companies out of mediocrity to success?
To do this, the author analyzed financial data, articles and an extensive corporate information database of 
.
He also conducted hundreds of interviews with executives of these companies and the result, you find here, summarized in this microbook.
In this book, Jim Collins shows us how companies can achieve lasting quality and remain at a level of excellence. Let’s find out the secrets of winning companies?
Confront The Truth About Your Company
Every successful company that has reached success got there by evaluating and accepting their current situation, even if it was a bad one.
Collins found that these companies did not necessarily have very good or bad conditions.
Some were worse, some better, but the successful ones were those who valued and accepted their circumstances.
A great example is a comparison between Kroger and A&P. These 
 faced a change in the market, where consumers wanted bigger and larger stores with a wider variety of products.
Both invested in smaller, more traditional stores that were not compatible with the cravings of new consumers.
But while Kroger accepted this reality and worked to remedy the problem, A&P refused to admit the facts and react.
Kroger changed and replaced each of its stores. The result was a success for Kroger. A&P was stubborn, kept the existing models and quickly stepped out of the top.
For the best strategy to be applied, it is very important 
. And confronting the truth means encouraging honest and open discussions.
Facing the facts can be a very difficult and disheartening process, but if your company creates the right environment to discuss problems and solutions, you can motivate employees to succeed.
Leaders need to be willing to ask questions and promote conversations without monopolizing or refusing to accept contributions. Also, 
 can not point the finger and blame others for problems.
When a problem comes up, make it a priority. If someone has a good suggestion, use it and credit that person for the idea. Find out where the mistake lies, without blaming anyone for it.
But, above all, hold onto the belief that no matter how bad things are, in the end, the company will come to success.
But do not stop there, because optimism without the knowledge of truth only leads to failure.
Keep faith in success, but simultaneously confront the reality of your situation and act accordingly.
This contradiction is called Stockdale’s Paradox and is the key to greatness. You need to have faith that you will achieve success, but also be honest with yourself about the current situation and be willing to take action.
Follow The Hedgehog Concept
The simplest solution to a problem is always the best output. So you need a clear plan to achieve your company goals, and that’s what Jim Collins calls the Hedgehog Concept.
But after all, what is the Hedgehog Concept? It is based on a story of a duel between a fox and a hedgehog.
In this story, the Fox wants to catch the hedgehog. The fox is an intelligent, agile animal that is capable of attacking in several different ways.
On the other hand, the Hedgehog is not recognized for its cleverness. It only knows how to do one thing, very well.
Your only strategy is to become a ball of thorns and roll as fast as possible. Regardless of Fox’s attack, the hedgehog always wins and manages to escape.
More than a strategy, it is an understanding of the situation. 
 know how to do something deeply and focus on it.
Companies that are not made to win tend to act more like the fox. They do many things but lack consistency.
The Collins Hedgehog concept is based on three fundamental ideas that big companies combine to find their way to excellence.
Jim and his researchers found that every company that achieved success followed that concept.
The theory is that any action taken by your company or employees needs to meet all three ideas at once or it will not be successful.
The first idea is that you need to identify your passion. Companies that achieve excellence have a deep knowledge of their passions. Without passion, companies can not get very far.
The second idea is to identify what you can do better than anyone else in the world. Whatever it is, it needs to be the focus of your business. That is the only way to succeed.
Finally, companies must identify how they can profit in the most effective way possible and how to capture more value from their market.
One of the key functions of a business is to generate revenue, and all companies that have achieved excellence were able to identify the best way to capture value in their market.
These companies have discovered how to be economically 
.
To do this, changes need to happen. For example, the Walgreens drugstore chain also owned restaurants. Instead of continuing with both deals, the owners chose to focus on the best investment and left the food service.
The drugstores were a smart economic choice, and CEO Charles R. Cork Walgreen III achieved success.
To work effectively within these three ideas, you must have disciplined employees, and the reward for that is to achieve excellence.
Keep Discipline In Your Organization
Having discipline and using it as a key concept in your company is another essential ingredient to a company’s success.
Discipline does not mean that leaders will lead as dictators. It means that employees at all levels have self-discipline and know what needs to be done and how to do it.
People with self-discipline are more competent and capable, as well as knowing how to keep things going.
A great company is full of people who know how to lead themselves. Each employee is responsible for themselves and their attitudes, and there are no incompetent people who need a nanny.
Disciplined people operate without deviating from the plan and know that following a strategy is the key to success.
Building a sketch based on the three basic principles of the hedgehog concept and giving your employees the freedom and responsibility to work within their boundaries is essential.
Disciplined people will follow the plan and fulfill all of their responsibilities, no matter the circumstances.
Also, leaders will not need to boss their subordinates or discuss their failures. When that happens, you will have reached the disciplined culture in the company, just as all the companies in Collins’s study have achieved to become excellent.
That is one of the common aspects that success stories have.
Disciplined professionals in a company that moves to excellence will be disciplined both about their thoughts and attitudes.
Every thought they have and every decision they make for the company will be exclusive to fulfill the three principles, even if it means failing to seize great opportunities. Following the plan is the goal.
When leaders understand this, they can begin to study 
 and which ones need to be eliminated immediately. If you find behavior that does not work, it needs to be stopped.
Hire The Right People And Fire The Inefficient Ones
For a company to change from good to excellent, it should not only hire the best and most disciplined but also dismiss those who do not agree with the new direction.
Many companies that failed to achieve excellence had inefficient employees in key positions and did not bring the right people to work for their team.
If a company wants to achieve success, it should start by hiring the best and the brightest.
Sometimes there may not be a clear position for them within the company, but it is important to keep them ready for when the goals are well defined.
An example was when Wells Fargo CEO Dick Cooley set up his team.
He was worried about finding the best. He later found positions in the company for them. That is the priority: first to find the best people; What you do with them comes later.
The less successful companies often decide first what to do and then find people – but this fragile system will eventually collapse.
These companies have a single quality leader leading a large number of subordinates who can only receive orders.
If this person leaves the company for some reason, they leave a problem to be solved. That’s exactly what happened when executive Jack Eckerd left Eckerd Corporation.
You must remember that the company 
 and that the wrong people need to be let go.
Do not hire anyone who does not have a place in the company in the future.
Make sure every employee is exactly where he should be and that you put the best where they should be. The right team will work together to find the best path and continue on it.
Use Technology In Your Favor
If your company is going to implement new technology, it must be carefully selected and have a well-defined purpose.
New technologies without a purpose are a waste of time, effort, and money. As we will see below, Walgreens understood this when online pharmacies began to emerge.
So instead of hurrying, they carefully considered a plan of action. Technology is a tool used by large companies to get organizations to achieve their goals.
If technology does not fit the three basic principles of the Hedgehog Concept, then it should not be used, no matter how popular it may be in the industry.
New technologies do not create organizational movements or success, but rather help develop what already exists, and then have a clear role in the company’s action plan.
As mentioned before, Walgreens was not sure 
, so they did not rush to use it.
Instead, they conducted experiments first to understand how it worked and only then began to use it, promoting convenience, as with filling in online revenue.
Finally, after studying and having a clear idea of how a site would help in its goals, Walgreens became a 100% online pharmacy, achieving success.
Meanwhile, other online pharmacies failed quickly and paved the way for Walgreens.
A company that achieves excellence will not be pressured into using any technology.
Instead,  carefully consider how it should be used and 
 the chance to think of innovative strategies that will differentiate the company from their competitors and help the company achieve its goals.
A mediocre company will immediately use new technologies for no purpose, afraid of becoming outdated.
Have Humble Hardworking Leaders
Collins and his team hoped to discover that the most charismatic and famous executives would be the ones who brought their companies to excellence, but in fact, the most effective leaders were modest and reserved.
Through articles and personal interviews with those involved, they found that the 
 were humble and worked hard.
His research team found that every great company possessed an exceptional leader during the periods of transition to excellence.
Exceptional leaders are not egocentric as the leaders of mediocre businesses. An exceptional leader cares only about the company’s success, even if it does not receive credit for it.
They do not want the company to fail when they leave, and they do worry about having excellent succession plans for when their exit happens.
They seem calm because of their more reserved nature, but they also have professional ambitions.
But these ambitions are directed to the company and not to themselves.
These leaders will do everything for the success of the company, no matter how difficult.
For them, the goal is to train other leaders to achieve even greater success, even if it leaves them overshadowed by their successors.
Choosing a shallow leader for the company is a mistake many mediocre businesses make, as was Scott Paper with Al Dunlap.
He shouted about his accomplishments, but his company was then bought by 
 Darwin Smith of Kimberly-Clark.
A great leader should be a great collaborator and not an exhibitionist.
Exceptional leaders see potential everywhere. A median leader can become exceptional by learning to take responsibility for his mistakes and to credit the company and people with the right answers.
Exceptional leaders look to others when things work out and give recognition to their teams. Mediocre leaders do the opposite and like to appear.
Always Follow The Principles of The Hedgehog Concept
Only a select number of companies achieve success, and an even smaller number remain in a state of excellence.
The trick is to keep the formula for excellence as business conditions change over the years.
Collins calls the methods he discovered in his research of “physics” that remains over the years to generate the shift from ‘good’ to ‘excellent’.
No matter how much the economy and market change, these methods can be applied to achieve and maintain excellence.
The process comes down to always having the best people possible in the right places and maintaining a constant conversation about the state of affairs, including areas that need improvement.
By honestly admitting where the failures are, a company begins to improve and prevent disasters.
By maintaining discipline in following the principles of the Hedgehog Concept chosen for your company and achieving and redefining your goals over time, you can remain in the state of excellence.
Succeed in Your Company
Studying various data, Collins and his team found impressive results.
But the fact is that the process by which these companies went on to achieve success took years of dedicated and disciplined work and each employee 
.
The results can be fantastic, but the road to get there is long.
Companies go through a gradual development until they reach excellence and there is no way to define when this process is over.
One day the company will realize that it has achieved its goals and that it has 
.
The fact is it does not happen quickly, and companies that never achieve excellence often try to accelerate the path to success with poor results.
Combining two mediocre businesses into one acquisition will not generate an excellent company. It will only create more of the same, and sometimes it can even make things worse.
Usually, a successful company does not make big acquisitions until it has changed from ‘good’ to ‘excellent’.
Excellent companies follow a pattern, while good ones inevitably follow another pattern.
Collins calls this the great pendulum pattern, which leads the organization to advance until it reaches the ideal point.
The mediocre pattern is a cycle that does not care about the company’s necessary development and fails to reach the ideal point.
You can not rush to perfection. Skipping important steps leads to failure. Only time and effort lead to excellence.

Final Notes:
You need great, humble, committed, and disciplined leaders in every position of your company to make your transition to excellence.
These people, driven by the company’s goals, can work together on the three principles of the Hedgehog Concept.
A company that is honest about its current state and believes it will succeed will achieve success. Therefore, every employee, especially the company leader, must put the goals and interests of the company above their own."

“Will it Fly? PDF Summary”
It’s common to interrogate children about their dream job when they grew up. The answers are common, too: firefighter, policeman, doctor, and so on. But if we were to ask them later on in their early adulthood, I’m sure their answer would be Richard Branson.
Many of us adults see just the glamorous side of a 
: private island, private jet, exotic travels. We might not want to deal a business of this size, but are we willing to put in the effort and work for a smaller one? Now we have a very good opportunity to find out.
Entrepreneurship is the future of the economy. Books, blogs, podcasts, and presentations all teach how what, and for who to start a business. Patrick Flynn is a successful businessman, with many achievements to his name.
He’s a speaker, a podcaster with famous guests, a website owner, and now the author of 
. His expertise is mainly counseling for online businesses.
FULFILLED IDEAS / WILL IT FLY?
And because business is the future, we must learn how to do it.
There is a saying, always take advice from those who succeeded. We need to follow in the right footsteps.
 teaches us test our next business idea so we don’t waste time and money. Pat Flynn’s book is a technical, meticulous piece on how to construct a successful business from an idea.
Flynn is driven by data; his phrases are short, straightforward, and his book has many resource materials.
It’s easy to say “let’s get rich”. But how we get started?
To thrive in a business, we must work hard. It’s a long road from an idea to the business itself. We must begin with a plan that gives us direction, that shows us what – and who – is important to us: family, job, health?
Things that are important to us can help map that road, our idea, and how to put it into practice. Herein lies the key to success.
But what makes 
stand out from its many, many peers?
It’s filled with shared secrets, tips, and valuable information that wasn’t previously revealed to the business-avid public. Flynn’s approach is different, deeper, more human. Until now business was all about marketing, selling the product, and counting the income.
Flynn warns that there are other important aspects to consider if we want to have a functional business. Like having a more human approach towards your customers: knowing very well what they want, and being fair to them if the product doesn’t make them happy.
The values we learn from 
will help us be successful. After all, it’s value that sells.
It starts by making a so-called mind map; to how to identify clients; how to put the products on the market or to collect pre-orders. Pat Flynn’s

The first chapter, “

These specialists were former guests on Flynn’s podcast. Every effort is made to give the reader 
.
We learn from the book, we listen to all the council. But is this enough to reach for the stars?
Knowledge on its own won’t help us communicate and adjust our leadership style when conducting our team.
Pat Flynn’s 
 explains why we must be prepared for these challenges – after all, we’re going to work with people, not just numbers. Building a close relationship with customers is a high priority for a successful business.
Also, in Flynn’s opinion, a businessman must know:
Bottom line: the future consists of personal development and private businesses. But we must give the clients exactly what they want. And we can’t be selfish. Aiming to get rich fast won’t work in the long run.
Even if we won’t have the result we want, the experience itself is priceless. As psychology states, there are character traits and skills that are developed only through resilience.
Putting ourselves through that process can offer us 
 and, in the end, we’ll know ourselves much better.

The Goal Summary,https://blog.12min.com/the-goal-summary/,,"9 min read ⌚ 
: 
Delays in production, declines in revenue, and other problems that companies face are gradually resolved in this management parable.
Also, the fundamental concepts of the Theory of Constraints have been popularized by this work.
In this microbook, you will learn how to overcome the bottlenecks of your company and put into practice a process of continuous improvement. Let’s go?
The Goal Summary
Eliyahu M. Goldratt was a physics student in Israel in the 1970s. There he developed a mathematical theory for industries to plan their production optimally. The theory became known as OPT (Optimized Production Technology).
After completing his studies, Goldratt devoted himself to putting his theory into practice in the marketplace in real companies, and in the 1980s he expanded this theory by formulating the so-called Restriction Theory.
The theory of constraints reveals that in order to maximize a firm’s productive capacity, it is necessary to create mechanisms that assess how production line decisions affect profits.
Not always the volume of profits of a company is directly associated with its efficiency.
Being productive means being closer to the expected result of the goal. Any action that brings the company closer to its goal is therefore productive. To measure a company’s performance, you need to use financial metrics.
The Company Goal
A for-profit company should seek present and 
. Unlike previous thought currents, Goldratt believes that profitability does not conflict with the company’s mission and vision.
Profitability ensures that the company can grow and become sustainable to stay in the market and that is what enables the company’s mission to be realized.
The survival of a company derives from its ability to generate value and profits and this is done when its products and services 
.
Consumer needs for quality and functionality need to be met for the company to continue growing.
Welcome To The Unique Manufacturing World
Alex Rogo is the manager of a UniCo manufacturing plant. Its factory is running the risk of being closed by the UniCo directors. The factory is failing to deliver the products consumers want, and this brings permanent losses.
Production is lagging behind, employees are trying to catch up by working overtime, and 
. Combined delays, worn out employees and overtime cost prevent the factory from generating money.
Without alternatives, Rogo seeks outside help. He hires a consultant named Jonah, to find improvement opportunities and save the factory.
Playing Catch Up
As the manufacturing and customer orders delivery is late, Jonah needs to reduce the time between the order made by a customer and the delivery of the product.
To reduce this time, called lead time, from a few months to a few weeks, Jonah goes on to try to understand what may be stopping the factory from becoming profitable.
He realizes that although the factory is not generating money, it has teams that 
.
Teams that had independent goals and were responsible for some steps in the process were succeeding.
Because teams work together in the factory, a high-productivity team that hits the finish line at the right cost and ends up generating more inputs for other teams, which ended up stopping the manufacturing process.
That makes it clear to Rogo and Jonah that the high productivity of a team is not necessarily a good thing for the plant as a whole.
The integration of the teams functions as a pipeline where a constant flow of activities occurs. If a team cannot keep up with another team’s performance, it becomes a bottleneck for the company and this pipeline flow capacity decreases.
Products stand still in the middle of the process, the inventory grows unnecessarily, and resources invested by the company come to a standstill. Rogo’s factory, for example, bought raw materials at high speed to keep up with the first team.
However, the company was unable to deliver the products because many incomplete products would stand still after the first stage completion.
Two Types Of Resources
There are 2 types of resources in a factory:
Alex Rogo implemented a change by understanding the two types of resources. The company’s processes need to be aligned with 
 of generating profits, and the teams need to change focus.
When the highly productive team delivers more than the production line can absorb, resources stand idle, and the company’s overall goal is undermined.
 
    (function(d,id){

      if(d.getElementById(id))return;

      var scr=d.createElement('script');scr.src='https://widget.
.com/v0.2.0/widget.js';scr.id=id;d.body.appendChild(scr);})(document,'12min-widget-sdk');

    
So the first task is to identify the company goal (make the plant profitable) and have all teams work toward the same goal.
If a team does a local performance optimization and this goal does not help the company achieve its goal, this is not a positive optimization.
Company Goal Components
Together, Jonah, Alex, and his team set out to identify how to improve their production process. To reach the financial goal, they discovered that there are 3 tasks to be accomplished:
By acting on these 3 components, the factory could then reach profitability and the indicator to be tracked is net profit. It is measured by the difference between earnings, defined as sales revenues less operating expenses and inventory costs.
Net income reflects how much money the company is generating at any given time.
Another important indicator of being monitored is the 
. It exists to measure the effort required to achieve predefined profitability.
To know your return on investment, you must divide the net profit by the inventory, that is, all the money that the company invests in the purchase of things that it intends to sell.
Identifying Bottlenecks
Alex Rogo and Jonah then left to identify the company bottlenecks, the stages of the production line where the process stopped.
Once there are 2 teams causing bottlenecks, they impact the entire factory to produce at the slower bottleneck speed.
Thus, employees would only work if it was possible to deliver the product to the customer at the factory speed. When work generates inputs that are not going to be used, what actually occurs is a waste and is not advantageous to the company.
By optimizing the factory bottleneck processes, they realized that it was not necessary to focus on the processes that worked.
If the 
 is on the bottleneck, it’s easy to increase factory productivity. Any effort in non-mitigating processes did not produce results.
These teams did not need the pressure, overtime or 
, after all, any gain about them did not help the company’s performance.
Even the purchase of computers and robots to improve processes without bottlenecks was useless and mere waste.
Market’s Bottleneck
With factory speed improving, the team can deliver products to the market in a timely manner. On the other hand, a new problem arises.
There is not so much demand to buy the products created by the factory’s high production capacity.
When capacity is greater than demand, problems arise. Ready-made products get stuck in inventory, and that means stationary money, which detracts from the goal.
That’s why Alex’s new priority is to align factory capacity with market demands.
The factory needs to be pulled from the market so that what it produces costs as little as possible to generate more gains. When the process is pulled from the market, there is no waste.
Adopting Continuous Improvement
To stay competitive, UniCo needs to reduce lead time, costs to deliver the product and thus ensure that the plant is profitable.
The easiest way to keep the plant efficiency is adopting a method of continuous improvement so that as time goes by the factory becomes 
.
The process of continuous improvement consists of 5 main steps:
Through continuous improvement, Alex and his team can reduce lead time, reduce costs and prove their method to top management so they can save the plant.
This turnaround allowed Rogo, previously tired and stressed, to be promoted and invited to apply his apprenticeships in all UniCo factories.

The Goal Quotes
Final Notes
In a company, it is important that work is organized to identify bottlenecks. Once identified, we must focus entirely on solving it and even adjusting other processes to operate according to their capacity.
All this can be achieved through a process of continuous improvement, always monitored and optimized to align the company more and more with the market demand."

This summary covers the inevitable rise of a person, who is no different than you. After a certain amount of time passes, Tony hopes that you will be his greatest success.
The author includes a step-by-step plan that will help you identify which emotions are empowering. According to Tony Robbins, everything that we do is related to our state of mind, the way we feel, and our emotions.
Everything we do should be directed towards our enjoyment, to our well-being. It’s only natural, don’t you think so?
In the first chapter, “Dreams of Destiny”, Robbins reminds us that we all had a dream at one point in our lives. But due to a number of reasons, we seem to have forgotten all about it.
In order to accomplish our dreams, we need to change. This concept of change is essential to anyone who wants to improve the quality of their life. But what do we have to do?
Take a look at these steps provided by Tony Robbins in 
:
1. Raise your standards.
2. 
.
3. Change your strategy.
Curious to find out more? If so, it’s definitely worth reading the entire book!
Chapter 2, “Decisions: The Pathway to Power”, emphasizes the importance of decisions. Robbins indicates that decisions design our lives, and I agree with him. In order to 
, he recommends making more and more decisions. This way, we will learn from them.
The third chapter, entitled “The Force That Shapes Your Life”, talks about emotions, sensations that we link to our thoughts. These will either give us a sense of pain or a sense of pleasure.
Which emotions are empowering to you? The ones that create pleasure or the ones that create pain? Think about it!
The main concept of 
 can found in the fourth chapter, “Belief Systems: The Power to Create and the Power to Destroy”. Robbins talks about two types of belief systems: limiting belief systems and empowering belief systems.
In order to eliminate the limiting belief system, we need to link massive pain to the old belief.
We need to convince our brain that if we continue this way, we will inflict massive pain. So, if we associate pleasure with the new belief, we’ll feel great about adopting the new empowering belief system.
In chapter 6, Robbins introduces a new concept: conditioning. It seems that once we adopt change, it’s difficult to maintain it in the long run. So he suggests 
, over and over again.
It may be easy to quit smoking, but it’s more difficult to never smoke again because each time you face a stressful moment you’ll have to urge to light a cigarette.
Chapter 7 includes the major questions we need to ask ourselves in order to get what we want:
Chapter 8 is about questions and answers. It seems that asking good questions leads to a good life. But what happens when you keep asking the same questions and still 
? Robbins tells us that we simply need to change our 
.
That seems easy, right?
Chapter 9 and 10 are related to the “Vocabulary of Ultimate Success”, thus including metaphors.
The vocabulary that we use influences the way we think, feel, and live. I couldn’t believe it myself until I continued reading this book. It does seem to be true that we think of the words we use when we’re in an argument.
If we use words that make us feel powerful, we will feel powerful, like we can win an argument, thus avoiding pain.
In the next chapter, Robbins sets apart 4 types of goals and ways to achieve them:
Chapter 13, “The Ten-Day Mental Challenge”, includes a recipe for success. As you’ll notice from the title, Robbins recommends taking a ten-day mental diet. This means that you eliminate all negative thoughts and any stress that is part of your life.
A new concept, found in chapter 14, is the “Master System” and its ultimate influence.

In the following chapter, Tony Robbins emphasizes the importance of values, because they are seen as our personal compass. They guide our decisions and thus, our destiny.


In order to check whether your values help you improve the quality of your life, Robbins suggests doing the following:
In chapter 17, Robbins emphasizes the importance of references in the fabric of life.
The more references you have, the more chances of you succeeding, as you have many choices available. Make as many choices as you need to, to find the right one.
Chapter 18 is about discovering our true identity. You can do this by following this plan:
The third part of

Key Lessons from “Awaken the Giant Within”
The real power of a proper decision-making mentality
Everything that occurs in every person’s life starts with determination and dedication.
A right decision is the one able to generate a complete sense of satisfaction. This approach indicates a suitable shift in focus, precisely understanding true values in life and developing a long-term plan of activities to achieve the desired outcome.
For the same reason a person has to apply these six vital tactics in life to achieve success:
Physiology and Psychology are interdependent terms
As humans, we have countless emotional states. However, their occurrence will always remain a mystery. For a person to increase its chances of attaining personal success, it has to embrace the original and beneficial states.
Although is easier said than done – a complete transformation on an emotional level is possible, all you need is a shift in focus.
When you think about it, you’ll see that emotions are not separate entities; they are also linked to physiology or the body language.

Quotes
Our Critical Review
If you follow the principles presented in Robbins’s book, you will have the tools to ensure your emotional, physical, relationship and financial destiny.
Make a Decision And Commit. Focus Is Everything
Many people know what they should do to succeed in life, but few go ahead and do what it takes.
To improve your quality of life, you need to master your emotions, your physical state, your personal and professional relationships, your money, and your time.
To take the reins of your life, you have to work hard. Your goal is to understand how the decisions you make in your day-to-day work and then take control of them.
A decision always precedes an action. Therefore, to achieve the desired results, you need to observe the decisions you have made and continue to make in your life. Incredibly, external conditions have little influence on their accomplishments.
Anyone can achieve just about anything she/he wants. Just decide and commit to your goals. Just awaken your giant within.
It is important for you to know: a decision is not a synonym of hope. It is not something that you decide on and expect to happen. Choosing means focusing; when making a decision, you must get rid of all the other possibilities and focus on just one outcome. Focus on what is important because you will become what you pursue.
Human beings seek to avoid pain and gain pleasure. We act consciously or unconsciously to do what we believe will please us or avoid suffering.
To make winning decisions, you need to amplify pain or pleasure.
You have to condition your mind to exaggerate the pleasure of doing something good and the pain of doing something wrong. You need to create mental associations between your goals and your feelings of pain and pleasure. With these emotional connections, you become capable of changing your behavior.
Associate your bad habits with things that cause you pain and associate healthy habits with things that will please you in the future. By creating this type of association, it is easy for your body to give up addictions and encourage healthy habits.
We act by believing that in the future something will bring us pain or pleasure. We need to understand this association to become winners.
Our understanding of things that happen in our lives has a significant impact on who we are now and who we will be in the future. It is significantly affected by the things we believe in, our thoughts.
Understanding our beliefs is the key to creating different visions of the same event in our lives. Most ideas come from past experiences that have brought us pain or pleasure. They are personal interpretations of the results of any event in our lives and exert significant influence on our future actions.
Our brain is not always able to distinguish between imagination and physical experience because beliefs affect our perception. Therefore, it is necessary to work on the creation of our beliefs. To evolve as people, we need to work on changing our expectations.
The process to change an opinion is simple. First, mentally associate an old idea with pain. Think of a bad habit you have and visualize a mental image of something that causes you pain. Then project a new feeling and associate it with something that pleases you.
Your goal should be a continuous improvement (in Japanese, kaizen). We should always seek to evolve and improve our beliefs.
Constant and endless improvement should be a commitment reinforced by the attitude of continuing to improve gradually. This work will develop your confidence, from a steady and consistent effort, to know that, every day, you become a better person.
Neuro-Associative Conditioning (NAC) is a process that associates intense desires with anything you wish to adopt and associates unbearable pain with anything you want to avoid.
Although most people believe that changing old habits for new ones can take a lot of time, behavior patterns can change quickly and permanently. Conditioning yourself in the right way will enable you to bring about immediate change.
To recondition yourself, you need to follow six simple steps:
There is a direct connection between what a person wants to achieve in life and what they want to feel. Material possessions and personal relationships are simply a means to an end; they are a way to achieve desired emotional states.
Your behavior is the direct result of your current emotional state. Therefore, by changing your current emotional state, you can change your behavioral patterns and thus achieve the desired goals.
There are two ways to change your emotional state.
The first one says that impulse creates emotion. If you want to feel a particular emotion, start acting as if you already felt that way. The second one says that your focus becomes your perception of reality. So if your focus is on things that have not yet happened and you already feel good about them, you create a conducive environment for them to happen.
Make a list of the activities you want to reinforce and create methods to focus on these activities most of the time.
Words can create emotions that shape our destiny. Beliefs are shaped and changed by the words we speak. Therefore, the words you use in your daily life affect not only how you communicate, but also how you perceive the world and how you behave.
By changing your vocabulary, you change your thoughts and habits. Consciously choose the words you use in your day-to-day life, and you can change your life and your destiny. Use words that empower and scratch those which are counterproductive. Check out some tips:
Another important point is that the metaphors you use can stimulate or limit your life. When you use a metaphor constantly, you automatically begin to assimilate its advantages and limitations. Choose your metaphors carefully.
You use a metaphor whenever you explain a principle in comparison to something else. Metaphors are a way of learning. They provide a way to visualize unfamiliar concepts in familiar terms. By consciously using them, you can influence and shape your life experiences.
To transform your life, you have to understand that each person creates their feelings, which are valuable resources.
The most powerful emotions you can create are love, gratitude, curiosity, enthusiasm, determination, flexibility, confidence and joy.
To master your emotions and transform yourself, you need to be able to create these positive feelings. Some tips to create this type of emotion are:
Every person has the power to create their promising future. However, it is necessary to be clear about the goals and purposes sought. To reach this bright future, therefore, one must know how to define their targets and objectives. To create a goal, follow this plan:
First, your goal should be clear, straightforward, and generous in detail. Second, every goal must have a clear plan associated with it. This plan should have activities, dates, and everything that needs to happen for you to get there. Finally, you need to visualize this goal. Twice a day at least, stop and think about your goal, your plan, and get ideas on how to reach it faster.
It is also important to focus on the journey and not just the goal. Achieving your goals is important, but enjoying the ride is much more, and it’s what keeps you moving in the right direction.
Take control of your thoughts and refuse to fight any bad emotion. Create a 10-day positivity plan and transform your life.
You need to know that your current operating system, your way of thinking, has led you to your present accomplishments. To move to new levels, you need to change the operating system. Follow the following method for this:
If you want to modify anything in your life, you must change the way you act. Changing how you feel about the things that happen in your life is much more powerful because it will automatically change your way of acting. So you have to understand the five elements that affect your feelings:
Changing these five elements, or even just one of them, completely changes your way of thinking, feeling, and behaving.
Your values guide all your decisions and are responsible for your future achievements. You must create a system of positive values to achieve lasting happiness.
One mistake many people make is to spend a lot of time worrying about what they want to have in the future when, in fact, they should focus on how they are spending their lives now. Values can be both negative and positive. They may be things you want to foster or things you want to avoid.
However, it is important to be careful. Many people create limiting rules for their lives and end up delaying achievements.
It is important to build positive rules, focusing on the things you can control, not the random events of life. This discernment ensures that you control your destiny.
A person’s beliefs and values are selected through references, which are the personal experiences or experiences of others that one hears or sees in the media. The greater the number and quality of referrals a person has, the more he or she can make meaningful decisions in his or her life.
To expand the quality of your life, make consistent and conscious efforts to develop the references that impact you. Reading, for example, is an excellent way to expand your references.
Be it in right or wrong situations, your feelings about it is based on the references used. You need to be able to learn from the past, but you can not live in it. No one drives a car constantly looking in the rearview mirror, which should only be used in some maneuvers.
Grow your references circle, and you will create a new identity. New ideas and influences will not come out of anywhere. It takes a true effort to expand the limits of your mind.
Your identity comes from the beliefs you use to define your individuality. You are what you believe makes you unique.
Many people believe that their identities were shaped exclusively by their experiences. Even so, two people can go through the same experience and have entirely different memories and attitudes. More than a person’s skills, their interpretation, through a system of beliefs and values, is far more influential in the formation of an identity than the experience itself.
So before you start shaping an identity, take time to think about where you are now. The steps to creating a powerful new character are:
Forget about the past and worry about the quality of your life in the present. Work to have an even better life in the future by accepting rather than avoiding change. Make conscious and rational efforts to develop a robust and dynamic identity.
Final Notes:
Make sure you live your life to the fullest. Try everything and have fun. Enjoy the process as well as the destination. Combine the spontaneity of youth with the wisdom of experience, and keep growing and learning. Live each day as if it were the most important day of your life because it is.
Each small decisions you make, define your destiny. Therefore, if a person controls how he or she feels, thinks and acts, they control their destiny, regardless of the external conditions that exist.
Finally, it is essential that you seek a balanced life instead of pursuing perfection. Life is a balance between giving and receiving, caring for one’s interests and contributing to the well-being of others."

It was hard to summarize a book that literally abounds with insights, quotes, strategies, and knowledge.
As the name implies, you’ll get introduced to the greatest writings and secrets of the wealthiest and how you can get there.
This book or let’s say a collection of insights is a blessing in disguise for those of you who want to reach new heights and explore new depths.
Without further ado, let’s dig in.
Who Should Read “The Prosperity Bible”? And Why?
Despite the fact that we believe this “
” has all the hallmarks of a great broad-range classic – it’s suited only for those who are fed up with the mediocre life.
If you lust for more influence and prosperity, then this definitely should be your go-to guide.
About Napoleon Hill
 is well-known around the world and hailed for his discoveries and inquiries in the realm of self-help and personal development.
Regarded as the founding father of this 20
-century self-help philosophy, he excelled as an author and entrepreneur in some sense.
It’s also critical to mention the books he wrote, which brought about a revolution in the world: 
“The Prosperity Bible PDF Summary”
The science behind getting rich has been on everyone’s lips since the beginning of time.
Before we go any further, it’s vital to point out that there is nothing wrong in wanting to improve your financial status. Some people get castigated for being too ambitious, but the craving for a more abundant, flamboyant lifestyle is by all means, admirable.
As an addition to that, one can clearly see that life is nothing but a battleground for the mind, soul, and body. You must address their needs, in order to create this perfect synergy or circle in which none is better than the other.
When it comes to the formula, there are some laws which if followed could facilitate the transition from rags to riches.
Funny thing about rich people is that upon diving into the subject, Napoleon discovered that they are just about as casual as you are. This literally stigmatizes the popular opinion that rich people are gifted and have to do very little to accrue wealth.
It all requires more than a steady stream of income or assets – but that’s a story for another day.
For a person to get to a position of power and prosperity, it must acknowledge the fact that the real battle unfolds from within. Creation or intuitiveness is by all accounts an essential asset in building this inner aura.
If the principles you espouse and deem legit provide you with enough room to exhibit your talents, then you are on the right path.
If you like to take the fast-track to success, Napoleon advises you to undergo a shift in perception.
So, here how it works.
Every time a stream of thoughts pops up telling you are not worth it, you need to neglect them and focus on a positive outcome. In all honesty, this is no picnic, and it’s regarded as an uphill battle by every stretch of the imagination.
To counter this, the universal energy or thought radiates an unconfined sense of creativity, which if embraced fully could shore up your business and activities.
If you lean on the Universal law, bad thoughts will not become a distant memory, but they will lose their grip. 
Remember that life is from within outward, not vice versa, which means you’re the wielder of power.
There’s one rule that Napoleon believes to be noteworthy and it goes like this:
If by some stretch of the imagination you decide to bring more value to people on the receiving end, and cash-in later – you’ll be much more pleased with the results. In other words, if you have people working for you; it’s imperative for you to absorb more in cash value than you actually pay them in wages.
Last but not least, let’s unpack the much-talked-about phenomenon – Formless Substance. 
As the name vaguely implies, it’s a downright process, that rarely happens in front of your eyes.
It’s designed to absorb the creativity that permeates the environment and adjusts according to time and circumstances. 
Some companies and organizations, find it very challenging to excel under the umbrella of the Formless Intelligence. 
And it’s even harder to conduct this process in a harmonious manner. 
To make sure that the rope is not overly stretched, one must go through some basic ground rules.
Before we dive into that, let’s just say that all of it can be summed up in one word – gratitude.
It’s needless to say that the more grateful you feel, that more likely it is for you to find the harmonious undertone.
When it comes to getting rich, it is a must for you to get into the right frame of mind.
Everyone has desires, so pulling that off will not suffice.
In the magnetic field of energies, one must take hold of the needle of the compass and direct it towards a goal-specific mental plan.
Now, let’s go back and find out a bit more about the harmonious way of dealing with things:
Lessons that lead-up prosperity
 – 
If you look up and down, you’ll find that the divine mind is the absolute truth. When a person is courageous enough to embrace that kind of ideas into its mind, an incredible force emerges and strengthens your position in the world.
 – 
It’s clear as day, that there’s no such thing as an impossible endeavor, in the providence of God. To put it simply, desire is the living reflection of the Universal impulse. 
 – 
Over the course of thousands of years, people have developed faith and trust towards the unseen that cannot be grasped through the senses. 
It’s a state of mind, that prompts us to envision a much brighter outcome, than the one presented before us.
Apart from the lessons, there are other instances where prosperity is and should be scrutinized.
First off, you have to accept the relative reality, and then you are given the go-ahead to do the drilling.
Your judgment is predicated upon your view of the world and your surroundings. Therefore, it’s impossible to ascertain which side is more realistic, because our mind determines our reality.
If your mindset is predominantly tilted towards optimism, you’ll do much better in life.
That’s not rocket science and has been proven over and over again.
Even the secret of success revolves around optimism, and mindset above all else.
The truth is – with so many active discussions going on regarding success, it’s difficult to separate the actionable from the inaccurate.
Truthfully, only a small number of people are eligible to give advice – Napoleon is one of them. Practically, only the people who put the accent on individuality and reject the collective blame could eventually flourish in the market of ideas.
Bear in mind that the mere nurturing of dormant and latent Individuality makes it harder to express oneself or exhibit positive behavior. 
On top of that, when our lucrative careers are on the line, people find it hard to lead the flock and rise to the occasion.
As you can see, the formula around prosperity always revolves or leans on a person’s competence. 
And sustaining and advocating for free expression on behalf of the individual is what lies at the end of the battle.
Basically, this is the primary ingredient that enables success and prompts productive discourse.
It’s no wonder why society glorifies people in all walks of life who have achieved extraordinary results in their sphere of knowledge. However, as people, we tend to live by the excuse that these brilliant individuals had a flair while we weren’t born that lucky.
As a response to the misleading reality, Napoleon Hill takes sides with those whose Interest and Desires are manifested in action. 
Enthusiasm is also among the things that usually predicts success in the workplace.
If you add time to all of these elements, you pretty much get the accurate picture on how to achieve success and prosperity.
If we take the whole human history and existence into consideration, it’s pretty obvious that the ultimate goal is growth and evolution. Life is dynamic in every shape and form, and one cannot put it in a static mode, even at will.
Stagnation is the ultimate sin and a paradox that cannot be accomplished, ever.
Even if you decide not to do anything, growth and development will still take place.
When it comes to prosperity, the feeling or the impetus for acquiring knowledge is the reason behind every action. Knowing that in order to earn respect, you have to undertake certain types of activities is both liberating and frightening to those who might get the short end of the stick.
In this case, resorting to pressure and fear will do you no good.
The mere notion of rejecting personal responsibility for your actions is by all accounts the worst-case scenario.
With that in mind, one must bring its ingenuity into line with the know-how acquired during a certain period of time, in order to overcome the hurdles down the way. For instance, an athlete gets ready for their matchday by going to the gym or on the pitch and doing all sorts of exercises.
Physical and mental training is needed in times of crisis or when you are compelled to play by someone else’s rules. 
Anyways, in moments of stress and excitement, one must put its emotions aside and act reasonably.
In the end, our actions and mindset will determine whether we are up for the challenge.
Last but not least, Napoleon tries to divulge enough information about the impact of the subconscious mind and how it affects our lives.
In his words, the subconscious elements mainly reflect the desires of the heart, not those of the mind.
So, it would be imprudent to neglect its influence over our lives especially due to the fact that the subconsciousness is triggered without command or decision. 
Key Lessons from “The Prosperity Bible”
1.      Prosperity doesn’t come absent cost
2.      Growth is what you should aim for
3.      It’s all about keeping up the pace
Prosperity doesn’t come absent cost
It would be foolish enough to believe that attaining stature in society is one of those things that can be regarded straightforward.
The truth is, you have to sacrifice some things on your part, in order to climb up the ladder of prosperity.
Growth is what you should aim for
At this point, it is vital that you push and allocate time and energy to obtain more knowledge and not merely work for money.
Growth is the only thing you should truly care about in order to ensure prosperity on the long haul.
It’s all about keeping up the pace
Once you begin to work on yourself, there’s no stopping or taking a break.
It’s beyond doubt that you will have troubles to overcome, and issues to solve but that mustn’t be used as an excuse.

For its drafting Tony “interviewed more than 50 self-made billionaires” who managed to successfully confront and “to dominate the markets decade after decade”.
“Money Master The Game Summary”
What’s the purpose of this book? To bring to the forefront “the best possible information from the most knowledgeable and influential experts in the world”.
The book is divided into seven chapters. And each chapter represents one step on the road to Financial Freedom. An easy path to take, as the author says. A path that can be crossed by every human being, regardless of their professional background.
This is why he sees this book as a gesture of goodness for all those people who couldn’t access the information and the secrets of this mighty capital market.
 to financial security is very simple and can be taken by everyone. As 
 says, if someone wants to make a big change in his life, 
This could be very useful for everybody who wants to make some investment in the future. Life is like a chess game and its main pawn is represented by the money. Depending on how you use the money you can win or lose this game.

This section brings to the front line 
 that could make the difference if you pay attention and detect them. If you don’t, “they will systematically destroy your financial future.”
Wall Street is like a jungle and this was said by one of the most successful men in the game, that already had mastered the game.
That’s why the author urges us to study every day, every second of your life and to pay maximum attention if you want to

.
Now you know what you have to do -Tony prepared some advice for you to speed up your moment of action.
The main idea is: 
This kind of advice is not only for those who want to invest. They are perfect for those who want to save more too.
The next three steps are a deepening the 
 
They provide useful advice from those who succeeded to tame the Wall Street jungle; examples of people who have succeeded – and their example will motivate you; ideas about how you could make a balance between risk and income; how you should calculate your investments and how to apply tax to get the maximum possible profits for life.
The first step is the main and simplest of all. Determine how much you want to invest and save.
Independence and financial freedom begin there. Although simple, though, the decision can cause a sense of loss, of lifestyle loss.
The feeling of “if I save money, I will not live too” is real, but it should not be decisive when choosing how much to keep and invest.
It is important to think that in the next 25 or 30 years the human life expectancy may exceed 100 years. If financial life is hard now, imagine having to plan to save money and retire with all that time ahead.
It is for information like life expectancy that planning should begin as soon as possible.
And another important point is not to depend on or expect too much from traditional retirement. Retirements, as we know them today, may not even exist in the not too distant future.
It is not to despair and to think that it will be necessary to work until you die. The important thing is to wake up to reality and rethink some of the myths that have always been told about financial security throughout life, such as:
If you believe working for 40 years will guarantee your financial freedom for another 40 years, it’s time to think better about what you believe.
The return of a traditional retirement is not worth from the investment point of view. It impoverishes you over time. So, briefly, the lesson is:
Your future is in your hands.

Like it or not, you need to economize and invest your money aggressively. Is this a fun mission?
No. Sexy? Even less. You would probably like to buy a wonderful house, a new car and sport a lifestyle out there. But this is not the way to long-term success.
Saving and investing aggressively is not cool, fun or sexy, but it helps you sleep more peaceful evenings. You owe it to yourself and your family. It’s a matter of protection to try to prepare for eventual storms throughout life.
Think of the investment market, pensions, and social security plans as a game. As a strategy game, you need to know how to use the right cards, make the most assertive moves, and plan your victory well.
The top tips to feel more prepared and properly safe before even entering the investment world:
True financial success comes in levels. In 5 levels, to be more exact:
To follow this path you need to decide what stage of it you intend to reach.
Some people seek an extremely luxurious life, which is a perfectly normal desire. Others, however, prefer a simple yet comfortable life.
None of the alternatives is certain since the concept of right and wrong is not applicable in such cases. It is only your decision.
Regardless of the level of financial success you desire, 5 strategies will guide the process and accelerate your personal progress:
The experts (read: billionaires) agree on this point. Asset allocation is the key to successful investment and the only way to truly diversify your portfolio.
“But I diversify my portfolio,” you say. “I invest my money in an S&P index.”
That’s great! But what if the stock market is crap?You’re screwed.
Asset allocation goes beyond simply owning a lot of stock.
Asset Allocation is about owning a lot of unrelated asset classes: domestic stocks, international stocks, emerging market stocks, bonds, real estate, Treasuries, commodities, etc. It’s about putting your money in different buckets.
That way, if one of your buckets spills a leak, you do not lose everything.
As the topic itself already says, the main point of step five is to create a source of lifetime income. The strategy for this is simple:
To convert your money and render into a lifetime source of income, you need first to accumulate wealth. To help with this, Tony shares the “All Seasons” strategy developed by legendary investor Ray Dalio.
According to Dalio, there are four economic “stations” that move asset prices: inflation, deflation, growing economic growth, and declining economic growth. As such, different assets work well at different stations.
Considering that no one knows what the future holds, Dalio suggests that investors invest their assets to benefit equally from each economic season or “season”: 25% for inflation, 25% for deflation, 25% for economic growth and 25% for the decline of economic growth.
Imagine how you would feel if you knew that you would never run out of money. That’s right, for the rest of my life. Although it sounds too good to be true, there are some ways to convert your accumulated wealth into a lifelong source of income.
As Dr. Jeffrey R. Brown, a professor of finance at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, wrote in his paper Paycheck for Life: The Role of Annuities in Your Retirement Portfolio:
Simply put, if an individual accumulates enough wealth to cover the difference between their monthly income and their necessary expenses, then the retiree is free to invest and spend the rest of the portfolio however he desires, knowing that basic needs are covered no matter how long he/she lives.
In other words, if you can accumulate enough wealth, you can simply make money every month until you die. You can not worry about how you will make money when you are 90 years old.
Think about whether it does not seem much more fun to make money without working at age 90 while playing a game of checkers. Much more than working in a supermarket at this age, right?
Tony interviewed some millionaires and billionaires for the creation of this book. From these interviews, Tony synthesized four principles that united all of them together:
In the end, MONEY: Master the game is not about money. It’s about living your best life. Money is simply a tool to help you do this.
Even if you do not have there a large amount of money, the future still looks bright. As technology advances, more products, services, and experiences will be available to more and more people leveling the field between those who have and those who have no money.
Today, we have everything in our hands. Using a smartphone, we can access the sum of all human knowledge in a matter of seconds. We can ride our mechanical horse to a building filled with an unlimited source of fresh food.
We can use specialized 3D printers to print new body parts for people who need them.
Who knows what the future will bring? The only thing we can say with certainty is that human potential is virtually unlimited.
Tony Robbins makes a call for planning every move and programming a “dream bucket” to bring automated income over an unlimited period of time – your lifetime.
The last step is a 
 –
After the plan is well established it is very important to take action and to put all of it into practice. But everything we do we have to do with a passion to achieve the desired result with pleasure and ease.
At this point, we can see the spiritual side of man.
The author urges us not to run after money:
For 
 in life and to be sure that happiness will always accompany us, we should not neglect the other matters of our personal life. And by these Tony Robins means health, relationships, and family because 
At the end of the book, he uses his skills of a 
 and reminds us how the decisions we make can influence our good or bad mood, our reactions and last our vision of life.
This book seems to be divided into two parts, one is of 
 
 that can sustain the lifestyle chosen by each of us, and the second is about 
 to search our self-fulfillment
.
At first glance, this may seem like a paradox in which the author succeeds to balance very well but not subtly these two worlds: material fulfillment and self-fulfillment.
Even if you see the financial issue as a chess game or as a gamble, after reading this book you won’t have to struggle to figure out what’s the best for you: to save and invest or to share the material goods with those who lack them?
Final Notes:
At the end of our lives, it does not matter how much money we make over it, how we diversify our portfolio, or how often we beat the market. What is important is how you have improved the world around you.
As Tony writes near the end of the book, “Being the richest man in the graveyard is not the goal.” Instead, the goal is to live a meaningful life, whatever that means to you. For most of us, this means giving your time, energy and money to others.
Giving to others puts things in perspective. When you give to others, you realize that you have something to give. When you give to others, you realize that your life is not that bad.
So start giving your time, energy and money to others and start living a prosperous life today.
How about starting right now?"

You’re pregnant and anxious over what comes next?
Heidi Murkoff’s got you covered!
Ladies, the bible of American pregnancy:
Who Should Read “What to Expect When You’re Expecting”? And Why?
Well, it’s there in the title: the pregnant ones; but it’s also about those who plan to get pregnant and about those who want to get their lives back to normal after giving birth.
Finally, it’s also about dads-to-be – not only because there’s a chapter addressing them explicitly.
About Heidi Murkoff
 is an American writer.
Hours before delivering her first daughter quarter of a century ago, Murkoff delivered the proposal for a pregnancy guide to her publisher, aka the book she wished existed to help her go through the process.
Soon enough, in 1984, 
appeared, one of the 
, the longest-running 
bestseller in history.
The book evolved into a series of pregnancy guides and gave birth to What to Expect Foundation and the whattoexpect.com webpage.
Murkoff was chosen by 
magazine among the 100 Most Influential People in the World for 2011; in a way, she still is.
“What to Expect When You’re Expecting PDF Summary”
Quite rightly dubbed “the bible of American pregnancy,” 
is, perhaps, the most trusted pregnancy guide this side of the Atlantic.
With almost 20 million copies sold, it is certainly the bestselling one, and the most influential: it’s not only consistently near the top of 
Best Seller list for a few decades, but it was also selected (back in 2007) by 
as one of the 
.
Unsurprisingly, its author, Heidi Murkoff, was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the world by 
magazine four years later.
In a few words, 
explains everything
– and we do mean 
– you need to know about pregnancy, from pre-conception through week-by-week growth to birth and beyond.
The book has gone through five editions, but please note that the summary below runs through the contents of the fourth one and the fifth one is revised.
Also – and more importantly – visit 
, the Internet home of the book, where you should find absolutely everything you need.
On a side note, this book may be the only reference book in existence adapted into a movie: even though there’s no story whatsoever between its two covers, the 2012 same-titled blockbuster (starring everybody) is directly inspired by Murkoff’s book.
Part 1: First Things First
Usually, people buy this book only after they’re already pregnant, but that only means they should start the book at Chapter 2; because the first chapter is all about preparing for “the healthiest pregnancy – and baby – possible.”
Here you’ll find preconception prep for both moms and dads so that both parents can “get into tip-top baby-making shape.”
The chapter also includes several conception misconceptions – you should definitely check them out!
Here you’ll read everything about early pregnancy signs and diagnosing pregnancy, as well as about testing for the irregular or about the reasons for a negative or a no longer positive result.
In addition, the chapter includes a section on how to smartly test yourself, birthing choices and making the most of the patient-practitioner partnership.
If you’re like us, probably your first question is “what the hell is a pregnancy 
.” 
Heidi Murkoff defines it thus:
And this chapter is all about your pregnancy profile, aiming to “help you take stock of your pregnancy profile and figure out how it may affect—or may not affect—your nine months of baby making.”
There’s absolutely everything here!
From a section on birth control during pregnancy through a series of Q&A sections related to some gynecological conditions (fibroids, endometriosis, HPV, STDs, herpes) to everything about your obstetrical history and what to do if you’re having a baby after 35.
Here you’ll read all about prenatal diagnosis, first-trimester ultrasound, and combined screening, and what to do if a problem is found. 
As you know full well, pregnancy comes with adjustments in your everyday life.
If you’re wondering just “how drastically your lifestyle will have to change now that you’re living for two,” then start with this chapter.
Sports and exercise are still good, and you don’t need to change that part of your lifestyle; you just need to be a bit more moderate.
The same holds true for caffeine, but it doesn’t for drinking and smoking.
In other words, “there’s just no research to support” that either, even in small amounts, is a completely safe bet and the Surgeon General, the ACOG and the AAP advise that no amount of alcohol is safe for pregnant women, and that “that smoking during pregnancy, particularly beyond the third month, isn’t just hazardous to your health – but to your baby’s, too.”
Of course, saying that isn’t the same as giving up on smoking completely, so in this chapter, you’ll find advice on how to break your smoking habit and how to deal with secondhand smoke.
Drugs are covered as well, and no need to say that all of them are strictly forbidden as well; yup, even marijuana.
By the way, this chapter also includes a section on “Complementary and Alternative Medicine” so be sure to check it out before trying any of the practices; some are good, but some may pose a risk to pregnant women.
“The challenge during pregnancy isn’t just to eat (though that may be challenge enough during those early months)” – writes Heidi Murkoff at the beginning of Chapter 5. “It’s to eat as well as you can.”
Think of it this way:
“Eating well when you’re expecting is one of the first and best gifts you can give to your soon-to-arrive bundle of joy – and it’s a gift that can keep on giving, handing out not just a healthier start in life but a healthier lifetime.”
If you’re looking for healthy alternatives to your favorite foods, you’ll find them here:
Whatever you do, don’t forget the “Nine Basic Principles for Nine Months of Healthy Eating”:
#1. Bites count.
#2. All calories are not created equal. 
#3. Starve yourself, starve your baby.
#4. Efficiency is effective.
#5. Carbohydrates are a complex issue.
#6. Sweet nothings are exactly that.
#7. Good foods remember where they came from.
#8. Healthy eating begins at home.
#9. Bad habits can sabotage a good diet.
More or less, it all boils down to this: if you like something, but you think your baby won’t – take the fork out of your mouth!
Needless to add, there are many more advises such as this in this chapter, amounting to a complete Pregnancy Diet Plan.
Part 2: Nine Months & Counting: From Conception to Delivery
“Congratulations, and welcome to your pregnancy!” – that’s how the second part of 
begins.
It’s divided into nine chapters, but each of them is, in turn, divided into many sections, the first few of which describe everything that’s happening in your stomach week-by-week during that month.
Chapter 6 is about the first four weeks, during which your body will be gearing up for the months of baby-making to come.”
This is when “you’ll notice changes in parts of your body you’d expect (like your belly), as well as places you wouldn’t expect (your feet and your eyes). You’ll also notice changes in the way you live – and look at – life.”
Here, you’ll find all about these early symptoms as well as about the ways to alleviate some of the negative ones (like fatigue and morning sickness).
As all of the chapters in this second part, this one too starts with an explanation of how your baby looks like this month and what you may be feeling.
Next, it moves on to explain common nuisances at this stage, including heartburn and indigestion, food aversions and cravings, as well as visible, spider, and varicose veins.
It next moves on to some less common problems such as an achy, swollen pelvis, breakouts, dry skin and eczemas, mood swings, depressions, and panic attacks.
It also tells you everything you need to know about weight gain, from the normal rate of gaining weight to weight gain red flags.
You get the drill by now: your baby this month and your thoughts are the first things covered, and then everything that’s the sign of normal pregnancy to everything that may go wrong.
Topics covered here are constipation, diarrhea, headaches, corpus luteum cyst, stretch marks, and many others.
Since this is the month when you may first hear “the amazing sound of your baby’s heartbeat” at the checkup, there’s everything about that too.
The chapter also reveals a thing or two about your increased sex drive at this time, as well as about the uncomfortability of being a pregnant worker; a great thing about this book is that it also includes an introduction to your rights as a pregnant worker, as well as the outlines of a possible unfair treatment at work.
Once again, after the usual things are covered – your baby this month, what you may be feeling, a look inside, what you can expect at this month’s checkup, what you may be wondering about – Murkoff moves on to the possible annoyances and problems.
It starts with dental problems and nasal stuffiness and nosebleeds, before moving on to topics such as vaginal discharge, elevated blood pressure, sugar in the urine, and anemia.
Fetal movement is also covered, as well as the topic of maternity clothes and “looking slim when you’re bulking up.” 
Here you can also read all about why and how to exercise during pregnancy.
Moving on: the fifth month comes with dizziness, backache, abdominal aches, foot growth, and fast-growing hair and nails; as scary as it may sound, it’s only the usual.
There are many travel advices here, starting from the obvious (say, wearing a seat belt) to whether it’s safe for you to travel by plane.
Merely mentioned in the previous chapters, sex during pregnancy is here analyzed thorough, with all its benefits and setbacks.
After finding out how your baby looks like in the sixth month and what you can expect at this month’s checkup, Chapter 11 moves on to cover topics such as sleeping troubles, protruding navel, itchy bell, clumsiness, numbness in the hands and leg cramps.
It also covers some possibly more serious problems (“when something just doesn’t feel right”), ranging from preeclampsia to bleeding.
The chapter also includes a section on childbirth education: whether you need it and what type would be preferable.
The third and final trimester means excitement and anticipation – but also multiplied pregnancy aches and pains.
Consequently, Murkoff revisits some topics here – such as fatigue and lower back pain – while also sharing everything you need to know about kick count, fetal hiccups, and even accidental falls. 
It’s the eighth month, and it’s time you learn something more about Braxton Hicks contractions, “not-so-funny rib tickling” and the lack of bladder control. 
Other topics covered here include choosing a pediatrician, your weight gain and the baby’s size, the baby’s position, and all about cesarean delivery.
The eighth month is the perfect time to start learning more about breastfeeding – and that goes for the fathers as well! 
“Finally,” writes Murkoff. “The month you’ve been waiting for, working toward, and possibly worrying about just a little bit is here at long last. Chances are you’re at once very ready (to hold that baby … to see your toes again … to sleep on your stomach!) and not ready at all.”
The ninth month is the longest month of all, and it’s the most suitable one to read a paragraph on two about leaky breasts, urinary frequency, and due dates and overdues.
Finally, Chapter 14 is the one in which you – and your partner – can find out all about prelabor, false labor, and real labor, including the symptoms for each and the right moment to call the practitioner.
The nine months have passed, you’re into labor, and it’s time you deliver your baby to this world. Don’t panic: 
has everything covered.
Chapter 15 includes sections on topics such as darkened amniotic fluid, irregular contractions, and emergency delivery.
And many others, including fetal monitoring, artificial rupture of membranes, episiotomy, forceps, vacuum extraction, etc.
In a nutshell – once again – everything you need to know; might we add: maybe even more than that.
Part 3: Twins, Triplets & More: When You’re Expecting Multiples
The third part of 
consists entirely of one chapter, and the chapter is entirely about what you may be wondering about when you discover that you’re expecting more than one child.
Here you’ll read all about eating well with multiples, exercising properly, laboring with twins, twin timing, positioning, and delivering twins and triplets. 
Part 4: After the Baby Is Born 
After the baby is born, you’re officially a mother, but you’re also unofficially still on the pregnancy territory:
Whether you’re interested in how to deal with afterpains, delivery bruises, excessive sweating, or engorged breasts – you’ll find everything here.
The chapter also includes a breastfeeding guide, covering everything from the basics and the appropriate diet, through medication and lactation to sore nipples and bottle babies. 
“Though most of your questions and concerns are likely to be baby-related” after the first postpartum week, “you’re sure to have some that are a little more mommy-centric, too, from the state of your emotions (‘Will I ever stop crying during insurance commercials?’), to the state of your sexual union (‘Will I ever want to do 
again?), to the state of your waist (‘Will I ever be able to wear jeans that zip?’).”
The answers to all of the above questions are “yes,” but these are only a few of the many answered in this chapter.
Others include baby blues, postpartum backache, and workout rules for the first six weeks after birth.
My god, the information in this book is a little short of overwhelming: there’s 
 absolutely everything here.
Part 5: For Dads
Speaking of everything: time for a chapter which should interest dads in particular.
Murkoff addresses them:
In a way, she says that dads should really read the whole book through, but this chapter especially – which is not for the eyes only.
Here dads can read all about how to deal with their partner’s symptoms and how to survive her mood swings, and, of course, how to deal with their sex urges both during pregnancy and after delivery. 
Part 6: Staying Healthy When You’re Expecting
Staying healthy while you’re expecting a child doesn’t concern only you – it concerns your child as well.
That’s what this chapter is all about, providing guides on what to do and which medications are safe to treat some of the most common diseases.
These are the diseases covered: the common cold, sinusitis, flu, fever, strep throat, urinary tract infection, yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis, stomach bugs, listeriosis, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, fifth disease, measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, Lyme disease, hepatitis A to C, and Bell’s palsy. 
What about chronic conditions?
Don’t worry, there’s a chapter for that too!
And it answers all of the questions you might have about the most common chronic diseases – in alphabetical order!
The chronic conditions covered in this chapter are asthma, cancer in pregnancy, cystic fibrosis, depression, diabetes, epilepsy, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, hypertension, irritable bowel syndrome, lupus, multiple sclerosis, phenylketonuria, rheumatoid arthritis, scoliosis, sickle cell anemia, and thyroid disease.
To tell you the truth, we feel a little sick at the moment.
But we only got two chapters to finish our summary, so we believe that we’ll make it through; after all, women go through this for nine months.
Somehow, we now appreciate them even more.
Part 7: The Complicated Pregnancy
The seventh part of 
deals with complicated pregnancies; Chapter 22 goes through all of the possible problems, and Chapter 23 is a manual on how to get through if the worst-case scenario becomes a reality.
Here, there’s everything you need to know about miscarriages and a bunch of other things we know not one thing about.
We’ll just list some of them (we repeat: some of them!) for those who do: ectopic pregnancy, subchorionic bleed, hyperemesis gravidarum, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, intrauterine growth restriction, placenta previa, placental abruption, chorioamnionitis, oligohydramnios, hydramnios, preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM), etc. etc.
We didn’t even get to half; possibly because we don’t really want to think about complicated pregnancies; may there be fewer and fewer with each passing second.
“Pregnancy is supposed to be a joyous time,” writes Murkoff in the introduction to this chapter, “filled with excitement, anticipation, and pink-and-blue daydreams about life with your baby-to-be (mixed in with a little normal trepidation and anxiety).”
“And usually, it is all of those things, but it isn’t always. If you’ve experienced the loss of a pregnancy or a newborn, you know firsthand that the depth of your pain can be beyond words. This chapter is dedicated to helping you handle that pain and cope with one of life’s most difficult losses.”
Key Lessons from “What to Expect When You’re Expecting”
1.      Conception Misconceptions
2.      Nine Rules for Nine Months of Eating Well
3.      Pregnancy Is for Dads Too
Conception Misconceptions
“You’ve heard plenty of old wives’ – and new Internet – tales about how best to make a baby,” writes Heidi Murkoff in one of her thousands of lessons in this book (it’s really ungrateful to choose only three).
However, many of them are no more than myths.
For example, having sex every day 
decrease the chances of getting pregnant: it may even increase them.
Also, wearing boxer shorts doesn’t increase fertility and missionary is not the only position in which one can get pregnant: “unless sperm have a motility problem, they’ll reach their target no matter what position you’re in while you’re doing it.”
Finally, daytime sex doesn’t help you conceive faster – it makes no difference – but there’s no reason for you to act as if it does.
Nine Rules for Nine Months of Eating Well
We’ve already shared them with you, but here they are yet again:
 
Try to make your pregnancy bites count by choosing them (at least most of the time) with baby in mind.”
Or,
in other
words,
“200 calories in a doughnut are not equal to the 200 calories in a whole-grain raisin-bran muffin.”
That’s pretty self-explanatory.

A really good story for an autobiography. In 
, the emphasis is mostly on Welch’s career and less of his private life.
So, let’s take a look 
’s professional life story.
General Electric is one of the biggest companies in the world. The fact that over the last 30 years it developed and bought a lot of other small companies and ended up in businesses from aircraft engines and power generators to plastics, medical, and financial services, is due in great part to Jack Welch and his vision.
“Jack: Straight from the Gut PDF Summary”
He realized that he could do anything and transform every business into a success, as long as he had by his side the right people.
. But after working a few years with General Electrics, he realized that he really enjoyed his work and he wanted to climb the ladder as high as possible.
Even though he was not one of the top favorites for the position, the fact that he had a vision and he had good instincts helped him get the job. He was not always right about his decisions. Some deals were not profitable at all.
You may say it was like a game of trial and error until he 
. That he could see a good deal from the beginning of the negotiations.
Jack Welch understood that 
 for the thousands of people that work for you. Having such a large company, it was difficult to create a culture that helped everyone feel like a part of the team and feel connected.
This is why Jack invested a lot in training, creating facilities for conferences and meetings. Even if he had to let go some of the employees, 
 in things that in the long-term made all the difference. Jack understood from the beginning that it’s all about the people:
So 
He wanted to work only with the best and make them feel appreciated and welcomed in GE.
In order to do this, he had to be very drastic about the differentiation system
He implemented an 
 
 had to apply in every company that was part of General Electrics.
Based on the evaluation, all the people that scored in the bottom 10% had to be removed from the company.
It was hard, especially because at first the managers refused to cooperate and were offering misleading results. But in the end, everyone understood that on a long-term, this is the only way that General Electrics could stay on top.
Another thing that Welch did not like in General Electrics and that he struggled a lot to change, was 
:
His vision was not always supported by his colleagues. And many times there were stories in media about his controversial decisions.
After 20 years as the head of GE,

, listening to their ideas and finding ways of giving your employees a voice.
Maybe someone has a brilliant idea, but because of the bureaucracy and the multilevel system you implemented, that idea can never reach you
The book may seem very detailed and sometimes you may find the amount of information about different deals and acquisitions overwhelming. But this remains a very important reading for all those that work with people and are in top positions in big companies.
Jack’s vision can inspire you and guide you in this world where most businesses think only about profit. You have to think about the people and the quality of your products and services, and the profits won’t be unpredictable

It’s also for those who want to create an independent personal brand, so they can easily adapt to new events.
“The Start-Up of You PDF Summary”
The book has 7 chapters that guide you towards building the career of your dreams with concrete actions. What’s particularly useful is that each chapter ends with advice about how you can make significant changes in your professional life.
The way we relate to our jobs has changed significantly in the last few decades.
If our parents were likely to find a cozy job in their early twenties, 
 and retire after 35 years of hard work, today things are nothing like that. In their early twenties, people change a lot of jobs.
They refuse to settle for boring or conventional jobs and keep searching until they find one that suits them. Employers are also different.
Since they now have access to a wide range of people from all over the world, they’re pickier and search for more sophisticated aptitudes.
Also, they’re reluctant to invest so much in you because they’re not sure how long you will stay:
Another thing that has changed is the way we perceive our career. Before, people would only consider finding a new job if they were laid off or really wanted a change. Nowadays young people are always connected, always learning about new opportunities, always keeping an eye out for something better.
The amount of time you spend at any job is shrinking. That’s why you always need to be aware of other options, and sometimes take risks, even when it seems your current job has it all.
Companies don’t work like they used to; they merge, transform, and replace people much faster than before.
And they have access to cheap labor from all over the world. 
 that you’ll stay with the same company until you retire.
So what should you do in order to build a strong career in this fast-changing and volatile environment?
The answer is both simple and complex: you need to think like an entrepreneur and consider your career as your start-up. This means having a different approach from the other job candidates out there.
Building niche skills, adding tons of passion to everything you do, and staying connected are only a few ingredients in the recipe.
But we all need to realize that the rules of the game have changed and that, for every great interview you’ll have, 50 others will show up with maybe better skills and lower salary expectations. The traditional way of building your career is no longer a safe option.
Instead, young people, these days build networks. They nurture relationships with people that are valuable to them professionally because they know that, at some point, they’ll need to seek opportunities in that direction. Also, people nowadays don’t limit themselves to one 9-to-5 job.
They like to find a field or connecting fields that they are passionate about, and explore different types of activities in that area.
This is very good for designing your individual path and building an identity that’s different from the company you work for. If you work in marketing and are really interested in the field, you could also write a blog, create your own podcast, do public speaking gigs, or become a certified trainer in that subject.
This way you will not only always have a wide range of career options at your disposal, but people will also get to know you 
 you created for yourself. It’s like a safety net that you build:
In order to stay relevant, you need to always evaluate and develop your skills, and be ready to adapt. Having a 5 or 3-year long-term plan is no longer a viable solution. You may need to shift your focus and re-think your career faster than you think.
Technology is transforming our world faster than ever, and in a few years, some jobs may become obsolete. This is why you need a strong network of people from different fields who can keep you up-to-date with the progress and show you what opportunities are out there.
The interesting thing about opportunities is that they never come at a perfectly-timed moment. You seldom find out about a great new job when you’re desperately searching for one. It usually happens when you’re feeling pretty cozy at your current job.
So what do you do? Do you take a risk? Or do you keep your current position, because it’s a safer option?
Risks are becoming an integrated part of our lives. In order to succeed at the start-up of you, there are a lot of risks to be taken.
In order to stay ahead of the game, you need to take chances that others perceive as risks. How will you manage to differentiate them?
One simple answer is to invest in yourself: take classes; go to seminars; 
, decision-making under pressure, and risk management.
Also, surround yourself with the people that you’d like to become like. Find inspiration in others that have the career you dream about, take them to lunch and pick their brains about what opportunities are out there.
We are social beings, and the people we know and have good relationships with can help us. It’s not a company that hires you, it’s a person. You can make yourself the most qualified candidate for the job.
If you lack people skills, your chances diminish a lot. It’s no longer just about diplomas and qualifications. You need interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence, and other soft skills in order to build a strong career.
You can develop the start-up of you by applying 
. Make every decision in life based on these skills and you’ll develop an entrepreneurial mindset that will help you in the long run.

Want to attract more women?
Then forget all about PUA artists and every single advice you’ve ever read written by them.
At least according to Mark Manson, there’s a much simpler trick – which is not even a trick.
All you need to attract women is honesty; and that’s true regardless of the type of women.
Hell, you can even date 
this way!
Who Should Read “Models”? And Why?
If you want to “a detailed guide to modern sexual interactions” (
), but you can’t stand the tone or the misogyny inside those manosphere manuals (such as 
, 
or 
), then 
is the book for you.
This one’s much more women-friendly, and, according to Mark Manson himself, most of it can be used by both female and LGBTQI readers, since its core principles “apply to all human beings, regardless of gender, orientation, genitalia or whatever.”
About Mark Manson
 is an American blogger, entrepreneur, and bestselling author.
Two years after graduating from Boston University with a degree in finance in 2007, Manson started his first blog as a marketing channel for his dating service business.
However, that all changed in 2011 after he self-published through Amazon a dating advice book titled 
. Even though with no marketing, no publicity, and no promotion, word of mouth made the book a tremendous hit and by early 2012, Manson was earning enough to make a living as an author.
So, he quit coaching and focused solely on his writing; after substantially revising 
for three different editions, in 2016, Manson published

“Models PDF Summary”
Just like 
 is Mark Manson’s no-nonsense reaction to the impracticability and deceitfulness of the self-help publishing industry, 
is his scathing attack on the dishonesty and deceptiveness of the pick-up artist community and its core values and ideas. 
Self-described as “the most mature and honest guide on how a man can attract women without faking behavior, without lying and without emulating others,” 
is not a book of tricks or shortcuts.
It is a book which strives to teach you how to become everything that your innate attractiveness potential promises that you can be and, thus, become a catch for the women recognizing it.
Part I: Reality
One of the first rules of attractiveness according to Mark Manson is this: 
And if you need a definition of neediness, it is “when a man places a higher priority on others’ perceptions of him than his perception of himself.”
In practice, this means that you are needy if you alter your feelings, thoughts, and motivations (aka 
) relation to the women you want to get.
As a rule of thumb, “you should not be willing to sacrifice your thoughts, feelings, and motivations for someone else more than they sacrifice theirs for you.”
It’s basic evolution, in the end: women were forced by the gritty reality of the past hundred thousand years to choose the men who control their destiny, the men unfazed by the threats posed to them.
If you were a woman, after all, who would you choose: the man described above, or the one who can’t stand up for himself and whose emotions are dictated by those around him?
Yeah, we too.
Most people today associate vulnerability with weakness, despite the fact that 
.
And that is especially true in the case of men!
However, Mark Manson subverts this narrative: the more vulnerable you’re willing to be, the more powerful you can become, he says.
Think of it this way:
All the things that matter – whether banal such as saying a joke which may not be funny or serious such as expressing an unpopular opinion you feel to be true – require you to stick your neck out on the line emotionally in some way.
In other words, you’re making yourself vulnerable when you do these things.
Needless to add, you’re making yourself even more vulnerable when you’re telling a woman you like her and want to date her.
Now, you can listen to all those PUAs and act all aloof when you do that; in the short-term, it may work, and you may get the girl.
But bear in mind: you didn’t even get off to a good start with her!
That was not you at the very beginning since you chose to suppress your emotions so as not to be hurt; however, in the long run, that means that you will never be able to build a healthy relationship with this girl.
The foundations are all wrong.
To become more vulnerable, you need to become more attuned to your emotions and more accepting of the fact that you might get hurt quite a few times.
However, with time, you’ll not only develop the right attitude but also grow into a healthy individual in touch with his own feelings and emotions.
Win-win.
Now, the whole idea behind the very existence of PUAs presupposes that dating is nothing short of a game which 
 be rigged – if you know how.
Mark Manson thinks otherwise: as you know full well from experience, you’re never the only one who knows how to bend the rules.
In other words, if you’re cheating during a game and winning, then you’re either probably playing with someone that’s (for better or worse) not in your league (no, that’s not a compliment if you follow!) or, quite probably, you’re about to be cheated yourself out of success in a more profound manner.
Neil Strauss’ second book – coincidentally titled 
and published four years after 
– proved Manson right.
The point?
If you’re in it for the sex and you’re comfortable with turning your love life into an endless series of meaningless one-night stands, then you need nothing but the PUA community to guide you.
However, if you’re planning on finding a woman, you’ll be able to talk to and sleep next to, then how on earth is a lie going to get you there?
In time, vulnerable men mature enough to be able to accept one of the most uncomfortable truths of life: namely, that “with most of the women you meet, things are simply not going to work no matter what you do or say.”
But that’s fine, notes Manson:
Part II: Strategy
Full honesty, writes Mark Manson, is polarizing.
But to understand that sentence you need first to know that there are three categories of women: Unreceptive, Neutral, and Receptive.
Women who are Unreceptive are “unavailable and/or uninterested in having a sexual/romantic relationship with you.”
Neutral women are those who don’t offer or reciprocate themselves, while not necessarily turning down your offers.
Finally, Receptive women who are sexually/romantically attracted to you.
Now back to the first sentence of this chapter summary.
True honesty, according to Mark Manson, transforms Neutral women and makes them either Unreceptive or Receptive.
Regardless of what anyone would tell you – especially PUAs – 
 are good. “Rejection exists for a reason,” writes Manson, “it’s a means to keep people apart who are not good for each other.”
In other words, if you lie your way through the receptiveness of a neutral woman, you’ll just be wasting your time, because, well, it’s not you that she’s attracted to.
If you’re honest, it’s a win-win: even if you’re rejected, you’ll know that it’s because the real you is incompatible with the real her:
“I see every rejection simply as some form of incompatibility,” writes Manson in the fifth chapter of 
, once again highlighting one of the main ideas of the book:
Indeed, it is when you think about that: life is too short to spend it with the wrong people. 
In more ways than one, you should be more than happy that there exist such things as rejections!
The Three Fundamentals of Attraction – i.e., “the three ways in which a man can become more vulnerable and become less needy” – are the following:
• 
: Creating an attractive and enriching lifestyle.
• 
: Overcoming your fears and anxiety around socializing, intimacy and sexuality.
• 
: Mastering the expression of your emotions and communicating fluidly.
Manson spends the rest of the book to explore each of these in detail.
Part III: Honest Living
First of all, says Mark Manson, let’s get one thing straight: “age, money, and looks matter — in some cases a lot, in other cases, not a lot, but they still matter. And anyone who tells you that they don’t matter is lying.”
But secondly, neither of them matters nearly as much as most men think.
First of all, age. 
Studies have shown that while women’s attractiveness peaks at 21, men’s physical attractiveness peaks a decade later, at 31; moreover, the average 45-year-old is still considered as physically attractive as the average 18-year-old!
In other words: men, consider yourself more than happy! Fortunately for you, women usually judge a man’s status on style, grooming and how he presents himself; so, thanks to the fact that women are less shallow than men, you have much more time than the gentler sex.
Moving on to money.
Once again, it’s important because it reveals one’s status; so, its importance gradually increases with age; also, money is an important factor in the mind of many women who have spent their childhoods in poverty.
As for looks: interestingly enough, it tends to be valued most by women who 
good looks.
And this is the general truth: “women who only care about things such as looks and money,” writes Manson, “are usually going to be women who you’re not going to be interested in or who are not going to make you happy.”
Why?
Because they have no other interests.
So, you’re not missing out on much.
As we implied above, women and men judge attractiveness differently.
Men judge female beauty by physical traits first, personality and presentation second; most women, on the other hand, prefer personality and presentation to physical attractiveness.
That’s why Mark Manson dedicates the entirety of Chapter 8 to sharing a few important pieces of advice on how to present yourself.
The topics this chapter covers are quite a few and the suggestions for each just too many and too straightforward for us to be able to summarize them in brief.
We’ll give you a list of the former so that you know where to look if you need a specific type of advice:
• Fashion and fitness
• Body language
• Vocal tonality
• Developing character
• Bringing it all together
Part IV: Honest Action
As 
 and 
 discovered about a century ago, in a way, we are the stories we tell ourselves.
And as numerous psychologists have demonstrated in the meantime, these stories usually share one defining characteristic: they exist to protect the status quo, to safeguard our emotional inertia.
Put more simply: they are our defense mechanisms, the way our 
 helps us to cope with disappointments and rejections.
This, naturally, comes with a price: we constantly change, and we don’t know it.
The good part?
We have the power to change these stories and open ourselves to being more vulnerable and, thus, more attractive.
The stories we tell ourselves – “I’m too good for this girl,” “I’ve been with prettier ones” – should essentially help us overcome our anxiety.
However, the needier we are, the less this succeeds: anxiety, according to Manson, stems from our unwillingness to open up to the world and be vulnerable.
Manson’s main suggestion on how to overcome your anxiety is not really that different from the suggestion you’ll hear from every single psychotherapist with at least some basic education.
Namely, do not run away from your fear: embrace it.
Because, no matter what anyone tells you, you 
 escape from it; you can only integrate it within your existence.
Part V: Honest Communication
Any honest communication begins with honest intentions. 
“Your ability to connect with a woman emotionally,” writes Manson, “is proportional to how self-aware you are of your own emotional processes and motivations.”
Ultimately, self-awareness and vulnerability are the things women want most in men – especially if the men are a bit rugged at the beginning
That’s the archetype 
: the Beauty and the Beast, “the taming of the wild man by the desirable and virginal woman.”
Peterson mentions 
as an example, but Manson goes a step further: all romance novels, he says, share the exact same pattern.
“This is more or less the blueprint of seduction,” he goes on, “strong, high status, attractive exterior (lifestyle and looks), fearless, and able to open up and share your vulnerable side with her.”
Apparently, “women get weak in the knees” for this.
And you can achieve it in three steps:
• Become aware of your emotions and motivations;
• Take the lead and be the first one who’ll share them;
• May your stories become more and more personal over time.
She’ll share her stories with you in no time.
And that’s emotional connection at its best.
The best part?
It’s honest!
By his own admission, this chapter grants a whole book in itself, so Manson merely glosses over the most important aspects of flirting here.
He points out – yet again – that first impressions matter and that startling or scaring someone upon approach is “the only death knell for approaching women.”
He then advises men to use effective language and statements instead of questions, in addition to revealing how to spin out endless conversation topics out of anything a woman might say.
Finally, he moves on to storytelling, the basics of emotional connection, and caps his discussion on flirting with – what else? – a few pieces of advice on good vs. bad humor.
“Like it or not,” writes Manson in the first paragraph of this chapter, the dating process follows a somewhat rigid line.”
In particular: “boy meets girl, asks girl on date, corresponds with girl, sets up date with girl, corresponds with girl, sets up second date with girl, repeat until eventually you bring girl home with you, and at some point you decide if you’re exclusive, non-exclusive, a casual couple, fuck buddies, soul-mates, or never want to see each other ever again.”
Manson covers all of the stages here, but mostly focuses on the process of exchanging phone numbers and the strategies for a perfect date.
As far as the latter is concerned, he advises a lot of 
 activities and changing venues. So, basically, not unlike 
.
That you should be the one organizing it all and making all the moves is a given.
This book was always going to end with a discussion about sex, wasn’t it?
We won’t go too deep into this one topic – pun unintended – but suffice to say that Manson remains consistent throughout his whole book with regards to his core principles, and this chapter is no exception.
So, don’t be afraid to go for it: if you’re wrong in your analysis of her signals, you’ll be rejected which is (once again!) much better than thinking “what could have been.”
Also: be confident and generous, but, above all, be dominant:
Here are Manson’s four suggestions on how to become dominant in bed:
• Be loud. Make noise. Grunt. Breathe hard.
• Talk dirty, even if it is outside your comfort zone.
• Get physical, picking her up and moving her yourself.
• Don’t ever ask “Is this OK? Do you want to do X?” That’s a big turn off.
Key Lessons from “Models”
1.      Be Vulnerable, But Never Needy
2.      Truth Polarizes – So Be Honest
3.      The Three Fundamentals of Attractiveness
Be Vulnerable, But Never Needy
“A man’s attractiveness is inversely proportional to how needy he is” – that’s the first rule in Mark Manson’s dating advice book.
In other words, if you want to be attractive, don’t act needy. 
Be vulnerable instead.
This doesn’t mean acting weak; it merely means putting your neck out there, exposing yourself and your true emotions and risking to be hurt.
Because that’s how you grow and develop into an attractive mature man.
Truth Polarizes – So Be Honest
There are three types of women: unreceptive, neutral, and receptive.
The former are the ones who won’t return your advances, while the latter the ones who do; the middle ones are those who neither accept them nor turn you down.
When you’re honest about your feelings, you are polarizing the woman you share them with.
In other words, you’re either making her unreceptive or receptive.
Either way, it is great, since rejection exists for a reason. It’s nature’s way of telling you that you’re incompatible with someone.
And life is too short to spend it on people you’re incompatible with.
The Three Fundamentals of Attractiveness
The Three Fundamentals of Attraction are “the three ways in which a man can become more vulnerable and become less needy.”
These are:
• 
: Creating an attractive and enriching lifestyle.
• 
: Overcoming your fears and anxiety around socializing, intimacy and sexuality.
• 
: Mastering the expression of your emotions and communicating fluidly.

“Models Quotes”
Our Critical Review
As we said in the Introduction, Manson’s 
is far more honest and far less misogynistic than most of the dating advice books targeted at men and written during the past two decades.
However, it still resorts to quite a few dubious evolutionary explanations, and it still pictures women as subconsciously submissive beings who can’t rise above their innate desire to mate with a civilized beast. And that’s neither fair nor true.Even so, Manson’s 
, with its insistence on vulnerability and truthfulness, should certainly help many men become more attractive, and many women – less disappointed in men.

Due to social pressure, bad habits, or simply self-esteem issues, we tend to walk away from challenges.
Although Rachel puts the emphasis on women, this is accurate for both sexes.
Achieving your goals, or following your dreams meets its greatest nemesis – doubt & shame.
Let’s find the antidote.
Who Should Read “Girl, Stop Apologizing”? And Why?
Evidently, “
” is intended for the female audience, because it empowers women to take hold of their life.
In the process, Rachel blames no other than the “I” itself, which is filled with concepts that hinder this growth.
Stop apologizing, and accept the shame-free plan!

 which remained on the best-selling position for almost an entire year.
Apart from being a writer, she is also a TV personality, motivational speaker, and a mother of four.
“Girl, Stop Apologizing PDF Summary”
What if you are not compelled to please anyone about anything?
Does that seem too harsh?
It’s okay to admit that – we all probably pretend to be endorsing the claim that opinions of others don’t matter to us, but more often than not we find ourselves hurt by them.
Even Rachel doesn’t always succeed in discarding the impulses coming from the other side of the fence. 
So, the key thing is not to have this sense of guilt for whatever you want to accomplish!
Nonetheless, whatever dream you have, sooner or later is going to be questioned.
Your only responsibility is to make sure that the environment and people around you, will not shatter it.
Rachel points out that a large percentage of women lack self-appreciation and the wits needed to hold onto their vision of themselves. 
They occasionally talk themselves out of their own dreams, while clinging to some shallow excuse.
Excuse #1 – That’s Not What Other Women Do
Any dream starts with a simple question and soon enters into the planning stage, where it often fades away.
There are a lot of “What Ifs,” which if properly understood could signify the beginning of a new era.
Let’s take a hypothetical overview on this matter.
Can you imagine what could happen if only 5% of all women, embraced the “
” mentality? This outlook on life is composed of self-respect, dignity, and willingness to push the boundaries.
Do you have any idea on how cheerful, and self-fulfilled these women would be? 
And yet, we are taught that women should feel guilty about something they want to achieve. Don’t blame society just yet, because Rachel identifies a culprit from within, and that’s what you should do as well.
By the same token, there are some people who love to procrastinate and others who can be labeled as overachievers.
In which category do you fall into?
Unfortunately, as we said, many women still suffer from other people’s opinions. It’s so ingrained in them that even resisting this notion seems like a tougher nut to crack than merely accepting it and move on.
Let’s cut to the chase!
First off, you need to understand that being at the helm, doesn’t come absent sacrifice. 
Rachel asserts that embracing personal responsibility as a child leads to better execution as an adult.
It goes without saying that identification with something starts when we are toddlers.
In other words, we are taught that pretending to be somebody other than yourself is how things unfold.
Living a double life was no exception to Rachel.
So many things were wrapped into this lifestyle, that seemed as if pursuing her goals was like a fantasy that’s not worthy of her energy.
As a consequence of that, she decided to bury her dreams deep inside her, never to allow them to flourish at the very least.
It took Rachel almost four years to initiate significant changes regarding her dreams.
At one point, she started 
 and began seriously ruminating on other possibilities.
Blogging was trendy, and she decided to give it a go.
When she started blogging, Rachel already had an event-planning firm in downtown LA, and a pretty successful one to say the least.
Rachel admits that at the outset of this transition, she didn’t know what the heck to do. So, Rachel wrote casual posts about her daily life and took random pictures.
With time, business began to emerge out of the shadows.
But one day, all hell broke loose.
People who were following her discovered that she wasn’t, in fact, a stay-at-home mom (in the traditional sense).
She had help with regards to content production and editing, and her husband also helped her out a lot.
In the meantime, a group of angry followers attacked her for having a nanny, because they felt betrayed. On the other end of the line, Rachel was shocked to see and eventually understand that people perceive others in a way that correlates with their self-image.
So many years have passed, and Rachel still felt this remorse for not being able to battle her way through life.
The transition took place when she stopped apologizing for her life-choices.
While growing up, she noticed that society determines your value based on the selection of traits that describe perfect male or female behavior.
Excuse #2 – I am Not a Goal-Oriented Person
You better read that twice, so that you digest it a bit better.
If you think about it, a dream is nothing but a goal, that still hasn’t reached the implementation phase. 
Unlike dreams, goals tend to be more specific, or you might say that the ideas are coming your way.
Without action, or steps leading to the achievement of those goals; encouragement and positivity are utterly worthless. 
It may sound like a cliché, but if you have low self-esteem and if you don’t trust in your ability to make changes, then you really won’t be able to handle the heat.
Excuse #3 – I Don’t Have Time
This false argument is something that most people can relate to.
Well, here’s the cure to this issue.
You don’t need to find time to 
; you’d have to take the time yourself that will bring those goals within reach.
Excuse #4 – I am Not Enough to Succeed
Even the smartest people at some point in their lives had this feeling of worthlessness.
Rachel calls out the voice in our heads that can also be labeled as the blabbermouth who finds joy in pointing out all the flaws that manifest your triviality.
Fight it, and don’t allow it to make you feel like crap. 
Excuse #5 – I Can’t Pursue My Dream and Still Be a Good Mom/Daughter/Employee
This is a very common fear.
It’s like we feel guilty for putting our own interests above everyone else’s. 
Even though the people have different priorities and one can’t argue otherwise, it’s of exponential value to put your happiness upfront.
Then, you’ll be of better service to the people around you!
Excuse #6 – I am Terrified of Failure
Well, who isn’t?
But is that a legitimate reason for 
 and not giving it a shot regardless of how stupid it seems?
Absolutely not!
Tell everybody about your endeavors, and the pressure itself will make you perform better. Don’t shy away from having that extra burden on your shoulders, and keep your dreams afloat.
Excuse #7 – It’s Been Done Before
Some smarter person has already built that app, started that non-profit, created a similar company, wrote a similar book – I can go on.
Just imagine the idiocy here – you are literally blocking yourself out of your true self, without even attempting to question your position.
Excuse #8 – What Will They Think
In all honesty, their opinion is their business, not yours.
With that said, why we get hurt all the time by shallow and often mean comments?
You want to know the dirty secret? 
It’s not the fear of failure that keeps you down, but what others will think of you once you fail! 
Excuse #9 – Good Girls Don’t Hustle
You know better than anybody else what you are!
Rachel doesn’t disparage women with a more traditional sense who prefer the quiet life.
On the contrary, she values choice, and the choice you make is going to be your ticket way out.
, Rachel tells us which behaviors we ought to adopt.
Behavior #1 – Stop Asking Permission
Do we need to say more?
Your behavior is basically the reflection of your inner-perception of yourself.
 to do anything within the confines of morally-acceptable action.
It’s not rocket science to learn how to prioritize your tasks, and take pleasure in everything.
Behavior #2 – Choose One Dream and Go All In
Being a scatterbrain won’t do you any good!
According to Rachel, you can only focus on a single goal and making it work.
If there is no plan B, you’d be much more motivated to achieve your dreams, and climb up the ladder.
Behavior #3 – Embrace Your Ambition
These days, we bear witness to people who are scolded for being too ambitious. Women, generally speaking, receive criticism for having that burning desire to prosper in the material sense.
However, there are serious issues with failing to spot the signs of workaholism.
Taking the middle route is probably your best bet.
Behavior #4 – Ask for Help!
Sorry, but it’s impossible to do everything yourself, and there’s no shame in asking for an extra hand.
Getting to the next level requires training, experience, and time.
Rachel realized that there aren’t self-made successes, because one way or the other, you must rely on somebody!
Behavior #5 – Build Foundations for Success
It doesn’t matter whether you have the knowledge and the passion for achieving your dreams; if the daily timetable is there to sabotage your next move.
Let’s cover up a few things that could help you in the execution of this step:
Behavior #6 – Stop Allowing Them To Talk You Out of It
A thing that happens, a lot!
More often than not, the people discouraging you from moving on, are those from your closest circle.
Allowing someone to take control of what you do, truly is a recipe for imminent catastrophe.
You’ve got to break the habit of listening to what other people think about your plans.
Behavior #7 – Learn To Say No
Rachel has been taught or better yet, programmed to “love” certain things that she actually hated doing.
Nowadays, she prefers the brutally honest perspective that gives her enough freedom to make up her own mind and set up her schedule.
If you don’t like something – just say NO.
And to achieve all of this, you would need the following skillset:
Key Lessons from “Girl, Stop Apologizing”
1.      Girls, You Can Make It 
2.      Keep the Chin Up
3.      Embrace the Pressure
Girls, You Can Make it
After everything we said, this is an obvious conclusion.
Even if you feel like an underdog, no force in the world can stop a person who has no plan B in their pocket.
Just go for it!
Keep the Chin Up
People around you might not accept this transition.
It’s tough to keep your composure when nothing goes in your favor, but then again, you must find that resilience and perseverance to go through it.
Remember, don’t be a pushover.
Embrace the Pressure
A lot of times, you’d feel like giving up, but remember that Rachel failed more times than she could remember.
The magic lies in attempting, over and over again.
Don’t run away when things go South, because the sun always comes up after a storm.

“Can’t Hurt Me PDF Summary”
Look at these two photographs:
You may not believe us, but no – these two aren’t two different people; they are one and the same person, David Goggins, a man 
magazine recently named “The Fittest (Real) Man in America.”
The reason?
Well, Goggins is one of the world’s top endurance athletes, and the only man in human history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller.
Oh, he is also the guy who, until recently, held the Guinness World record for most pull-ups done in 24 hours.
Not to belittle your accomplishments, but that record stood at a little over 4,030 pull-ups – which is about 4,000 more than we can do. (Not to brag or anything.)
 is Goggins’ memoir; if you had watched it adapted as a blockbuster movie – something tells us that it inevitably will – you’d have probably said that it is just too Hollywood-like and that things like these never happen in real life.
And yes – this thing did.
And here’s how.
David Goggins’ Childhood
“We found hell in a beautiful neighborhood,” – that’s how David Goggins begins his autobiography. And you already know that he didn’t have a happy childhood.
The neighborhood he’s talking about is Williamsville, Buffalo, New York; the year is 1981 and Goggins is merely 6 years old; and hell is a corner lot on Paradise Road.
Why?
Because even though on Paradise Road everyone lives “near the top of the food chain,” and even though most of their neighbors believe that the Goggins family is “the tip of that spear,” under the surface, nothing is as beautiful as it seems.
“If Paradise Road was Hell,” notes Goggins ominously, “that meant I lived with the Devil himself.”
The Devil’s name: Trunnis Goggins, a self-made businessman and longtime owner of Skateland, a roller-disco rink; also: David’s father. Kind of a big deal in Williamsville: so much so that you can find his 
 in 
; however,
you won’t read in it what really matters.
And that is that Trunnis was a tyrannical father; built like a boxer, he tolerated no disobedience, no matter how unreasonable his demands had been.
One of these demands was that his 17 years younger wife Jackie and his children – David and Trunnis II – work for him tirelessly at the rink, every night until midnight; of course, this resulted in David regularly falling asleep in school the following day.
But it gets worse.
You see, Trunnis ran a prostitute ring; his pop-up brothel was the summer cottage of the president of one of Buffalo’s biggest banks; hence, the loans and the credits.
And the worst part?
David often witnessed Trunnis beating Jackie senseless with his leather belt, hitting her, dragging her by the hair; when David tried to help her, he beat him too.
The Things You Can’t Escape
In 1983, when David was 8 years old, Jackie had it just about enough: with the help of a sympathetic neighbor, she took David with her and hurriedly left Trunnis’ house, planning never to come back again.
Trunnis II didn’t want to live: despite Trunnis’ cruelty, he decided to stay with his father; fortunately, it seems that, despite the hardships, 
 (we had to do a bit of research).
Anyway, Jackie and David moved to the small town of Brazil, Indiana, where they suddenly had to adapt to an entirely different life.
Up until recently, they had lived in a rich neighborhood and could afford just about anything; and because of his father’s, ahem, connections, it didn’t even matter that they were black.
Suddenly, that had to live in a public housing block and get through the month on Jackie’s part-time job and a measly monthly welfare check.
To make matters worse, David started feeling the full power of his past’s demons; he started suffering from toxic stress, getting a stutter overnight, losing both his hair and his skin pigment: 
Coping with the Bitter Reality of Life
Another thing that toxic stress causes: memory loss. 
And not the good kind, as in “I’ll forget the bad things of my past to make room for the future and move on;” oh no – we’re talking about the bad kind, as in “What’s the point of learning the alphabet and remembering all these historical facts when someone could beat me up this very instant?”
In other words, David had serious problems finding his way around school, once even overhearing Ms. D., his teacher, telling Jackie that David belonged in a different school, one for “special students.”
It didn’t help that he was the only black kid in his class and that “Southern Indiana had always been a hotbed of racists.”
In 1991, David (still struggling with literacy, almost unbeknownst to anyone, because he was constantly cheating) opened up his Spanish class workbook to find, scribbled inside it, an image of him in a noose and below it the words: “Niger, we’re gonna kill you.”
And it didn’t stop there.
By the end of that year – David was almost 17 – his grandfather bought him a used, brown Chevy Citation. One of the first mornings he ever drove it to school, someone spray painted the word “nigger” – this time spelling it correctly – on his driver’s side door.
David started living in “a haze of hate, trapped in [his] fruitless rage and ignorance,” 
 and living in isolation of his community.
“By my junior year,” David writes, “I went out of my way to piss people off by becoming the exact stereotype racist white people loathed and feared.”
You know what he means: pants down, wild ‘dos, car stereo wired to house speakers.
Air Force Training 
“Everything I did was to get a reaction out of the people who hated me most because everyone’s opinion of me mattered to me, and that’s a shallow way to live,” writes Goggins.
“I was full of pain, had no real purpose, and if you were watching from afar, it would have looked like I’d given up on any chance of success. That I was heading for disaster. But I hadn’t let go of all hope. I had one more dream left: I wanted to join the Air Force.”
David’s grandfather had been a proud cook in Air Force for 37 years, and Goggins was inspired by him to join the Civil Air Patrol, the civilian auxiliary of the Air Force.
There, he became fascinated with Pararescue – “the guys who jump out of airplanes to pull downed pilots out of harm’s way.”
And for a while, everything was going great: at 6’2” and 175 pounds, David was “a star recruit” and was well-liked by his drill sergeant.
How could that not be?
He “was one of the best at push-ups, and the best at sit-ups, flutter kicks, and running.” But something he hadn’t expected was coming his way: water confidence.
“That’s a nice name,” says Goggins, “for a course where they try to drown your ass for weeks, and I was uncomfortable as hell in the water.”
So, what did David do?
What most of us would: he quit, one point behind honor grad.
Fast forward a few years, and David was but a shadow of himself, weighing almost twice as much as when in Air Force training, burying his shame at the kitchen table while being stuck in a night-shift pest exterminator job.
What a fall from grace!
Joining the Navy SEALs
And then, one day, while showering, David heard “a narrator’s voice filter through the steam” and coming from the TV. He caught a few snippets: “
.”
He rushed back to the living room and sat transfixed for at least 30 minutes. “The show,” informs us Goggins, “followed Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL (BUD/S) Training Class 224 through 
: the most arduous series of tasks in the most physically demanding training in the military.”
This – this was what he had always wanted to do:
With a new-found motivation, Goggins spent the next few weeks calling everybody, pleading for an opportunity to become a SEAL.
He finally found a suitable program, one for former military recruits.
The good news?
It was about to start in three months.
The bad news?
Goggins weighed 300 pounds at the time, and the maximum weight allowed was 191 pounds.
You know the ending of the story already, so no need to beat around the bush: Goggins made it! And he made through the training as well, finally achieving his dream of joining the Navy SEALs.
Ultra-Running
David Goggins, however, is rarely described as a Navy SEAL.
The first sentence of his 
, for example, looks (at the moment of writing) something like this: “David Goggins (born February 17, 1975) is an American ultramarathon runner, ultra-distance cyclist, triathlete, motivational speaker and author.”
In other words, Goggins is much more famous for his superhuman capabilities as an ultrarunner; and he began his career in ultramarathon running merely as a way to contribute to a good cause.
Namely, when several of his fellow Navy SEALs were killed in Afghanistan in 2005, he attempted to raise awareness by entering the Badwater-135 Ultramarathon.
However, he was told by organizers that it is an invitation-only event, so Goggins had to run at least one other ultramarathon first.
David entered the San Diego One Day 24-hour ultramarathon and was able to run the 100 miles in under 19 hours, despite the lack of preparation and the fact that he hadn’t run such an event ever before.
Badwater-135 was next.
You need to know something about that race: it not only describes itself as “the world’s toughest foot race,” but it quite probably is nothing less.
To finish it, you’d need to run 135 miles in the Badwater Basin in California’s Death Valley, starting at 279 below sea level (85 m) and ending at 8360 feet above it (2548 m).
And oh – it’s happening in July, when the temperatures can reach 130 °F (above 50 °C)!
David Goggins completed Badwater-135 in 30 hours, finishing in fifth place, an unheard-of achievement for a novice at an event very few people are capable of even finishing!
Once again: Goggins weighed 300 pounds at 24; it’s never too late.
Key Lessons from “Can’t Hurt Me”
1.      David Goggins’ Childhood Was a Nightmare
2.      Quitting Is Easy – Even for Champions
3.      With the Right Mindset and a Lot of Hard Work, You Can Do It Too
David Goggins’ Childhood Was a Nightmare
David Goggins spent his childhood in Williamsville, working night shifts on his father’s roller-disco rink; and as if that wasn’t enough, his father was a violent man – and a pimp – who’d beat him and his mother for every single form of disobedience.
Fortunately, when David was merely 8 years old, his mother escaped to the small town of Brazil, Indiana, taking David with her. 
Life still sucked, though: David was suffering from the consequences of toxic stress, and, as the only black kid at his school, he was often the victim of racist bullying, 
Quitting Is Easy – Even for Champions
David tried finding a way out in Air Force training, dreaming of becoming a Pararescue.
Unfortunately, even though everything was going great for a while, David was supposed to complete his training by gaining some water confidence, i.e., completing a course during which they try to drown you for weeks; and he wasn’t that good at swimming or comfortable under water.
So, he quit, using a routine medical check-up (which showed that he has a predisposition to sickle cell anemia) as an excuse to do so.
The point?
It’s always easy to find an excuse, even if you’re a champion; but, as they say, if you want to succeed, instead of excuses, you’ll find ways.
With the Right Mindset and a Lot of Hard Work, You Can Do It Too
David Goggins found them: he’s now considered one of the fittest men on this planet.
How did he do it?
With the right mindset and a lot of hard work.

Unfortunately, we didn’t get the chance to cover everything Chip, and his amazing wife Joanna had been through.
But, we tried to be lethal in the delivery of their life-story, which will undoubtedly spark something inside you.
Let’s have a glimpse of the stupid stuff, that turned the tables around!
Who Should Read “Capital Gaines”? And Why?
The strange thing about this book is that it encompasses so many aspects of our daily lives.
Among other things, 
 also puts in the spotlight the entrepreneurial fire and attitude nurtured by Chip and Joanna. 
As a reader, you’ll find what it takes to succeed in the real world, and how to deal with the challenges life throws at you!
If you are ready to face the music, then this book comes as a blessing in disguise. 
About Chip Gaines
 is the co-owner and co-founder of Magnolia Homes.
He earned his bachelor degree from Baylor University in marketing. People often say that he started more small businesses than you can count on your fingers.
But it would be imprudent not to mention his loving and combative wife – 
!
Alongside her, he co-wrote “
.”
“Capital Gaines PDF Summary”
In the first chapter, Chip recaps his childhood and mentions that he was a normal kid, like everybody else. But, there is an unexplored mystery behind “being normal” so let’s dive in!
The first-grade teachers in his school divided the class into four reading groups. 
At that time, Chip didn’t see anything strange in that; it was just a bunch of teams bearing cool names. 
He doesn’t remember everything, but he recalls that when it was his time to read, the rest of the kids were ushered out while he remained in the classroom.
You get the idea.
Perhaps, some of the other kids made fun of him, but Chip looked at life through a set of rosy lens.
When it was his time to hit the gym with the rest of his classmates, he didn’t feel embarrassed but honored, to say the least. 
Perhaps, the 
 come to us from ill-defined evaluation concepts or individuals who were widely misrepresented in their early years.
In his mid-twenties, Chip was taking part in three different businesses, and as a self-thought owner, he really had it going. His best buddies were a group of Mexicans, who he believed are the embodiment of the hard-working mentality.
The biggest problem he faced, while working with them was the language barrier.
At one point, he would even mix English and Spanish to create a brand new language, making everyone more confused than before.
Chip had enough and decided to go to Mexico and learn Spanish.
His girlfriend was really supportive, unlike his parents who advised him that running three businesses is more than enough.
And yes, upon leaving the States and heading over to Mexico, problems began to pile up.
Joanna (his girlfriend) wasn’t ready to take on the responsibility of running his business or keep it afloat should you prefer, without him. When the time came to collect the rents from the students, she was in for a big surprise.
Chip “forgot” to tell her how much begging is required to get it done.
Mr. Stevens (Joanna’s dad) even had contractors storming into his office, people who demanded their money. Joanna was quick of study, and immediately called his parents, and went there for dinner. They managed to access Chip’s bank account, lend him some money in order to cover the incurring expenses.
The crisis was over, and Chip got away thanks to the brilliance of his girlfriend and parents.
Let’s go back for a second!
When Chip was 26, he met Joanna for the very first time. Probably he had goosebumps, the minute he laid eyes upon her, and somehow thought that she is the type of girl he would like to date.
She was intriguing and unique, which made Chip want to spend time with her.
After the first couple of dates, he didn’t plan on tying the knot, neither did she, but it was a great transition for a guy that didn’t have plenty of serious relationships.
When they got married, Chip and Joanna unlike most of the couples, had the support of both parents on both sides.
You would often hear people say – opposites attract, and that statement couldn’t get any truer regarding their relationship.
Chip was that risk-taking kind of guy, who looked at rules as an opportunity to break them, while Joanna was quiet and soft.
His time in Mexico was all Joanna needed to help Chip gain stability over his businesses. 
Chip even declares that he doesn’t know whether Joanna felt sorry for him and jumped on board, or simply didn’t want to throw away the time and effort she put in while he was gone.
With that said, she became his secret weapon.
A girl who knew how to set things straight!
As their relationship grew stronger, they learned how to play on each other’s aptitudes. 
One being down to earth and the other being a dreamer, who occasionally overlooked the numbers. And by now, you probably know which one is which!
Probably, the greatest challenge they faced was to refrain from talking about business at home. 
And this might not seem like a big deal, but it was harder than it looks.
Having the time to spend in the effort to grow as a family, wasn’t easy at all!
After a couple of fights, they kind of had this breakthrough which was composed of cutting the other enough slack to get the ball rolling. 
Is there a better way to organize your life than to have a lifelong companion who is there to back you up no matter what?
This frantic lifestyle gave little room to catch a breather, and in the process, Chip learned a lot.
One of the things he deems are ultra important, is to take into account all opinions.
You can’t run a business while neglecting other people’s perspective, and the same goes when forging a relationship with another human being.
That inner voice that just can’t seem to go away is where the magic comes from!
It takes a bit of practice to get good at it, and nobody is saying that it’s going to be an easy battle!
Now it’s time to Grow!
Chip argues that fear was never a major factor in his 
. He and Joanna understood that when you are not trying to avoid failure, fear loses its grip and vanishes in the air.
However, one cannot simply believe that fear is solely associated with failure.
Sometimes, we dread the idea of talking to someone, or placing our faith in that person’s hands!
By all means, at given times it’s okay to feel skeptical, but that mustn’t become the driving factor.
And yes, life isn’t always cheerful, but even the setback can be construed as an adventure rather than fear.
Nobody is saying that you should disavow your past, but you should not push the panic button just yet.
Let’s tell you a quick story!
One day, Jo was dropping the kids off at school and had a vision.
She caught sight of two obsolete silos, looming out of the shadows.
Can you imagine if we put all of our business in one spot? – She said. Chip really liked the idea, because they could expand their office and workspace, and the kids’ school was just across the street.
Yet, the price of the property was substantial, and they knew that revamping the old buildings from the ground up will take considerable effort and money.
The financial risk was by no means small; to them, this was the biggest project they’ve ever undertaken.
Chip, the wild risk-taker suddenly felt a surge of adrenaline mixed with fear. 
If the project isn’t successful, they would probably 
.
However, one great analogy helped Chip see the big picture. According to this philosophy, the win-lose mindset is just made-up idiocy. 
Sometimes, one step back leads to two-step forward in the long haul, which means that you must be able to discern differences between temporary setbacks or hurdles and giving up.
If you are compelled to take chances, bet on yourself! 
You might not always win, but if you don’t try how would you know which side you’re on?
The bottom line is – people who have that winner’s edge, or winning mentality should not be afraid of the unforeseeable future. Because no matter, where life winds take you, you’ll always be on the right side.
Along the way, you’ll face some hurdles, but you will never feel defeated!
And that’s the magic of success.
While at it, Chip doesn’t fail to mention the hilarious side of things.
Sometimes it’s demanding to be funny while the cameras are rolling because you lose the momentum while preparing for the act. 
So, no – Chip doesn’t want you to feel sorry for him; he just points out that withstanding pressure is part of the daily job.
Those people who succumb to fear are okay to work for a system and prefer to be burden-free.
The 9 to 5:00 daily grind is what they want!
Chip is not in that category! He loves to create something from scratch, and take all the responsibility for stuff that might go both ways.
Perhaps, that’s why the TV audience resonates with the message both he and Jo, are trying to convey.
No matter what, they endeavor to lit the hearts of those who want to burst the bubble of mediocrity.
Key Lessons from “Capital Gaines”
1.      Don’t be afraid of the dark
2.      Keep your head up
3.      Defeat doesn’t mean failure
Don’t be afraid of the dark
Kids are afraid of the Boogieman, while the grown-ups try to anticipate the future, and take appropriate precautions to minimize risk.
Although that’s a natural response, we feel like you can do a lot better.
Just keep believing in yourself, and go into the unknown.
Keep your head up
It’s true that proper action can forestall a bigger catastrophe.
With that said, it’s not always possible to be at your best and act within the confines of flawlessness.
Therefore, try to keep your morale high, even when things take an unexpected turn for the worse.
Defeat doesn’t mean failure
Walking through life, and having an unobscured winning streak is not hard but impossible.
You have to practice your losing response, and get back on your feet as quickly as possible.
Therefore, it’s crucial not to perceive every stumbling block as an insurmountable obstacle.

 was an American lecturer and bestselling author, one of the pioneers in the fields of self-improvement, corporate training, and public speaking guidance.
A poor farmer’s son, Dale Carnegie dreamt of becoming a lecturer ever since his childhood years, but after finding a little success as an actor in the years before the First World War, he went nearly broke.
It was then that he got an idea to teach a course on public speaking which was a success and resulted in the publication of 
in 1926.
His crowning achievement came a decade later when Simon & Schuster published 
, one of the all-time self-improvement classics; something similar can be said about 
, first published in 1948.
“The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking PDF Summary”
First published in 1962, 
is often marketed as the fourth revision of 
Dale Carnegie’s famous 1926 textbook which went through more than fifty printings in the next three decades and was translated into no less than 11 languages.
However, this fourth revision is different than the previous three in at least two ways:
• First and foremost – and most obvious in view of the fact that Dale Carnegie died in 1955, – this revision wasn’t made by him: instead, it was made by his wife Dorothy, based on her husband’s notes and ideas;
• And secondly, it is such a substantial revision that it is difficult to consider it as merely a version of 
; it’s nothing less than a completely different book. 
And will be treated as such.
Divided into five parts and fourteen chapters, the book is both an introduction to public speaking and a manual for mastering it.
Though its examples may be a bit outdated, they are delivered in an easy-to-read language and reveal a theoretical framework for the ages.
Part One: Fundamentals of Effective Speaking
In the chapters that make up the first part of this book, Dale and Dorothy Carnegie “discuss the basic principles of effective speaking and the attitudes to make these principles come alive.”
“In order to get the most out of this book,” writes Dale Carnegie in the Introduction to the first chapter of the first part of his book, “and to get it with rapidity and dispatch, you will find these four guideposts useful:” 
As you have heard it quite a few times just from us, 
 and, even if it isn’t, 
 
“There is no such animal, in or out of captivity, as a born public speaker,” writes Carnegie straightforwardly right off the bat.
In other words – as is the case with every single sphere of human endeavor – you can learn to become a public speaker; quite probably, in much, much less than 10,000 hours (
).
The reason why there were periods of time when there were many more public speakers than today is, simply put, because public speaking was considered important and was part of the curriculum. 
Nothing more, nothing less.
According to Dale Carnegie, 
, Harvard’s most distinguished professor of psychology, said it best when he said:
Carnegie describes these six sentences as “the open sesame to Ali Baba’s treasure cave of courage.” 
“Life’s battles don’t always go to the stronger or faster man,” wrote poet Walter D. Wintle a century ago, “but sooner or later the man who wins is the man who thinks he can.”
That’s Dale Carnegie’s third guidepost for success: predetermine your mind to it.
How?
Take a lesson from Caesar and burn your ships after crossing Dover; now, with the last means of retreat burned, you’d have no choice but to conquer England.
OK, that title is pretty self-explanatory.
Overcoming stage fright and developing confidence is not that difficult and you shouldn’t consider it an insurmountable obstacle to your success as a public speaker; you just need a few weeks of practice.
And these four pieces of advice.
Never forget these four facts about public speaking:
• You are not unique in your fear of speaking in public;
• A certain amount of stage fright is useful: it is nature’s way of preparing us to meet unusual challenges in our environment;
• Many professional speakers never completely lose all stage fright;
• The chief cause of your fear of public speaking is simply that you are unaccustomed to speak in public.
Daniel Webster said once that he’d sooner appear before an audience half-clothed than half-prepared; and Lincoln mused that he should never be old enough to speak without embarrassment when he has nothing to say.
In other words: only the prepared ones can be confident.
And they can do this by:
• Never memorizing a talk word for word;
• Assembling and arranging their 
 beforehand; and
• Rehearsing their talk with their friends.
A piece of repeated advice, but, then again, a justly repeated one.
Just follow these simple rules to do so:
• Lose yourself in your subject;
• Keep your attention off negative stimuli that may upset you;
• Give yourself a pep talk.
Your adaptive unconscious can’t really make the difference between actual and mimicked feelings and actions.
In other words: 
.
These are the three cardinal rules for a quick and easy way to learn to speak in public:
This is the rule you’ll hear repeated most often as Lesson #1 from this book. 
Tell your listeners what life has taught you and be sure to look for topics in your background.
That’s the best way to conquer your fears and earn confidence.
Of course, not everything you 
 talk about is something you 
talk about. And great public speakers deliver their speeches with passion and fervor. So, be excited about your topic.
Part Two: Speech, Speaker, and Audience
This part discusses the speech triangle: speech/speaker/audience.
“There are four ways to develop speech material that guarantees audience attention,” writes Dale Carnegie. “If you follow these four steps in your preparation you will be well on the way to commanding the eager attention of your listeners.”
“You must limit and select before you begin, narrow your subject down to an area that will fit the time at your disposal.”
Follow this simple rule-of-thumb:
• In a short talk – around 5 minutes – you have time to go over one or two points;
• In a longer talk – between 5 and 30 minutes – you have time to go over four or five main ideas.
After narrowing your subject, now it’s time to ask yourself some difficult questions about it and get about ten or a hundred times as much information as what you’d actually use in the end.
This is what Dale Carnegie refers to as “reserve power.”
Do this by following these five rules:
• Humanize your talk;
• Personalize your talk by using names;
• Be specific – feel your talk with details;
• Dramatize your talk by using dialogue;
• Visualize by demonstrating what you are talking about.
We do not think in generals – but in particulars; take a lesson from Shakespeare, and instead of saying “superfluous,” say something like “to gild refined gold, to paint the lily, to throw perfume on the violet.”
And that comes from
, one of his worst plays.
“If a speaker believes a thing earnestly enough and says it earnestly enough,” Carnegie says, “he will get adherents to his cause, even though he claims he can produce bluegrass from dust and ashes.”
You know why you watch movies? 
Because they allow you to satisfy your need for emotional expressiveness.
Offer that to your audience.
Acting in earnest will make you feel earnest. Remember that.
Speaking of feelings and your relationship with the audience – here are a few rules that will help you to build up “a strong feeling of rapport with your listeners:”
Visualize your audience as eager to hear what you have to say; otherwise, you’ll think that you’re boring your audience and you’ll find your listeners restless and hopefully looking to the exit doors.
This helps nobody.
Don’t tell your audience that is the most intelligent you have ever addressed or that you love each and every one of them; be exactly one hundred percent sincere with them. Hollow flattery may work in the short-term, but in the long-term – gets you nowhere.
Once again, self-explanatory: say “we” when you start feeling that the “you” creates a space between you and the audience.
Ask questions, be 
, use a little showmanship!
“An audience is quick in taking the measure of a speaker who assumes that he is superior in mental accomplishment or in social standing,” writes Carnegie. “Indeed, one of the best ways for a speaker to endear himself to an audience is to play himself down.”
Part Three: The Purpose of Prepared and Impromptu Talks
In part three, the Carnegies develop in detail two methods of delivering a talk: the extemporaneous (aka prepared) one and the impromptu method.
The impromptu method aside, you need to know that every talk, regardless of whether the speaker realizes it or not, has one of four major goals:
• To persuade or get action;
• To inform;
• To impress and convince; or
• To entertain.
The following chapters analyze each – but the entertaining one – of these goal-oriented talks in detail.
If you want to persuade or get action through your speech, be short and straight to the point.
Also:
• Build your example upon a single personal experience;
• Start your talk with a detail of your example;
• Fill your example with relevant detail;
• Relive your experience as you relate it.
• Make the point brief and specific;
• Make the point easy for listeners to do;
• State the point with force and conviction.
• Be sure the reason is relevant to the example
• Be sure to stress one reason—and one only
If you want to be merely informative in your talk, then you should always have in 
: “Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly. Everything that can be said can be said clearly.”
Also, you should follow these rules:
This is always important – but 
 if you want to be informative.
See below: this works great when you enumerate.
First of all, because one can follow much better if you enumerate for him your points.
Secondly, because he/she will remember better if you follow this strategy.
Thirdly – and lastly – because it always works.
To do this:
• Turn a fact into a picture; and
• Avoid technical terms
.
Getting a favorable reaction is every speaker’s objective at any time, anywhere. However, sometimes, this is the main goal.
If that’s what you want to achieve, these five advices by Carnegie should be more then helpful.
According to the ancients, the orator was nothing less than “a good man skilled in speaking.” And when it’s your purpose to convince someone, then you better try to say something that you believe in. 
You must be sincerely convinced in what you’ll attempt to convince others; otherwise, you probably won’t.
Don’t argue with your audience: even in arguments, there’s always some common ground. Start from there.
Reason alone hasn’t convinced anyone ever; you must deeply believe in what you say, and you must express it in a way that will demonstrate this belief. Reason wins minds; contagious enthusiasm wins hearts. The latter works better, smoother, and faster.
But – be sincere while doing this; neither underestimate nor overestimate them.
Let’s face it: so many things depend on the first impression; that’s why it’s essential that you begin in a friendly way.
Someone – a jazz-musician, we think – once said that he spends a lot more time preparing for his improvisations than for anything else. 
Have that in mind if you are interested in giving impromptu talks: they don’t come by themselves.
To be able to give the impromptu speech when it really matters, prepare yourself by giving impromptu speeches when it doesn’t; nothing comes out of nothing, wrote Shakespeare; he might as well had practicing in mind when he wrote that.
You must be mentally ready to speak impromptu; don’t start an impromptu speech if you feel fear even in the tiniest amount; it doesn’t work that way.
There are three reasons why you should do this:
• It is freeing;
• It will get you into “the swing of speaking;”
• You will enlist the attention of your audience at once.
To quote Carnegie, “throw yourself with abandon into your talk, and you will help to insure your success as an impromptu speaker.”
There are three sources from which you can get ideas for an impromptu speech:
• 
; talk about them and use an example they should know;
• 
; there’s a need for an impromptu speech when there are more than just a few guys around; surely you can talk about how that happened, right?
• 
; be an attentive listener and link your speech to something someone has said before you.
That’s a nice way to point out the difference between merely talking about something and giving a talk; the former is formless; the latter has structure; jot it in your mind before starting the speech.
Part Four: The Art of Communicating
Part four is dedicated in its entirety to the subject of delivery, and it contains merely one short chapter.
“There are four ways – and only four ways – in which we have contact with the world,” says Carnegie at the beginning of this chapter. “We are evaluated and classified by these four contacts: what we do, how we look, what we say, and how we say it.” 
This chapter deals with the last of these – “how we say” things; you’ll say them better if you follow these five rules:
#1. Crash through your shell of self-consciousness
#2. Don’t try to imitate others – be yourself
#3. Converse with your audience
#4. Put your heart into your speaking
#5. Practice making your voice strong and flexible 
Part Five: The Challenge of Effective Speaking
The final part of 
relates the principles and techniques already laid out in the previous four parts to everyday speaking, from social conversations to a formal public address.
Carnegie has these five suggestions to help you make a well-organized speech of introduction:
Just taking a little time to prepare should save you the embarrassment of saying something that will nowadays go viral. (
.)
Use the T-I-S Formula as a handy guide. It’s an acronym:
• 
; “start your introduction by giving the exact title of the speaker’s talk;”
• 
 
; “in this step bridge over the area between the topic and the particular interests of the group;”
• 
; “here you list the speaker’s outstanding qualifications, particularly those that relate to his topic. Finally, you give his name, distinctly and clearly.”
How would you like to be presented? Enthusiastically, of course. Well, be enthusiastic when presenting another one.
That’s a given.
This goes for all the presenters out there; but we guess all of them already know this.
As you know full well because of the music at the Academy Awards, the acceptance speech should be even shorter than the speech of presentation. And, whatever you do – don’t exaggerate. Even if he exists, God probably has more important stuff on his mind, so no need to thank him, ha?
It’s insane to start building a house without some sort of a plan; it’s just as ridiculous to start delivering a longer talk without a vague notion of what you want to accomplish.
And just like in the case of house-building, there are time-tested methods for each phase of organization when it comes to longer talks:
How?
This is the way:
• Begin your talk with an incident—example arouse suspense
• State an arresting fact
• Ask for a show of hands
• Promise to tell the audience how they can get something they want
• Use an exhibit
Contrary to popular opinion:
• Do not open with an apology;
• Avoid the “funny” story opening;
Here are four ways you can do that:
• Use statistics;
• Use the testimony of experts;
• Use analogies; and/or
• Use a demonstration with or without an exhibit.
This is how all of your speeches should end:
• Summarize
• Ask for Action
The fourteenth chapter of 
advises its readers to start applying what they have learned from this book to everyday conversations, so they become masters when it really matters.
Here are the five techniques to do this:
#1. Use specific detail in everyday conversation
#2. Use effective speaking techniques in your job
#3. Seek opportunities to speak in public
#4. You must persist
#5. Keep the certainty of reward before you

3.      The Four Facts About Fear of Speaking in Public
Talk About Things You Have Earned the Right to Talk About
Public speakers are not born – but made; in other words, you can become one.
The key advice: always talk about things you have earned the right to talk about, be it from experience or knowledge, or preferably, both.
Also: be excited about what you are planning to talk about. It’s one thing to 
 to talk about something, and a completely different thing to actually 
 to talk about that thing.
Always Have Your Goal in Mind When Delivering a Public Speech: It’s One of These Four
All speeches have one or more of these goals:
• To persuade or get action;
• To inform;
• To impress and convince; or
• To entertain.
Always have your goal before you and never steer away from it; think of your speech as a house: you’d never build one without a plan, would you?
The Four Facts About Fear of Speaking in Public
When you talk about something you really know and love – 
– you’ll be confident enough to consider yourself practically fearless.
These four facts about fear of speaking in public should help you as well:

On the morning of April 29, 1986, “the most difficult fire in the history of Los Angeles” destroyed over one million priceless books in the Los Angeles Public Library.
Susan Orlean’s 
tells the full story.
Until it’s not anymore a story about a fire – but a story about libraries and books and memory and what it means to be a human being.
Who Should Read “The Library Book”? And Why?
If you love the smell of napalm… oh, sorry – old books in the morning; if you prefer a cozy afternoon with a novel tucked under a blanket to a crazy night at a techno club; if you’ve got an allergy to dust, and yet can’t help visiting the local library at least once a week ever since your student days – then 
 will strike a few chords in your heart
“A dazzling love letter to a beloved institution” and “an investigation into one of its greatest mysteries” (
), 
is the book for every book lover out there; especially the hundreds of thousands of members of the Los Angeles Public Library.
About Susan Orlean

“The Library Book PDF Summary”
“In Senegal,” writes Susan Orlean at the end of Chapter 8 of 
,
“the polite expression for saying someone died is to say his or her library has burned.”
And then she goes on:
Now, if each individual is a private library, then actual libraries are nothing less than the DNA of a whole culture, if not the human civilization itself.
And that’s why Susan Orlean’s extraordinary book, 
, turns from an investigation of the great 1986 Los Angeles Public Library fire into “an exercise in mining her intense feelings” for the subject of books and libraries (to quote 
’ review for 
).
It’s almost as if she uses the fire, Lewis says, as a MacGuffin, “a trick for luring the reader into a subject into which the reader never imagined he’d be lured: the history and present life of the Los Angeles Central Library.”
“Susan Orlean’s new book,” says 
, “is like exploring the stacks of a library, where something unexpected and interesting can be discovered on every page.”
Here are the bits which impressed us the most.
The “Extraordinary and Unforgettable” Fire
Unbeknownst to many at the time, April 29, 1986, was the day of “one of the biggest fires in the history of Los Angeles;” coincidentally, it was also “the single biggest library fire in the history of the United States.”
And it consumed large parts of the Central Library in downtown Los Angeles. 
To this day, nobody knows what and why had caused it; but many LA firefighters still remember it the most uncommon and fiercest fire they ever had to face.
“It was a huge, furious fire that burned for more than seven hours and reached temperatures of 2000 degrees,” informs us Orlean. 
It wasn’t red and orange and yellow and black, but colorless and somewhere pale blue; it was so hot that it appeared icy; three decades later, Ron Hamel, then-captain in the fire department, remembers that everybody around him thought that they were looking at the bowels of hell.
More than fifty firefighters were injured while trying to put out the fire; over 400,000 books were completely and irretrievably destroyed; at least 700,000 more were substantially damaged.
And yet – 
Even if you were living in LA at the time, you probably wouldn’t have heard much about this.
Because around the same time, about 10,000km to the east, a nuclear reactor melted down in Chernobyl, causing not only environmental concerns but also a stock market crash.
In fact, 
didn’t even bother to mention to fire until a day after; and even then, it was just a brief story published on page A14, laying out the basic facts and sharing the opinions of a few local residents.
Chernobyl won. 
“The books burned,” writes Orlean, “while most of us were waiting to see if we were about to witness the end of the world.”
The Act of Burning Books
As we said above, nobody knows, to this day, who or what had caused the 1986 fire in the Los Angeles Public Library.
The main – and basically only – suspect was a struggling attention-seeking actor named Harry Peak; but he was let go soon after being imprisoned due to lack of evidence.
During the fire, everything in the Fiction section from A through L was destroyed; consequently, that included all of Ray Bradbury’s books, including the one you’re inclined to think about every time book burning is mentioned, 
.
Orlean uses the fire and the loss of over one million invaluable books to ask some important questions about the nature of books and about the act of burning them.
If it was Harry Peak or another arsonist who had caused the fire, why did he do it?
And there’s a reason for that: humans, just as that Senegalese phrase quoted above suggests, are pretty much like books.
“Taking books away from a culture is to take away its shared memory,” writes Orlean. “It’s like taking away the ability to remember your dreams. Destroying a culture’s books is sentencing it to something worse than death: It is sentencing it to seem as if it never lived.”
Building Libraries Is Not Unlike Building Civilizations
is a love letter not only to the Los Angeles Public Library but to public libraries everywhere on the planet.
At least as far as Orlean is concerned, they are, in a way, not only the reason why we can call ourselves civilized but also the embodiment of hope, the symbol of the power of the human connection.
“The library is a whispering post,” says Orlean both poetically and powerfully: 
Orlean admits that after thinking about this, she realized that the very existence of 
owes everything to this kind of reasoning.
We always write because we hope that we’ll be able “to tell a long-lasting story, to create something that endured, to be alive somehow as long as someone would read [our stories].”
In view of this, it’s not an exaggeration to say that libraries are our most powerful weapon against Death and Hate, the pinnacle of our attempt to create a global human civilization.
The Google of Days Past: Let’s Just Call the Library
When you have a dilemma or a question nowadays, you ask Google about it.
Well, until not that long ago, in similar cases, people had no choice but to contact libraries’ reference departments. 
The one in LA’s Central Library was called SCAN, short for the Southern California Answering Network and was pretty popular both locally and nationally.
Here are some of the records:
•
•
Even today, the phones in the library constantly ring: not everybody knows how to use the Internet.
Here’s a funny reaction overheard by Orlean just recently after one such call: “Why would someone call here and ask, ‘Which is more evil, grasshoppers or crickets?’”
A Few Interesting People
There are many exceptionally interesting people who populate the pages of 
One of them Harry Peak, the guy accused of starting the fire. Tall, blond, and dimpled, Peak was nothing short of a fantasist, “a storyteller, a yarn-spinner, and an agile liar.”
He was so good and quick at imagining and fabricating stories about his life that, according to his sister, even his family didn’t believe a word he says.
Case in point: after admitting to starting the fire, Harry offered no fewer than seven different alibis; many firefighters believed none of them he was arrested but not indicted.
Here he is after his release from jail.
Gene Scott is another colorful character which appears on the pages of Orlean’s book, a Stanford Ph.D. and a pastor, “the most agnostic believer and the most believing agnostic.” 
However, neither his cigar-smoking sermons backed by scantily clad women nor the telethon he organized to raise millions for the library’s reconstruction compares to one of LA’s early librarians, Mr. Charles Fletcher Lummis, “a journalist, poet, editor, historian, and adventurer.”
And, oh, so much more!
, but here are three things we couldn’t help but sharing with you now:
• The man wanted to improve the tastes of LA citizens; to do so, he hired a blacksmith to make “branding iron in the shape of a skull and crossbones” which he then used to brand the frontispiece of pseudoscientific books;
• He created a group of alt-librarians who are not “pompous asses;” he called the group 
, aka “Librarians Who Are Nevertheless Human;” each member had a Bibliosmiles nickname; Lummis’ was “Grim Reality;”
• Outside the library, Lummis often organized lavish parties for writers at his house called El Alisal; yup, they included troubadours and prostitutes!

2.      Books and Libraries, the Cultural DNA
3.      How to Steal a Book: the Hollywood Edition
The 1986 Los Angeles Public Library Fire
On April 29, 1986, three days after the Chernobyl Disaster, the Central Public Library in Los Angeles caught fire, one of the biggest in the history of Los Angeles.
Since the library was built before architects knew enough about ventilation of heat and smoke, the fire was both difficult to put out and devastating.
“Almost every firefighter in Los Angeles was called upon to fight the fire,” and yet – it took them more than seven hours to put it out.
The cost?
More than 50 firefighters were injured, and more than one million books were either destroyed or damaged.
Even though a wannabe actor was blamed for it – a certain Harry Peak – to this day, it is not known who or what had caused it.
Books and Libraries, the Cultural DNA
Remember 
?
Of course you do: it’s Ray Bradbury’s dystopian novel, the most famous one treating the topic of book burning.
If you have read it – or watched Francois Truffaut’s adaptation – you know that by the end of the story, books and people become indistinguishable: to save the civilization from destruction, and build it anew when it becomes necessary, intellectuals have started memorizing important classics by heart.
Orlean highlights countless times the fact that this is more than a metaphor or a recipe for a new society:
By the way – and suitably – Orlean uses a sentence from 
 as an epigraph to her book: “And when they ask us what we’re doing, you can say, 
”
How to Steal a Book: the Hollywood Edition
Among the many interesting stories inside Susan Orlean’s book, there’s one that really caught our attention.
Namely, it seems that, contrary to what you’d expect, the poor and the disillusioned weren’t the ones the library officials feared when it came to the subject of stealing books.
Fascinatingly enough – the greatest threat was Hollywood. “For years,” writes Orlean, “movie studios were major book-pinching culprits.” 
Why would they do that?
Two main reasons:
#1. There was no Internet at the time, and the libraries were the only place where screenwriters could find material for their research;
#2. When you check out a book, there’s a due date to return it – and you don’t want scheduling conflicts which could cause you millions because of administration, do you?
How did they do it?
It was a simple scheme, involving two assistants, one of which would take a position outside a window with the other pitching the desired book out to window to his accomplice. 
And this happened so often that the library had to hire an employee whose main job was to regularly visit film studios and get the stolen books back.
Also, the library had no choice but to wire shut all the windows most often used for the scheme.
Hollywood! Go figure!

Moreover, you’ll read the candid conversations between the author and her friends, family, and blog readers.
The book is split into six segments, starting with “Self-knowledge”. We need to understand ourselves better to build a solid foundation for changing and implementing habits tailored to our individual lives.

As a top tip, you should know that:
Rubin provides us with several theories to help build habits for a happier life:
: Indulging once in a while is relatively safe if you’ve got restraint. However, if you don’t, one bite won’t diminish your appetite; on the contrary, your “one tiny treat” tends to become “many tiny treats”. That’s the road to self-loathing and severe consequences for your body. So next time you feel tense or under the weather, skip the vanilla ice cream or that big jar of Nutella.
: It 
 be done responsibly if we impose limits. When we indulge in the thrill of the chase for various bargains, things (and that I mean time and money) can get out of hand, fast.
Even if most of the time we’re happy when shopping, the endless circle of that short-lived happiness, the subsequent buyer’s remorse, and more shopping to make us feel better is a very hard one to break. 
: TV tends to be a go-to activity when we come home from work. Sometimes we stay glued to the glowing screen until late at night, feeling slightly guilty whenever Netflix asks if we’re 
 watching; sometimes we doze off in front of it.

Still, television is considered a treat when you have a favorite show that you watch weekly; you view it as a friend or a family member, and you feel invigorated after the episode is over.

‘, Tony Hsieh tells the story of his company, Zappos, and demonstrates how long-term thinking and pursuing his passions generate not only profits but also a happy life for its employees, clients and himself. In this book, Tony describes an approach to creating a corporate culture focused on making people around him happy and thereby increasing their happiness.
To build a great company, it is essential to find out what you love to do. This microbook is recommended for anyone interested in conducting a successful business and learning how a company focused on extraordinary customer service, employee happiness, and profitability can coexist. Let’s go?
Discovering What You Love To Do
In both life and business, you will inevitably come up against success and failure. But what matters is finding out the thing for which you are genuinely in love. Understanding your passion is important because it simplifies all the decisions you have to make. That allows you to always have a definite goal in mind.
For example, let’s say you are an entrepreneur who has been offered an excellent opportunity to sell your business. If you know you’re passionate about your business and love the satisfaction it gives you, the decision to decline offers is easy.
A passion for what you do is more important than making lots of money doing things that you hate. That is why, first of all, you must decide if you will meet the challenge of stopping focusing on just the money and start pursuing your passion.
One way to find it is to venture into many different things to see what works. At the very least, these experiments will show you what you do not want to do. The more things you eliminate from your list, the more you will know about yourself and the easier it will be to find your real passion. The closer you get to find it, the less likely you are to go after wrong dreams."
Purple Cow PDF Summary,https://blog.12min.com/purple-cow-pdf-summary/,,"5 min read ⌚ 
A purple cow doesn’t come from Switzerland – as you may think at a first sight of the title of this book. But may lead some of your future incomes there – joking…or not.
It – the purple cow – comes from your fearless ideas that went natural on the market and achieved some “wow, that’s really something” while being noticed by customers.
Don’t try to figure it out by yourself how to do that. Seth Godin gives you really helpful tips and we’ve already selected great tips from his book.
Being remarkable means not being afraid to stand out. 
’s book, Purple Cow, will let you know how and, more importantly, why you should want to stand out.
Seth Godin is a well-known writer, entrepreneur, marketer,  and public speaker. His books address topics like marketing and advertising, leadership or the way ideas spread.
“Purple Cow Summary”
Purple Cow focuses on remarkable marketing and offers a fresh approach to advertising.
‘s marketing strategy targets the new fast going consumers that are too busy to pay attention to advertising.
For the new type of consumers, there is only one new strategy that will get them to seek out a product.
This strategy is the Purple Cow.
In 
’s own words,
The main idea of the book is that in order for a product to get the consumers’ attention, it needs to be remarkable. If it doesn’t stand out, it will be as invisible as the rest of the products already surrounding us.
But how do you get a product to stand out? By building what is worth noticing directly into the product. Building a remarkable product will make it stand out.
This way 
You should also focus on not trying to create a product for everyone.
Doing so will eventually lead to having a product for nobody. You need to find a market niche and create a remarkable product for that target.
Why do we need the Purple Cow in the first place? As there are more and more choices for consumers, it’s harder to get them to buy a new kind of any existing products.
Your audience gets smaller and smaller, and among the people that might buy your product, most will never hear about it.
Also, as the existing products already offer consumers what they need, there is a small chance that any new product could deliver something that will add to customers’ satisfaction.
Another reason for which a new marketing strategy is necessary is what Seth Godin calls the death of the TV-Industrial Complex.
When the system worked, the TV ads used to guarantee retail distribution and 
.
Consumers believed that having a product advertised on TV was the proof of its quality.
We need the Purple Cow because the post TV age needs new 
.
As the old rules no longer apply, when you realize that the future of a product will not be remarkable, it’s safer to stop investing in it and start building something new.
Although the Purple Cow doesn’t have the same domination the TV ads used to have, it’s clear that this strategy is the best chance a product has.
The Purple Cow is the key to success. This means that you need to 
t.
You need to be investing in the Purple Cow.
You need to invest in products, services, and techniques that are so useful and interesting, that the market will want to listen to what you have to say. You must develop products, services, and techniques that the market will actually seek out.
As stated at the beginning, being remarkable means not being afraid to stand out. This is the problem with the Purple Cow …fear.
Starting with our early school education, we learn that the safe thing is to follow the rules and fit in. This way we can avoid failure.
Unfortunately, 
.
We also believe that criticism leads to failure. So we will do whatever it takes to avoid being criticized, even choose to be boring (and safe).
We need to realize that playing it safe is the worst strategy one can take. We don’t have to hide from criticism.
Why not? First of all, because having your project criticized doesn’t mean you are being criticized as well.
Second, it turns out that people who have projects that are never criticized are the ones who ultimately fail.
As most people believe that the best way is to play it safe, the reward for making something amazing is great grate. Being the Purple Cow brings huge benefits.
The leader on a market is the leader because he did something remarkable and took the risk of standing out. He is the leader because he is the Purple Cow.
Although there is no formula for creating a Purple Cow, there is a good advice that Seth Godin shares with his readers.
His advice is to go for the edges.
To challenge yourself and your team to describe what those edges are. And then test which edge is most likely to deliver the marketing and financial results you seek.
We learned that the world changed and that the old rules of marketing no longer apply. So what happens in marketing?
The answer is simple – marketing also changed. It now refers to everything. It refers to:
Creating a Purple Cow isn’t easy. But if you feel like you have what it takes to develop something remarkable, you should dare to go further. You could start by reading the book and discover everything you need to know about the Purple Cow. Don’t be afraid to stand out. After all…

That means that if you turn 9 on January the 2
, you will be playing the whole year with 8-year-old colleagues. This gives you a huge advantage over your friend that will turn 9 in December, for example.
You have one year advantage in physical strength, speed, accuracy and you will probably be seen as one of the “talented” ones.

In this case, even the month you were born has a major impact on your success. The author adds it perfectly.
Malcolm Gladwell spent the majority of his time analyzing and searching for theories which were a complete opposite of the collective societal opinion. He also criticized the U.S educational system, alluding to many weakness which the government just ignores.
“Outliers” as the name indicates is a paranormal book according to some people, although this may seem like a negative comment – it is not.
Where is the beauty of typical behavior? – We assist Gladwell in the battle against mediocracy, and you should start that fight too.
In one of Gladwell’s recent speeches, he declared that – People’s opinion about success is imposed. We lack individuals; we have a society. Hard work, ambition, struggle are not the only elements of success. 
 has a task to clarify this mystery by introducing the readers to lots of variable measurements of professional or personal prosperity.
No one dares to admit that even the wealthy people are often depressive – so are you calling that a success?
Our culture has a tremendous impact on our behavior; we mustn’t allow getting ourselves trapped in the circle of nations. Be a person of the world – see things clearly and let Gladwell and 
 guide you.
In football is the same. If you want to reinforce this idea, just try a Google search on your national under-19 football team. Count how many players are born in the first half of the year, and how many in the second.
 By the time the computer revolution came around 1975, one should have been old enough to be part of it, but not too young to miss it. Ideally one should have been 20 or 21.

. It’s the magical number that every successful person invested in achieving success. In any field, with no exception.

 In its chapters, the author describes why our backgrounds are important and can be a prediction of one’s success.
Why coming from a Jewish family that immigrated to the USA, had a big influence on you becoming a well-known lawyer.
In “Harlan, Kentucky” you will understand why traditions and attitudes, which we inherit from our forebears, can have a huge influence on success even after 100 years.
The typical myth of Asians being better at solving math problems was also revealed. It all comes down to how they express numbers. Let’s think of a simple but revealing example.
If in English we use eleven, twelve for 11 and 12, the Chinese use a much easier system: they transform them into ten-one, ten-two.
For twenty, thirty they use two-tens, three-tens. When it comes to adding, they don’t need to make the conversion in their head from the word to a number.
They have directly the number, and therefore arithmetical computations are easier.
With this advantage, an Asian child of 4 years old can count to 40 already, while an American child can count only to 15.
Only at age 5, he will be able to count until 40, being one year behind the Asian with the basic math skills. As it was described before, with this small advantage, he will gain more.

Heather Morris Biography
 is a New Zealand-born Melbourne-based Australian author
After getting a job at the Social Work Department at Monash Medical Centre in Melbourne in 1995, Morris decided to follow her passion for storytelling and creative writing and enrolled in The Professional Scriptwriting Course through the Australian College of Journalism.
Heather’s first screenplay was optioned by Academy Award-winning writer Pamella Wallace (Peter Weir’s 
). 
was also initially written as a script, but it eventually evolved into a self-published bestselling novel, Morris’ debut.

Plot
, writes Heather Morris in an Author’s note appended to this novel, “is a story of two ordinary people, living in an extraordinary time, deprived not only of their freedom but their dignity, their names, and their identities, and it is Lale’s account of what they needed to do to survive.”
 is the nickname of 
 (né 
), an Austro-Hungarian-born Slovak-Australian Holocaust survivor who served as Auschwitz’s main 
– i.e., tattooist – for the years between 1942 and 1945.
And when we say tattooist, we don’t mean someone who ornamented the bodies of people with tribals or a favorite quote or two.
Oh no!
This is a concentration camp in Nazi Germany, so you already know that Lale was the man responsible for all those numbers inked into the arms and hands of Holocaust survivors.
His story is even more remarkable, it turns out.
You see, Lale fell in love with one of the girls he had tattooed, 
.
She’s the second person of Morris’ concise summary of her novel.
But for many months of Lale’s life, she was nothing more than a number:
34902.
Lale and 34902
 opens in the Auschwitz concentration camp in June 1942, where we can witness a young man named Lale tattooing a young girl, a newcomer, with the number 34902.
Lale tries not to look at her all the while, and she, warned to say nothing, tries not to utter a single shriek, regardless of all the blood and pain.
“Well done,” he says to her once he completes his job.
And then, this happens:
The story shifts back a few months, and we learn that, in the month of April 1942, Lale was in the girl’s position himself: soon after his arrival to Auschwitz, he was tattooed with the number of 32407. 
“How can someone do this to another human being?” – Lale wonders. 
But it is only the beginning of his suffering.
Soon enough, he becomes ill from typhus, and it is only to the kindness of his bunkmates that he owes his survival.
After his recovery, Lale becomes an apprentice to 
, the tattooist of the camp. In the following two months, the two inscribe countless arms with unique ID numbers.
In June 1942, an all-female group arrives to the camp; one of the prisoners catches the eye of Lale; he tattooes her with the number 34902.
“Hurry up, Lale,” Pepan urges him.
When Lale looks up again, the girl is gone.
Head Tätowierer
Time passes, and one day Pepan mysteriously disappears.
But this is a place where you are not advised to use words such as 
 and 
 in situations such as these; the only thing you do is accept the fact and everything that comes with it.
In Lale’s case, the direct consequence is that he becomes the head Tätowierer of Auschwitz, a position which, naturally, comes with a few privileges; among them, the most important are knowing the date (we’re not joking!), extra rations and better lodgings.
It also comes with a bit of a setback: a personal guard.
His name is 
 
, a crude and violent man born in Romania, but also one whose not-so-very-pleasant past (to use a euphemism) can explain a lot about his behavior; though uneducated and brutal, Baretski is also humane enough to notice the way Lale looks at one brown-eyed girl one Sunday afternoon.
“Would you like to meet her?” – he asks the head tattooist. “Write to her, tell her you like her,” Baretski says to Lale’s surprise. “I’ll get you paper and a pencil and bring her your letter. What do you say? Do you know her name?”
Well, if you can say a number is a name, then you do too: it’s 34902.
Fortunately, Baretski is serious and, with his help, Lale finally meets the girl. 
He learns that her name is Gita, but nothing more: she’s simply not interested in sharing details about her past, for the simple reason that she doesn’t believe in her future.
However, the thing growing inside their hearts is just too powerful to be resisted.
And 
 almost anything.
A Network of Smugglers
Lale uses his privileged position to make Gita’s life a little more bearable in the camp: through Baretski, he sends her not only messages but also extra food for her and her close ones.
In addition, Lale creates a network of smugglers whose goal is quite about the same, but whose subject is broader.
This is how it works?
First, the girls who sort through the confiscated goods of the newly arrived prisoners bring him jewels and money and everything even remotely worthy.
Then, Lale uses the jewels to pay laborers from the nearby villages.
Next, these villagers sneak in food and medicine inside Auschwitz, which Lale either distributes to the ones in need or uses them to bribe other people in privileged positions such as him.
It’s little, but, in the end, it’s the most one can do at a place which was basically 
.
We, for once, can’t imagine a hell more frightening than the one walled within the concentration camps of Second World War Poland.
The Gypsies and Doctor Mengele
After some time, a large group of Romani people arrive at the camp and are lodged in Lale’s block.
A good place as any for a digression: people seem to forget that up to 1 million Romani were killed during the Holocaust!
Even more: what was Holocaust to one group of people, was actually Porajmos for another; in case you didn’t know, that’s the Romani word for “Devouring,” and the way the Romani refer to what we only know (unjustly) as the Holocaust.
Anyway, Lale is fascinated by the Romani way of life – who isn’t? – and he starts spending more and more time with them; after a while, he becomes an honorary Romani, and the block itself is lightened up by the new guests so much so that it becomes known as the “Gypsy camp.”
But, wait a second!
We’re in Auschwitz.
Of course, happiness and warmness are not things you usually feel here.
Enter Doctor Josef Mengele.
If you don’t know him – but you probably do from your nightmares – he was a member of a team of doctors who selected victims to be killed in the gas chambers.
In his case, however, the rest were the 
 fortunate, because they eventually became part of his pretty deadly medical experiments.
Yup, he was a real-life doctor Frankenstein; even worse: he used living and breathing people to conduct his experiments.
Temporarily Losing the Privileges
One day, the SS guards reveal jewels and food under Lale’s mattress.
Once again, this is Nazi Germany, so we don’t need to tell you what follows: Lale is stripped of his privileges, tossed into an interrogation cell, and beaten senseless.
Fortunately, he is not executed – thanks to his connections and the bribes mentioned above. However, after he is released from prison, Lale is made laborer for a while before his old job is given back to him once again.
Two years have passed since his imprisonment:
Lale can’t wait to go back to the Gypsy camp.
The only problem?
There’s no such thing anymore, because, in the meantime, most of its members – in a way, Lale’s extended family – had been murdered.
Thinking about Mengele, we have to add: others might not have been as fortunate.
The Separation
Half a year later, rumors of an uprising start circulating around Auschwitz, coupled with the news of the imminent arrival of the Soviet army.
The SS officers are dedicated to destroying the records and start transferring the prisoners.
Among the those transferred is Gita who Lale sees being marched out of the gates of the camp with hundreds of other female prisoners.
“Gita!” he screams, kneeling in the snow in front of an unmoving guard.
“He looks up at the sky, which seems only to be getting darker as the morning breaks. Above the noise of screaming guards and barking dogs, he hears her: ‘Furman. My name is Gita Furman!’”
There’s still time for Lale to shout out loud three more words: “I love you.”
Bratislava
Unbeknownst to Lale, Gita manages to escape from the guards and together with some other women, she finds refuge in a nearby village.
After some time, she reaches Bratislava, where she joins many other Holocaust survivors: in 1945, Bratislava was the main point for Holocaust survivors in Czechoslovakia. 
Two days before the liberation of Auschwitz, Lale is transferred himself to another place, the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. 
He manages to escape, but only to be captured by the Russians, who use Lale’s knowledge of quite a few languages to force him to find them lovely young ladies interested in spending some time with them.
After several weeks, Lale gains their trust and uses this to escape from the Russians as well.
Finally, he makes his way to Bratislava, but even after weeks of searching, he isn’t able to find anyone by the name of Gita Fuhrmann.
And then, one day, Gita and two of her friends pass by a funny-looking cart drawn by a tired old horse.
A young man climbs down from it.
“Is it him?” says one of Gita’s friends.
“Yes,” says Gita. “It is him.”
Lale is unable to move; Gita walks to Lale and kneels in front of him: “In case you didn’t hear me when we left Birkenau, I love you,” she says.
“Will you marry me,” he replies.
Do we really need to tell you the answer?
The Tattooist of Auschwitz Epilogue
And that’s how the novel ends.
But there’s an epilogue
to
written in the author’s more objective tone. Together with the “Additional information” section, this part gives a brief overview of what happened next to the real Lale and Gita. 
We learn that Lale and Gita chose the surname Sokolov because unlike Lale’s birth surname Eisenberg, this one sounded far more Slavic.
Lale founded a business dealing with the import of fine fabrics, the last in Bratislava to be nationalized by the communist government.
Subsequently, he was sent to prison, where (advised by a Catholic priest) he started acting mad so that he could see a psychiatrist with whose help he got leave from prison.
During these days, Lale and Gita managed to escape to Vienna, from where the couple emigrated to Australia and settled in Melbourne.
The two had a child named Gary, the author of the poignant “Afterword” to Morris’ book.

Do you know what the manosphere is?
Get an insight into it through one of its leading voices, Rollo Tomassi, and his extremely popular debut book:
Who Should Read “The Rational Male”? And Why?
“If you are picking this book up for the first time,” writes Rollo Tomassi at the beginning of 
,
or had it handed to you by a friend or loved one, and have never heard of the Rational Male or the manosphere or have had any exposure to the ideas I put forth here, I’ll humbly ask that you read with an open mind.”
And that’s an understatement!
As Tomassi notes just below, chances are you’ll find some (if not most) of the concepts in this book both radical and violently distasteful. 
Trust us: Tomassi is not blowing his own trumpet when he describes them as “concepts that will challenge your perspective on women, men, how they interact with each other, and how social structures evolve around those relations.”
To cut a long story short, you’ll probably think Tomassi is a misogynist after just a few pages of the book.
So, it goes without saying: this is 
 not a book any woman will ever want to lay its eyes upon.
As for the rest of the population, let’s put it this way: 
is for the ones who know who Roosh V and Roissy in DC are, or for the ones who like Neil Strauss’ 
and
Robert Green’s 
but hate 
and radical feminism
Even better: do you remember Tom Cruise’s character in 
? Well, Rollo Tomassi is kind of a real-world version of him.
About Rollo Tomassi
 is the pseudonym of the anonymous author of the blog 
.
Judging 
 published a year ago there, his primary occupation is (or, at least was until very recently) in the liquor and gaming promo business, and he began his online career writing on the SoSuave forums in his early 40s, about a decade ago.
He says his real name is “so white-bread generic it almost serves as a form of anonymity;” however, even after showing his face just recently to keep a few seminars and try himself at motivational speaking, he has gone on using his pseudonym, Rollo Tomassi.
All of his books – 
, 
 
, and
 
 – are compilations of articles published on his blog.
“The Rational Male PDF Summary”
In the fictional world, Rollo Tomassi is a name attached to an anonymous assailant in the brilliant neo-noir movie 
In the real world – with or without the “double l” or the “double s” – it is the name of at least two bands and (we guess) the pseudonym of one of the most respected online voices on male and masculinity-related issues.
Yup, that’s where his name comes from.
Known for a decade as the no-nonsense blogger behind therationalmale.com and now known even more as the author of three bestselling books of the same title (this one, and two others with differentiating subtitles: 
and 
), Rollo Tomassi is often described as “one of the leading voices in the globally growing, male-focused online consortium known as the ‘Manosphere.’” 
If you don’t know what manosphere is, then think of it as feminism only for men, aka meninism; in fact, feminism is one of the things the manosphere hates the most, maintaining that it is responsible for the crisis of masculinity we’re currently in.
But, make no mistake: when it comes to gender and sex, 
’s views are (
) “egalitarian to a fault” when compared to Tomassi’s.
Predictably, not few men think of 
as “the definitive work of gender dynamics for this generation” or “the single greatest counter-culture romance and dating guide of the decade.”
Tomassi’s book is filled with so many concepts and pieces of advice that it’s very difficult to summarize it; basically, each chapter – 
 section – introduces an acronym, an idea, or a model related to the gender dynamics.
Below, we’ve selected some of the most interesting ones; as for the rest – you can read them for free 
!
(If you’re a woman
 don’t!)
ONEitis
What is ONEitis, you ask?
Let us quote Tomassi:
In short, if you believe there is something like the One, then you’re sick; ONEitis is the name of your disease.
According to Tomassi, ONEitis is a paralysis, something which hinders your movement, your maturity, and your growth.
It is the foundational aspect of “the framework of the feminine:” you are made to believe that you are less than the man you really are.
The truth is “there are some good Ones, and there are some bad Ones, but there is no ONE. Anyone telling you anything else is selling you something.”
The Dynamics of Power
“In any relationship,” writes Tomassi, “the person with the most power is the one who needs the other the least.”
Power, according to him, is 
 foundation of any relationship, whether intersexual ones, familial or business relationships.
This dynamic is always in effect, whether you want it or not. 
In other words, everyone comes in any relationship looking to get something out of it, be it sex, money, love, lifestyle, or children.
Tomassi’s point?
The less you need from your partner, the more she needs you. 
Now, you understand how big of a problem the guy suffering from ONEitis has: he has absolutely no power over his relationship and, hence, no freedom whatsoever.
The Plate Theory
Tomassi’s plate theory imagines men as spinners of plates and women as, well, plates. (OK, it’s not the greatest of analogies).
The main idea behind it is that men should master their trade – aka, the gender dynamics – by spinning as many plates as possible.
Some of the plates will fall off immediately, others will spin for a time and then break, and a third group will keep on spinning throughout.
So, the point is not that you shouldn’t commit to a relationship; the point is that you need to do this only after you’ve spanned a few plates.
“The essence of plate theory is that a man is as confident and valuable as his options,” writes Tomassi. “This is the essence of the abundance mindset – confidence is derived from options.”
The Plugged-In AFCs
However, most men nowadays think of monogamy as the only way to live their lives; moreover, they suppress their masculinity, believing that women want harmless men.
This is not the truth: women want confident and assertive men, and you’ll not become one if you don’t spin your plates and take a red pill or two.
Instead, you’ll live your whole life as an AFC, an average frustrated chump plugged into the system.
You are already one if you can be described along these lines:
• First and foremost, you suffer from ONEitis;
• You subscribe to female idealizations;
• You believe that supplication is supportive, aka you believe that you must 
 so that your partner can 
 in your egalitarian relationship;
• Some parts of you believe in the Savior and/or the Martyr schema; the former means that you believe you’ll get some sex in return for solving some problems for a woman, and the latter that the more you sacrifice, the more devotion you show;
• Related: you believe in the friend’s debt, or the LJBF (let’s just be friends) relationship as a means to prospective intimacy.
We can go on, but we guess you got the point: unless you are an Alpha, you are an AFC.
The Red Pill Theory
So, it’s time to wake up!
It’s time that you spill the blue pill you’ve been force-fed ever since your birth and accept the red pill of truth.
It’s not really a comfortable one in the world you live in; in fact, some may say that it’s a bit misogynist, while others that it is a fireproof trip back to the Age of the Neanderthals.
Because the red pill truth of gender dynamics – says Rollo Tomassi – is that men are 
 to be the dominant sex; and that women 
this.
Those who say otherwise have been brainwashed by feminists:
In other words, women don’t want a man who’ll “do everything they say.” They want to be told “No” and they want to be around someone who’s secure and confident.
Nothing turns women on as men who are capable of putting their sexual impulse on hold to stick to their own beliefs and ambitions.
“This,” says Tomassi, “covertly communicates to a woman that his goals and determination trump her one real power over him – her sexuality. That is the man who is the prize, the ‘great catch,’ the male to be competed for with other women.”
The Five Stages of Unplugging
If you are an AFC, know beforehand that you need some effort to unplug from the Matrix and accept from the Matrix.
The five stages of unplugging – analogously to the five stages of grief – look like this:
 – 
: This is the AFC who’s read books such as this one and still thinks something along these lines: “These game guys are a bunch of clowns, there’s no way this works on women. Women aren’t stupid. What a bunch of misogynists.”
: “This is ridiculous!” – you think at this stage. “I just want to be myself, and these game guys want me to become a beast. Why wasn’t I born a Natural Alpha? I blame my parents/siblings/teachers/God/liberals/feminists/media/society…”
: “Well maybe it does have some good points… but, forget the hot girls, they’re way outta my league. I’ll give it a try if it can help me get around the bases with a Plain Jane. Do I have to wear the fuzzy hat and black nail polish?”
: “Wow, women really respond to this puffed-up act? And I just joined up for this? The world is sad, and so am I…”
: “Maybe this is the way things really work. I guess I should give up the gender relations mythology I’ve been holding onto… hey, what do you think of these negs I came up with?”
According to Tomassi, there’s also a sixth stage – 
– when men start preferring video games and porn to game rules. 
It’s a hardly relevant stage, but Tomassi added it for precautionary measures since it’s a common aftereffect of unplugging.
Rollo Tomassi’s Iron Rules
In one of the chapters, Tomassi also shares his personal nine Iron Rules of dating.
Here they are:
. “Always be aware of the subconscious balance of who’s frame in which you are operating. Always control the Frame, but resist giving the impression that you are.”
. “Never, under pain of death, honestly or dishonestly reveal the number of women you’ve slept with or explain any detail of your sexual experiences with them to a current lover.”
. “Ignore any woman who makes you wait for sex, or by her actions implies she is making you wait for sex; the sex is NEVER worth the wait.”
 “Never under any circumstance live with a woman you aren’t married to or are not planning to marry in within 6 months.”
 “It’s called birth control because someone is ‘controlling’ the birth.” (Aka: use condoms.)
 “Women are fundamentally incapable of loving a man in the way that a man expects to be loved by a woman. Men believe that love matters for the sake of it. Women love opportunistically.”
. “It is always time and effort better spent developing relations with new, fresh, prospective women than it will ever be in attempting to reconstruct a failed relationship.”
 
 Always let a woman figure out why she won’t have sex with you, never do it for her.
. “Never seriously self-deprecate with a woman you intend to be intimate with. Apologizing for a lack of Game isn’t Game.”
Key Lessons from “The Rational Male”
1.      Men and Women Are Different
2.      The Red Pill of Gender Dynamics
3.      Beat the ONEitis and Become an Alpha
Men and Women Are Different
The underlying premise of 
– and the manosphere, for that matter – is fairly simple: men and women are different, and it’s wrong to strive to build a world in which they have the same rights and desires.
Simply put, they are biologically wired to have different needs, and no matter what we do, this will remain the same.
To quote Jordan Peterson: “the insistence that the highest moral virtue for the modern man is harmlessness… is absurd. Women don’t even like harmless men. They hate them. They like to claw them apart. What women want are dangerous men who are civilized. And they want to help civilize them. That’s 
.”
The Red Pill of Gender Dynamics
“The operative framework, the reality we function in,” writes Rollo Tomassi near the end of 
, “is primarily defined by the feminine.”
He says that he first became aware of this after watching a popular sit-com with a critical eye. “There simply were no positively masculine actors or roles on any show, and rather, every male was ridiculed for his masculinity.”
And that was his red pill, the one which awakened him to the fact that feminization and feminine-primacy are everywhere and that we are all plugged into an operative framework which portrays neither the world nor the human beings as they actually are.
In other words, each and every one of us has been given (repeatedly!) the blue pill of egalitarianism, even though, in reality, women themselves don’t want to be equal to men; what they want is what almost every female being in the animal world wants: subjection, dominance, and traditional gender roles.
We’ve been brainwashed, says Tomassi, and this has led to a blue-pill world in which everything is nice and shiny – but untrue and prison-like.
Beat the ONEitis and Become an Alpha
If you are a man who believes in the one and true love for all times and a day, then you are actually an AFC, aka Average Frustrated Chump who’s suffering from ONEitis.
In other words, you’re plugged into the operative framework of the world which has put you in the prison of feminine and made you unhappy.
To unplug yourself, you must become aware of the dynamics of the sexual marketplace. In other words, you must drink the red pill offered to you by the manosphere and realize that you’ll be much more wanted when you need the other gender less.
And this will make you an alpha, the man women want, the Beauty’s Beast.

“The Rational Male Quotes”
Our Critical Review
OK, we have to be honest: although we know that many men will find many appealing and even inspiring ideas in this book, we didn’t like 
one bit.
For one, we believe that (just like Jordan Peterson) it has gotten the 
 story wrong. 
Namely, it’s only a truism that underneath our docile, civilized nature we’re savage, animalistic creatures with vile desires and needs.
It’s also a truism that these desires differ between men and women: we’ve evolved treading different paths, and the one trodden by men basically commanded them to become beasts; in addition, the one treaded by women required them to look for beasts.
Being beaten once or twice a month was the price women had to pay to survive for millennia; being “married” to a harmless man a hundred thousand years ago would have probably resulted in their – and their children’s – deaths; harmless men are incapable of defending their families when attacked by a lion.
However, it’s the 21
 century, and we’re living in a different day and age; there are no lions anymore. And we’re free to look back at how we got here and 
 our evolutionary paths.
If an abuse victim is suffering from Stockholm syndrome, you don’t go on and tell her that she’ll just have to live with the condition forevermore; you try to help her. 
And it’s not fair that so many meninists are doing the former."

You are a creature of habits.
In 
, James Clear offers an easy and proven way for you to build good habits and break bad ones.
We can sum it up in brief with him as: “tiny changes – remarkable results.”

more than belongs in this company – it’s probably one of the best books on habits you’ll ever read.
About James Clear
 is an American author, speaker, and photographer.
He is one of the foremost authorities on habits and decision-making, having taught more than 10,000 leaders of today through the Habits Academy, “the premier training platform for individuals and organizations that are interested in building better habits in life and work.”
A critically acclaimed
bestseller, 
is his debut book.

“Atomic Habits PDF Summary”
Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference
“It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis,” writes James Clear in 
Why?
Well, because of Hollywood and media and everything that’s so frighteningly bad with this world. 
When you see a movie about an artist, you don’t really see him tirelessly working on his painting or poem for months and months, making small improvements to it day in day out.
Oh no!
What you see is him falling down in a trance at a certain moment (usually induced by some unimportant and trivial event) and having a revelatory vision which 
 makes his work worthwhile.
“Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action,” Clear goes on. “Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.”
But it doesn’t work that way!
Or, better yet, as Robert Maurer revealed in his guide to kaizen, it 
work that way, but only sometimes; continuous improvement beats radical innovation 9 times out of ten!
And it’s pure and simple logic: even though improving by 1% isn’t particularly notable or 
, in the long run, it is very, very meaningful.
Clear provides the math:
• 1% worse every day for one year: 0.99
 = 00.03
• 1% better every day for one year: 1.01
 = 37.78
Or to visualize that in a graph provided, once again, by Clear:
The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
Now, what James Clear is actually talking about when he is talking about small improvements is something much bigger, something which actually makes you who you are and defines your identity.
Yes, habits, the bane of your existence.
Clear neatly defines habits as “
.” To make the definition even clearer, Clear (ha, pun unintended!) uses a financial analogy.
Namely, your habits work similarly to money: the same way money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them.
You’ll notice no difference in terms of your physical condition if you spend 20 minutes of your morning working out; but do that for a few months, and suddenly you’ll spot the outline of that coveted six-pack.
Contrarywise, eating a single pizza will not make you fat or unhealthy; but eating pizza every day for a few months will definitely have negative effects.
The value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes apparent – and strikingly, too – only after a year, a few years, or even a decade.
So, improving 1 percent every day is not merely a good strategy: it’s the best one you’ll ever hear from anyone.
Especially if you think of your habits as being part of a system; hence the title of Clear’s book. It’s not “atomic” as in A-bomb powerful, earth-shattering events that will change everything in an instant, but “atomic” as in tiny, miniscule clogs of a result-oriented machine:
How Progress Works, aka Beware the Valley of Disappointment
That’s great, you say.
1% improvement overtime amounts to something more than 1%; but I really think, you add, that, in reality, it doesn’t exactly work this way.
I’ve tried this numerous times, and every time I end up disappointed: two months of working out for 20 minutes produces no results whatsoever in my case!
Well, of course it doesn’t: small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold.
Imagine, says Clear, that you have an ice cube sitting at the table in front of you. In the beginning, the room is about twenty-five degrees, but it gradually heats up.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight degrees – nothing happens to the ice cube; twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one – still the same.
Thirty-two degrees.
And suddenly, the ice begins to melt: “a one-degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change!”
In other words, small changes often appear to have no effect whatsoever until a critical threshold is passed; afterward, the magic happens; the effects may be delayed, but afterward they are pretty powerful; 
 requires patience.
Don’t believe us?
Take it from the San Antonio Spurs, one of the most successful NBA teams in history. This Jacob Riis quote hangs in their locker room for a reason:
Remember: incremental progress is never linear; and hard work is always stored until its effects are suddenly revealed.
Trust the process.
Endure.
How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
In 1898, a psychologist by the name of Edward Thorndike conducted an experiment that, once and for all, revealed to the world how habits work and which rules guide our behavior.
Ever interested in animal behavior, Thorndike decided to put some cats in a puzzle box, designed in such a way that one could escape from it by pressing a certain lever.
Of course, nobody wants to be locked in a box, so every cat that was put there did its best to find a way out; eventually, each of them did find the magical lever and successfully escaped the box.
Thorndike repeated the experiment many times over; with each trial, the cats got better at finding the lever.
For example, Cat 12 took the following times to perform the act: 160 seconds, 30 seconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20, 12, 10, 14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7.
In other words, during the first three trials, the cat escaped in an average of 1.5 minutes; during the last three trials, it took Cat 12 no more than 7 seconds to do the same.
Why?
Obviously, because it learned to repeat those behaviors which resulted in satisfying consequences and not to repeat those which produced unpleasant consequences.
Afterward, it let its brain work on autopilot.
And that’s how you form habits as well.
In other words, the feedback loop behind all human behavior is pretty simple: try, fail, learn, try differently. With practice, the useless movements peter out, and the useful actions get reinforced. 
Habits are – to quote Clear yet again – mental shortcuts learned from experience.
As you know full well from Charles Duhigg’s great, great book (Clear shares our opinion) 
, each habit is actually a four-step pattern:
You can find more about each of them by reading Duhigg’s book – or our summary of it – but, here are brief explanations which should make this summary self-contained as well:
• 
: the trigger which predicts a reward: 
;
• 
: the motivational force behind every habit; what makes you act; in the case above, 
;
• 
: the actual habit you perform: 
;
• 
: the end goal of every habit: the cue is all about noticing the reward, the craving about wanting it, and the response about obtaining it; once the reward comes your way, your craving is satisfied;
Your brain wants your cravings satisfied (it is “a reward detector”); so, it memorizes the steps which lead to this; in our case, phone buzzing becomes associated with phone grabbing, and this creates a neurological feedback loop, aka an automatic habit:
Habits are created only when everything works on all four stages; if the reward fails to satisfy your craving, the response asks a lot of energy from you, or you never ever happen upon the initial cue in the future, the habit loop will never start or complete.
Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur; without all four, a behavior will never evolve into a habit.
Now, the key to changing your life for the better is simple: create good habits and eliminate bad ones. 
Knowing the four-step habit pattern helps a lot – because it makes it very clear what you should do at each step if you want to break a bad habit or, even better, create a good one.
Clear calls his method – or, rather, framework – the 
 and he describes it thus:
In practice, this framework looks like this:
Or, inverted:
Now, the bulk of 
 is dedicated to explaining in detail these Four Laws of Behavior Change. We’ve summarized them as the Key Lessons one should take from James Clear’s book.
Key Lessons from “Atomic Habits”
1.      The 1
 Law (Cue): Make It Obvious
2.      The 2
 Law (Craving): Make It Attractive
3.      The 3
 Law (Response): Make It Easy
4.      The 4
 Law (Reward): Make It Satisfying
The 1st Law (Cue): Make It Obvious
Anne Thorndike is a Boston-based doctor who wanted to improve her patients’ dietary habits, starting with eliminating sodas from their menu and introducing more water.
And – believe it or not – she did it!
How, you wonder?
Well, instead of telling them what your doctor has told you numerous times (“Drinking soda is not healthy”), she merely rearranged the hospital cafeteria, so that the refrigerators next to the cash registers contain mainly water (as opposed to exclusively soda).
In three months’ time, water sales shot up by 25 percent, and soda sales dropped by 11.
In other words, if you want to learn to play an instrument, put the instrument in the middle of your room; want to eat healthier food – put the salads on the counters, and the snacks all the way back in the drawers.
Because sometimes all you need is just a little 
 in the right direction.
The 2nd Law (Craving): Make It Attractive
In 1954, James Olds and Peter Milner did some Frankenstein-like experiments with rats so that they uncover the real nature of desire.
Using electrodes, they blocked the release of dopamine, 
: it’s the hormone your body releases when you either do or think about pleasurable activities.
The second is more interesting: as (we guess) you know full well, sometimes thinking – or even dreaming – about sex can result in the same 
pleasure as actually having it.
The point?
Dopamine is what drives you to do things, what makes you look forward to them.
Use this to create habits the same way Ronan Byrne, an Irish engineering student did. Namely, to make himself exercise, he hacked an exercise bike so that it would only allow him to watch Netflix if he is cycling at a certain speed.
Another example?
Don’t want to do the dishes?
Play your favorite music while you do them; after a year or so, you’ll forget that you don’t want to do them.
Oh, what happened to the rats?
They died, of course. Bereaved of dopamine, they stopped eating, drinking, and reproducing, utterly losing the will to go on living.
The 3rd Law (Response): Make It Easy
The reason why you scroll so often through your phone is that that’s a lot easier than reading or studying a new language.
Your brain is not interested in tiring itself needlessly and would do anything to get its reward through minimum effort.
So, allow your brain that pleasure.
In other words, make the actions which lead to the reward as easy as possible if you want to create a good habit; quite the opposite, if you want to eliminate a bad one, increase the friction between the cue and the reward difficult one.
Watch a lot of TV? 
Then unplug it and take the batteries out of the remote. 
Want to read some more?
Then start by forcing yourself to read just two pages a day; you’ll likely continue reading because getting started is the most difficult step toward doing something.
The 4th Law (Reward): Make It Satisfying
This is the most difficult part of creating a good habit or breaking a bad one.
Why?
Because the whole of evolution works against you.
Namely, we evolved in an immediate-return environment, and now we live in a delayed-return one.
Our ancestors couldn’t care less about long-term plans, because they had much more immediate concerns, like finding a shelter for the night or hunting the next meal.
Oh, and also because nobody could guarantee them that they’ll live to see tomorrow, let alone the next decade.
However, nowadays, you know that you will; unfortunately, your body is still used to this ancient immediate-return framework of living.
The tweak?
Attach some immediate gratification to all of your delayed-return habits; otherwise, it’d be a bit difficult for you to persevere.

Our Critical Review
One of

is everything you’d expect from a book about habits written after Charles Duhigg’s 
.
 describes it as “supremely practical and useful,” 
 as “engaging, hands-on [guide] to break bad routines and make good ones,” and 
 deems it “a special book.”As often, we have nothing to add:

It’s just like 
 millennium and a half ago: “a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.”
You know why?
Because making the same small step every day will eventually get you to your goal – be it a thousand miles in the distance!
And that’s the essence of the Kaizen Way, summed up perfectly by Robert Maurer in the title of his book:
Who Should Read “One Small Step Can Change Your Life”? And Why?
Kaizen is a Japanese word meaning “change for the better” but usually (and more aptly) translated with the phrase “continuous improvement;” originally developed and practiced in Japanese businesses after World War II, its philosophy has been applied in many spheres ever since, ranging from psychotherapy to life-coaching, from government to healthcare. 
It’s so popular, in fact, that it’s certainly one of the few things – if not 
 only one – that Tony Robbins, Robin Sharma and (of all people) Nassim Nicholas Taleb have in common.
Believe it or not, each of them has dedicated a chapter of their most celebrated books – 
, 
and 
 –
to 
, the Japanese art of gradual and continuous development to perfection.
Understandably, the concept is a staple in many books related to how Japanese businesses are run, such as Hiroshi “Mickey” Mikitani’s 
 or Jeffrey K. Liker’s 
.
Written by a renowned psychologist, 
functions as an introductory self-help guide to kaizen, both explicating its foundations theoretically and stressing the significance of applying them to your life, one by one.
It is – as its blurb states – “for anyone who wants to lose weight; or quit smoking; or write a novel, start an exercise program, get out of debt, or conquer shyness and meet new people.”

“One Small Step Can Change Your Life PDF Summary”
purports to be – to quote its blurb yet again – “the essential guide to kaizen, the art of making great and lasting change through small, steady steps.”
As such, in its introductory first chapter – “Why Kaizen Works” – it first describes the power of kaizen to change your life and the mechanisms by which it does; then, in the following six chapters, it portrays each of the main six kaizen techniques you should use to apply the philosophy in any sphere of your life:
• asking small questions to dispel fear and inspire creativity;
• thinking small thoughts to develop new skills and habits-without moving a muscle;
• taking small actions that guarantee success;
• solving small problems, even when you’re faced with an overwhelming crisis;
• bestowing small rewards to yourself or others to produce the best results; and
• recognizing the small but crucial moments that everyone else ignores.
In the eighth chapter of the book – “Kaizen for Life” – Maurer brings his discussion to a close, suggesting his readers that kaizen “is more profound than a tool for simply crossing the finish line,” and that one should think of it much more in terms of “a process that is never done.” 
If so, he says, kaizen will invite you “to see life as an opportunity for continuous improvement, for ever-higher standards and expanding potential.”
Interested in such a leap?

Innovation vs. Kaizen
Whether in business or your personal life, there are two ways to break the old routines and introduce something new: either through innovation or through gradual improvement.
The former is radical and usually initiates something revolutionary: that’s what Whitney Johnson – translating Schumpeter and Christensen into the language of self-help books – talks about in 
Gradual improvement, on the other hand, means doing something better than the day before, no matter what, no matter how small.
The difference between the two?
Innovation is a short-term make-or-break strategy that can either bring you great success or result in complete and utter failure; gradual improvement, on the other hand, is a long-term approach and, patience granted, works 
.
In other words, if you want to stop smoking cigarettes, you can either do that by deciding to stop smoking them overnight (radical innovation) or eliminate one by one cigarette over a certain period of time until you have no interest in them whatsoever.
Sure, in the first case you can lose the bad habit earlier, but studies have shown that the latter approach is far more successful and has an enduring effect.
And that’s the very essence of kaizen, described by Maurer as the process of taking small steps for continual improvement.
Despite the foreign name, kaizen is actually an American product, first applied systematically in Depression-era America.
Developed by none other than management guru W. Edwards Deming, its principles were subsequently developed into management courses called Training Within Industries (TWI), which greatly accelerated America’s manufacturing capacity during the war. 
General Douglas MacArthur introduced them to Japan after the end of the Second World War, and thousands of Japanese business executives took them.
The rest – as they say – is history.
Why Kaizen Works
Just like our society and our businesses, your body is also not built to be able to absorb and implement radical changes overnight; “all changes,” writes Maurer, “even 
 ones, are scary.”
, your brain consists of at least three parts:
• 
, aka the reptilian brain, the part of your brain which “wakes you up in the morning, sends you off to sleep at night, and reminds your heart to beat;”
• 
, aka the mammalian brain, the one which “regulates the body’s internal temperature, houses our emotions, and governs the fight-or-flight response that keeps us alive in the face of danger;”
• 
, which is “responsible for the miracle of being human. Civilization, art, science, and music all reside there. It’s where our rational thoughts and creative impulses take place. When we want to make a change, or jump-start the creative process, we need access to the cortex.”
Now, the problem is that to access the cortex you need to first go through the brain stem and the midbrain and the latter one has something called the amygdala.
Now, the amygdala is responsible for your flight-or-fight response and is not that keen on changes; it also blocks access to the cortex when it thinks that something is too dangerous to deserve contemplation.
If there’s a lion, your amygdala says, you don’t really need your brain to think what you should do; you need to either fight or (more probably) run.
The problem is – 
; it reacts the same way in all three situations. 
But that’s exactly why kaizen works!
It basically tricks the amygdala, telling it: “oh, come on, you, this is nothing too big or dramatic…”

Key Lessons from “One Small Step Can Change Your Life”
1.      Ask Small Questions
2.      Think Small Thoughts
3.      Take Small Actions
4.      Solve Small Problems
5.      Bestow Small Rewards
6.      Identify Small Moments
Ask Small Questions
Robert Maurer introduces the first kaizen technique thus:
Your brain loves questions and riddles: it treats them as something harmless and accepts them with childlike wonder.
And that’s true even for toddlers who, though inattentive to didactic statements (“This is a doggie”) are wide-eyed when they hear a question, even if the answer is supplied by the one posing it (“What’s this? This is a doggie.”)
However, when you ask questions, you have to be careful and aware not to wake the amygdala; big questions induce fear and this, in turn, shuts down your cortex; in contrast, small questions communicate directly with it.
Here are a few ideas Maurer shares with his readers:
• For the unhappy: 
• For those with a specific goal: 
• For those who have a conflict with someone: 
It’s kaizen, so don’t forget: you need to ask yourself these questions 
 than once.
Think Small Thoughts
Thinking small thoughts is a strategy much akin to visualization; aptly named “mind sculpturing,” thinking small thoughts should help you form a certain response to a certain situation beforehand so that your brain can ignore the panicky amygdala when the time comes.
This is how the technique works, broken down into 10 small steps:
#1. Isolate a task which makes you uncomfortable and give yourself at least a month before actually doing it;
#2. Allot a few seconds (not minutes!) you’re willing to devote to mind sculpturing this task every day;
#3. Sit down in a quiet, comfortable spot and close your eyes;
#4. Imagine yourself in this difficult or uncomfortable situation; what do you see? Who’s there? What do the people look like?
#5. Now expand your imagination to the rest of your senses: sounds, smells, flavors, textures.
#6. Imagine that you’re actually doing the task – but don’t move a single muscle; remember the words, the voice, the physical gestures;
#7. Imagine a positive response to your actions;
#8. Do this every day, until the imagining becomes effortless; then increase the length of allotted time for mind sculpturing; if it doesn’t work – go back a few steps; never force kaizen;
#9. Once you’re comfortable, imagine the worst-case scenario and start imagining how you would react to it;
#10. When you feel ready, start with a few small steps before actually doing the big task.
Take Small Actions
The last step of thinking small thoughts brings us to the third kaizen strategy: taking small actions. 
This one’s self-explanatory, and can best be understood in terms of how it works in real life:
• If you think you’re spending too much, then remove 
 object from your shopping cart before heading to the cash register;
• If you want to tidy up your house, 
; just pick a small area, set your timer for 5 minutes, and do the work; stop when the timer goes off no matter how into the task you are;
• if you want to get more sleep, start by going to bed just one minute earlier at night.
“These little actions usually sound bizarre to the uninitiated,” writes Maurer. “But if you have struggled to make a big change-to drop twenty pounds, to change careers, or to steady a sinking romance-and failed, then you might appreciate how small changes can help.”
And, indeed, they can: big, bold efforts to make a change are usually counterproductive, resulting in aversion; small changes result in a new habit; this time – a good one.
Solve Small Problems
You know how you say to yourself “I’ll do the dishes tomorrow – after all, there are only three today!” And you know how, a few days later, there’s not one dish clean in your apartment, and every part of your body rages against you getting up of your bed and just going near to your sink?
Well, that’s because you’re unconsciously allowing kaizen to devolve to a situation when radical innovation is the only way out.
Why should you do it?
Solving small problems usually means the absence of big ones; and small problems are always around you; you just need to identify them and act:
Bestow Small Rewards
In the end – let’s face it – you’re just an animal; and as such, you can often be easily trained to act properly in much the same manner Pavlov trained his dogs to salivate whenever they heard a bell.
The best thing?
You don’t need Pavlov to do it.
You can do it yourself by bestowing yourself small rewards which can motivate you to continue your path to improvement in the right direction.
What does this mean in practice?
Simple: find a 
 reward and treat yourself with it! 
However, always have in mind these three rules:
#1. The reward should be appropriate 
: it’s certainly not smart to treat yourself with chocolate if you’re on a weight loss program;
#2. The reward should be appropriate 
: you know yourself best, so don’t let other people tell you what the appropriate reward for you is;
#3. The reward should be either free or inexpensive; anything from a few more minutes to relax or to spend on your hobby to watching television, playing your favorite piece of music, or soaking in the tub.
The point?
Trick your brain into thinking that you’ll 
get the reward if you don’t do the job which grants it.
Identify Small Moments
“The kaizen approach to life,” writes Maurer, “requires a slower pace and an appreciation of small moments. This pleasant technique can lead to creative breakthroughs and strengthened relationships, and give you a daily boost toward excellence.”
Unfortunately, everything’s going too fast nowadays, so we’ve forgotten to appreciate these small moments.
Maurer offers a series of steps “to help your mind stay open, playful, and alert to small moments, even in emotionally charged situations”:
#1. Look for a person – preferably a stranger – who has an opposite opinion from you on a hot-button topic;
#2. Start a conversation with him, but not with the goal to sway him from his beliefs: just ask him questions about his position;
#3. Try not to argue, persuade, or sound judgmental;
#4. Notice if the person is becoming more relaxed and chattier; if so, you’re succeeding.
Remember: it is through these small moments (and your reactions in them) that Dr. John Gottman was able to predict (in staggering 93% of the cases) if 
.
Believe us: ignoring small moments (pleasant phone calls, arriving home at the promised time, inquiring about dental appointments) is not worth the risk.

“One Small Step Can Change Your Life Quotes”
Our Critical Review
Susan Jeffers, author of 
, says that 
is “a wonderful, very readable book that describes a peaceful and simple way of handling all the difficulties in our lives. You will breathe a sigh of relief as you read it!”
Now, it’s not that Robert Maurer’s book says something revelatory or unearths something surprising and shocking; it’s just timeproof mystical wisdom served in a more digestible package if not more merely because organized and rationalized.
And considering the time we live in, we suppose that that’s something worthy of appreciation.So, do yourself a favor and read 
in one sitting (it’s neither long nor complicated book); however, start applying its principles immediately afterward and do that as long as you live.

“Manage Your Day-to-Day PDF Summary”
In the “Preface” to 
, Jocelyn K. Glei, 99U’s editor-in-chief, introduces this unique book by saying that it “assembles insights around four key skill sets you must master to succeed.”
The skill sets serve as the titles of each of the four chapters, all of which, in turn, consist of five different articles (one of which is always a Q&A) written by some of the most creative thought leaders of today.
The goal?
To see the same problem from at least a few different perspectives, because it’s her belief that it’s just improbable that, in the 21
 century, there exists such thing as a “one size fit all” solution to everyone’s productivity/creativity problems:
In the “Foreword” to the book, Scott Belsky, the founder of 
and the author of 
and 
, notes that, as far as he is concerned, Glei’s hope is vindicated by the content of the book.
And we kind of share his opinion.
Allow us to tell you in brief why.
Chapter One – Building A Rock-Solid Routine
According to Woody Allen, 80 percent of success is showing up. Because that’s where routines start. “Building a routine,” writes Glei, “is all about persistence and consistency. Don’t wait for inspiration; create a framework for it.”
Mark McGuinness says that if you’re not careful, there’s a high chance that you’ll end up spending the best part of your day on other people’s priorities.
“The single most important change you can make in your working habits,” he notes afterward, “is to switch to creative work first, reactive work second. This means blocking off a large chunk of time every day for creative work on your own priorities, with the phone and e-mail off.”
This is how you can do this:
• Notice when you seem to have the most energy during the day, and dedicate those valuable periods to your most important creative work;
• 
;
• Manage/limit your daily to-do list;
• Train yourself to record every commitment you make somewhere that will make it impossible to forget;
• Set a start time and a finish time for your workday—even if you work alone; dedicate different times of day to different activities.
Gretchen Rubin, the author of not 
, but 
 with happy titles and baroque subtitles, says that as a writer, she works every single day, including weekends, holidays, and vacations.
Why?
Because the key to making things easier for you is making them more frequent.
According to Gretchen, frequency has a lot of benefits.
These are the main ones:
• it makes starting easier;
• it keeps ideas fresh;
• it keeps the pressure off;
• it sparks creativity;
• it nurtures frequency;
• it fosters productivity.
All in all, frequency is a 
approach, because, in life, there will always be numerous pressing obligations from your job and your family; this is the only way to face them without sacrificing your creativity and productivity.
In “Honing Your Creative Practice,” 
 answers some of the burning routine-related questions, such as “What’s the hardest part about getting a daily routine right?” and “How do you keep your short-term work aligned with your long-term objectives?”
It’s Seth Godin, so – you’ve got to read the answers!
Tony Schwartz, president and CEO of the Energy Project and the author of 
and 
, reminds us – through the story of a fictional creative director of a large agency named Zeke – that our capacity is limited.
Consequently, no routine would work if it doesn’t include renewal, i.e., moments to recharge your batteries; yes, we’re talking about getting regular sleep, breaks, and walks.
You won’t make it without them.
There’s a reason why Leo Babauta begins his article with a quote by Henry David Thoreau: he believes that in the loud world of today, “even a small time set aside for solitude each day – from twenty minutes to an hour – can make an enormous difference.”
But, hey, you should have expected such an advice of Babauta: he is the author of 
, one of the seminal books on minimalism.
Chapter Two – Finding Focus in a Distracted World
“In a world filled with distraction,” writes Glei, “attention is our competitive advantage. Look at each day as a challenge – and an opportunity – to keep your eye on the prize.”
Cal Newport – the author of 
, 
, and 
 – is a professor at Georgetown University, torn between his creative assignments and his constantly overflowing Inbox.
His solution?
Daily focus blocks and resisting distraction.
In practice, this means no e-mail, no Internet, and no phone for a specific amount of time at a specific location – no matter what!
Congratulations: now you have a creative corner.
Christian Jarrett is a psychologist, so he should know best how your mind works.
And as far as he is concerned, the first thing you need to understand if you want to find focus in the distracted world of today is that there’s no such thing as multitasking.
In other words, it’s either 
 or no task.
Science guarantees.
Dan Ariely is fascinated with the irrational so much that he’s written some of the best-known and best-loved books related to it: 
, 
, and 
.
Naturally, in this Q&A, he answers question related to the hidden motivations and temptations that lurk behind our decisions – and offers some tricks and tweaks on how to master them.
In addition to being an advocate for simple living, Erin Rooney Doland is editor-in-chief at unclutterer.com and author of the book 
.
Her advice?
Life is never going to be a walk in the park, so, if you want to produce something worthwhile, you’ll need to find a way to produce it amidst chaos.
That means mindful (and not mindless) work and, more importantly, a lot of self-control.
Scott Belsky makes another appearance, this time as an author of an article which promotes living in the now as the only way to achieve something.
Being present should be your priority, he says, and this means that you should:
• Be aware of the cost of constant connection;
• Recognize when you’re tuning in to the stream for the wrong reasons;
• Create windows of non-stimulation in your day;
• Listen to your gut as much as you listen to others; and
• Stay open to the possibilities of serendipity.
Chapter Three – Taming Your Tools
“Technology should be a tool,” reminds us Jocelyne Glei, “but if we do not keep our wits about us, it can easily become our taskmaster.”
Here are ways you can keep things under control.
Ah, that dreaded e-mail Inbox! 
According to a recent study, the average knowledge worker spends about third of his week (28%) either writing, reading, or responding to e-mail.
If you want to turn this around, Aaron Dignan says, then you better:
• Become aware of your complex goals and tape a list of them to your desk so that it serves to you as a constant reminder;
• Make your complex goals a priority and rummage through your Inbox with this in mind;
• Let things go: let’s face it, there will never be enough time for you to read all of those starred articles; it’s time that you go all Frozen on them!
Here are three more bits of advice related to your Internet presence coming from Lori Deschene, the founder of tinybuddha.com:
• Log on with intention – when browsing Facebook becomes the first thing you do when bored, then it is bad;
• Become aware – without self-awareness of why you use Facebook or Twitter, you are merely their slave;
• Find a purpose, esteem, and form a meaningful connection.
Tiffany Shlain, the woman behind the acclaimed documentary 
, waltzes through the “Taming Your Tools” Q&A quite strongly, suggesting not only a “technology shabbat” from time to time, but also heeding to a powerful Socrates’ quote: “Nothing vast enters the life of mortals without a curse.”
Always remember: the Internet brings a lot of good stuff – but it costs you many other things as well.
Linda Stone is the woman who has coined the terms “continuous partial attention,” “e-mail apnea,” “screen apnea,” and “conscious computing.”
And, in a way, all of them boil down to this: we haven’t evolved to use the technology in a way which will not cause us anxiety; we’re still too young and inexperienced.
Stone calls the new set of skills we must acquire to “embody” when we use technology “conscious computing.”
And she says that diaphragmatic breathing, Buteyko breathing, martial arts, and yoga (pranayama) breathing are a great start in the right direction.
In “Reclaiming Our Self-Respect,” James Victore notes that the crux of the problem of the modern world is that we’ve lost the distinction between urgent and important. 
“When we choose urgent over important,” he says, “what we are really choosing is other people’s priorities over our own.”
And he goes on: “With every new e-mail, we become like leaves in the wind, reacting to any breeze willy-nilly. We quickly set aside our own concerns to attend to those of others. This busywork pulls our attention from the meaningful work—taking time to think, reflect, and imagine.”
The last three are the things which really make you human; and the things you need to take back by force from the technology of today and, thus, reclaim your self-respect.
Chapter Four – Sharpening Your Creative Mind
The five articles in the fourth and last chapter of 
 offer a few pieces of advice on “how to push to creative blocks and keep the aha moments coming.”
Todd Henry’s article is a paean to Unnecessary Creation, aka creating for the most important audience of all: yourself.
According to Henry, these are the three (necessary) benefits of Unnecessary Creation:
• Unnecessary Creation gives you the freedom to explore new possibilities and follow impractical curiosities.
• Unnecessary Creation allows you to take risks and develop new skills that can later be applied to your on-demand creating.
• Unnecessary Creation provides a forum for the pursuit of voice, and a reminder that you are not the sum of what you make.
Scott McDowell tries to tackle one of the most difficult questions all creative artists are faced with, sooner or later: “what do you do when you have to be creative and it’s just not coming?”
His suggestions?
• Disengage, wander, and rest;
• Work within certain limits and constraints: this puts your brain into problem-solving mode: “too big a playing field can muddle the results… a set of limitations is often the catalyst that sets creativity free.
• Exercise, sleep, meditate, be calm.
Stefan Sagmeister is a designer and typographer, known for his unorthodox approach to creativity; his answers demonstrate that what the other articles in this section suggest is right on the spot!
Elizabeth Grace Saunders believes that there are two kinds of creative minds on this planet: perfectionists and pragmatists.
Contrary to what many might say, Saunders doesn’t think that one of these categories is better than the other; she merely advises to choose wisely whose method you’ll use at different stages of the creative process.
Because sometimes being perfectionist can get you stuck; other times, however, being a pragmatist can cost you some quality.
Mann, Fowles, Kahlo, Twain, Pop… none of them was immune to creative blocks; Mark McGuinnes says that this is only natural, since creative blocks are “an occupational hazard for creative professionals.”
So, the next time you experience a creative block, be aware that you’re in a good company; next, identify which type of a block it is and take a leaf out of these artists’ books:
• 
: if your inspiration tank is empty, then take a break – just like Twain did while writing 
;
• 
: John Fowles was embarrassed about the sexual content of his books when he imagined his parents reading them; if you’re feeling this way, give yourself permission to create by saying that you will not make it public; when you’re finished, you’ll decide if you’re going to;
• 
: Extrinsic motivations (money and reputation) have a negative impact on creativity; focus on the intrinsic ones (fascination, pleasure);
• 
: you don’t have any more personal problems than Frida Kahlo;do what she did: turn them into art;
• 
: make a virtue of necessity and achieve as much as you can with what you have;
• 
: if you want to succeed, you need to communicate and grow a thicker skin; it’s that simple.
Coda – A Call to Action
ends with a Call to Action by novelist Steven Pressfield, the author of quite a few non-fiction books we’d wholeheartedly recommend: 
, 
and 
.
The short manifest digests most of the things you’d find in these books and – naturally – is inspirational as hell.
Great way to end a book on creativity and productivity!

How to Build a Rock-Solid Routine
Each of the four chapters comprising 
ends with a “Key Takeaways” section which briefly sums up the main bits of advice from the respective chapter.
So, basically, Glei and 99U did our job for us: thank you, Jocelyn!
As far as the process of building a rock-solid routine is concerned, these are the things you should remember:
• 
Do your most meaningful creative work at the beginning of your day, and leave “reactive work”—like responding to e-mail or other messages—for later.
• 
Establish “associative triggers”—such as listening to the same music or arranging your desk in a certain way—that tell your mind it’s time to get down to work.
• 
Commit to working on your project at consistent intervals—ideally every day—to build creative muscle and momentum over time.
• 
Move rhythmically between spending and renewing your energy by working in ninety-minute bursts and then taking a break.
• 
Make a point of spending some time alone each day. It’s a way to observe unproductive habits and thought processes, and to calm your mind.
• 
Show up, whether you feel inspired or not.
How to Find Focus in a Distracted World
Lost your focus amidst the buzzes and the hums of the 21
 century?
Counterpunch like a boss:
Book time on your calendar for uninterrupted, focused work—and respect those blocks of time as you would any client meeting.
Tackle the projects that require “hard focus” early in your day. Self-control—and our ability to resist distractions—declines as the day goes on.
Turn off your phone, e-mail, and any apps unrelated to your task. Even the presence of background activity (and temptation) can drain your focus.
Marking progress is a huge motivator for long-term projects. Make your daily achievements visible by saving iterations, posting milestones, or keeping a daily journal.
Alternate challenging creative work with more “mindless” tasks to give your brain time to rest and refuel.
Take a break from checking your smartphone during transitional moments, and open yourself up to opportunity and serendipity.
How to Tame Your Tools (Before They Tame You)
It’s inevitable: unless you tame your tools, they will probably tame you.
Here’s what you should do so that you’re always in control:
Post your complex, long-term goals by your workstation to keep them top of mind when prioritizing your tasks.
Practice letting go of certain e-mail and social media conversations. There will always be more opportunities than you actually can take on.
Distinguish between compulsive and conscious behaviors. Are you acting out of boredom or blind habit when you could be serving a higher goal?
Make a ritual of unplugging on a regular basis. Turning everything off is like hitting the “reset” button on your mind—it gives you a fresh start.
Be conscious of your body. Breathing deeply and regularly can decrease your stress levels and help you make better decisions.
Don’t trust technology over your own instincts and imagination. Doing busywork is easy; doing your best work is hard.
How to Sharpen Your Creative Mind
Nowadays, it’s almost expected from you to be creative all the time.
It’s a burden, all right – but you’ll manage it better if you follow these few suggestions:
Use personal creative projects to explore new obsessions, skills, or ways of working in a low-pressure environment.
Make time for your mind—and body—to wander when you’re stuck. Disengaging from the problem allows your subconscious to do its work.
Keep your inner perfectionist in check by defining what finished looks like at the beginning of a project. And when you get there, stop!
Repetition is the enemy of insight. Take unorthodox—even wacky—approaches to solving your stickiest problems and see what happens.
When the well runs dry, don’t blame a lack of talent. Creative blocks frequently piggyback on other problems. See if you can identify them.
Look at constraints as a benefit, rather than an impediment. They activate our creative thinking by upping the ante.

“Manage Your Day-to-Day Quotes”
Our Critical Review
When you think about it, 
 offers hardly any advice which you’d be inclined to call “new” or “original.”
However, it is difficult to say that it hasn’t gathered the best of the old ones at one place; to make matters better, they are all presented by a different thought leader of our day and age, which kind of gives them even more validity.
The effective structure, the clean and minimal design, and the Q&A sessions dispersed through every chapter make 
a “small gem of a book,” one “you can dip into whenever you need encouragement to get or keep yourself going.” (

Excellent both as a boost-your-own-productivity toolkit and as a gift for anyone who is on quest to achieve the same."

The book title itself erases all the BS that you would normally be subjected to and goes straight to the point.
Is it possible to snap out of this ignorance, and start embracing the thing you’ve been taught to fear?
Absolutely, and that’s precisely the thing we will be discussing in this summary.
Without further ado, let’s delve into Gary’s perspective about life!
Who Should Read “Unfuck Yourself”? And Why?
The first thing that sprinkles into our mind is everyone.
And why?
Is it because we are all fu*ked, or is it because we are brainwashed into believing that certainty is the pathway we should follow?
In “
” Gary paves the way for a new methodology to take its turn, composed of discomfort, restlessness, and risk-taking.
By the same token, we got the feeling that everyone would benefit from reading it and implementing some of the tips.

“Unfuck Yourself PDF Summary”
Are you ready to be woken up?
If you can get past the universal slap that you are about to receive, you’ll be able to make great things happen.
The little voice that keeps telling – “
” is about to test its own medicine.
Most people reckon that introverts, for instance, spend more time talking to each other than extroverts.
But that’s not quite true.
The latest psychological research has shown that the type of talk you are most like to engage in has a tremendous effect on your performance.
On top of that, there’s an unbreakable connection between what we say, and what we feel.
In all honesty, there are a lot of things that we do which can be labeled as irrational.
We do them anyways!
Dramatic self-talk can be best described as dis-empowering mind-chat which is out of keeping with common sense. 
Most people roam around demanding to be treated with respect and get all the acknowledgment they deserve. 
But it’s entirely ignorant to rely on other people, and 
; not to yourself.
What’s the easiest way to shape our thoughts?
Through, conscious and positive self-talk.
But sometimes we fall victims to our mindset and get pulled into this bubble. In an attempt to pop it, we might end up hurt as well.
But don’t feel discouraged, because you can steer your life in the way you deem fit by determining your emotions.
The way we talk, the way we move, the way we think forms our reality, and creates our future. The foundation of life rests on your shoulders, and you should seriously stop blaming luck and other people for your setbacks.
It’s even absurd saying this because it makes so much sense.
One of the most common mistakes most of us make is talking about what are we going to do, or what should we become.
Sometimes, all it takes is a little bit of faith to get things rolling.
You have to be willing before miracles happen!
Putting “Am I willing” in front of every question is a powerful exercise that gives you enough momentum to seize the day.
In reality, we often see 
 (a label) which could be put on the same page as being lazy, but that’s not always the case. A more reliable statement would include unwillingness as probably the only instigator of this sense of aimlessness. 
Usually, it takes some time to get the broader picture and being able to differentiate between the sense of eagerness and being evasive.
Perhaps, you need to work on your unwillingness, especially when you are about to put a statement forward while avoiding the red flags.
In this case, those signals are assimilated into our willingness/unwillingness to do what needs to be done. 
Let me give you an example:
I am willing to get this done; I am unwilling to stay in a job that I hate from the bottom of my heart. 
As you can see, expressing emotion can be a 
.
As of now, both assertions can be construed as a reward integrated into a caveat.
Okay, now for the big shock!
WTF?
Defining goals, is by far the most critical part of our lives, or is it? Is it enough to list a couple of goals, and look at them on a daily basis?
Let’s say that you want to be filthy rich, drive a Mercedes, live in a mansion and have more money than you can spend in your lifetime?
Now, for the responsibilities!
Are you ready to work 65-80 hours a week? Withstand the immense pressure of decision-making daily; skip vacations and exert yourself to complete the job, right now?
Ouu yeah, did you really think that you’ll be lying on a beach, with a tropical drink in your hand, while your army of highly-qualified but poorly paid workers and executives do the backbreaking work? Well, you must be living in the industrial era!
There’s a lot of social expectations out there, and it has produced a lot of unfulfilled and desperate humans. 
Nobody is saying that you shouldn’t aim for the stars!
Gary only implies that not all people wish to have that life and not wanting to sacrifice your freedom to be a millionaire is perfectly fine.
As a matter of fact, we only focus on the things we don’t have.
Your reality is not an outward reflection of your feelings, but an inner manifestation of your beliefs.
Face your reality, and try to subdue your addiction for certainty.
What addiction? – Allow us to explain!
It’s no secret that people are apt to embark on the safest path in an attempt to be out of harm’s reach. 
For instance, we buy the goods from brands we know, even though some alternatives offer the same quality for a lower price. On top of that, we date for months even years in order to secure our financial and reproductive future and reduce risk.
The reality you don’t want to be brought into is what we call a certain outcome – an addiction.
Bear in mind, that seeking safe harbor and shelter can be counterproductive for two obvious reasons:
Let’s unpack both of them.
Whether you are in a coffee shop or taking a morning jog, you cannot be certain about what’s going to happen. It’s within the uncertainty where we often find joy and concealed courage to do the inevitable. Besides, how many times a situation that heralded hopelessness turned out to be life-changing and productive? 
That’s why Gary reckons that wanting to tackle the uncertainty is not sustainable and can never be the instigator of success.
In addition to that – how many times, you decided to back out of something, in order not to be judged?
Well, as some sort of consolation prize, we can say that you are not the only one.
There are not a lot of people who have the winner’s edge, and those that do, are geared up with one particular asset – not fleeing from the field of judgment.
Step forward and be ready to take some punches!
If you want to win on the long-haul, you must grind the sense of certainty beneath your feet.
 – should be your mantra!
At this moment, you must be nodding your head as a token of approval, wanting to test this new medicine.
To truly excel, don’t shy away from opportunities and seize upon whatever life is throwing at you.
In other words, you should stretch your comfort zone, and try to see what’s behind the horizon.
Doing something completely different than what you are used to, could be the lifeline you’d be hoping to reach.
When the pursuit for certainty comes to a standstill, you’ll be able to see the bigger picture of life, often composed of things that you so casually disregarded before.
With this said, it’s time to identify the arch enemy; or the thing which impedes this transformation!
You are not required to do anything other than looking deep into yourself.
Your thoughts and the nurturing image you have of yourself is the instigator of this emotional malaise.
It’s impossible to police your thoughts and decide what goes in or out.
However, you are entitled to define your engagement with these sensations.
For example, you believe that successful people never doubt themselves, or never had experienced some personal crisis, but that’s far from the truth?
The only difference between you and them is in action.
While you lose focus and being 
, they act anyway.
You just need some willpower to perform bravely and put up a lot of work in the things that hold special meaning to you.
Of course, there will be periods when you’d be unwilling to go to work, or even get out of your bed, but that’s only normal.
Thoughts without actions are like cars without gas.
Unless you feed them with belief and take appropriate follow-up actions, they’ll vanish in the wind.
So, it’s you who decide, which thought should you act upon and which one should be neglected or cast aside.
And today you should do something that you wouldn’t normally do or endorse.
Get a different kind of breakfast, break words with someone or bypass the emotional burden that keeps sticking to the “known.”
Btw, have you ever given any second thought about people who could be regarded as successful?
They all had some issues, but that didn’t stop them from taking action.
It’s needless to say that great success is not born within the confines of the 
 but in the state of discomfort and uncertainty.
Remember this and understand that relentlessness is often misconstrued as some disobedience, contrary to the formula leading to prosperity. But those that took the path of skepticism were the ones that changed the world!
You want some good old fashioned piece of advice?
Stop doing all the shit you are not supposed to be doing, and start doing the shit you know you should be doing! 
Key Lessons from “Unfuck Yourself”
1.      Get out of your head
2.      Transform the meaningless into meaningful
3.      Do what needs to be done
Get out of your head
It might be a crazy thing to say – but for the time being, we would like you to stop paying so much attention to your thoughts.
To put it differently, you should really reconsider your priorities, by neglecting the harmful chatter that goes around in your head.
In doing so, you’ll be able to see opportunities where others see obstacles.
Transform the meaningless into meaningful
After all, is all about making that first step.
Whatever someone puts you down, it’s your job to make a life-lesson out of it, instead of sinking into deep dejection.
That is the process of transforming the hollow into substantial.
Do what needs to be done
More often than not, we kind of know what is required from us, but out of habit, we tend to deviate a bit.
Circumventing the problem is not an equal footing as finding a solution that could result in prosperity.
Therefore, stop with the procrastination and get it done!

Flow Summary,https://blog.12min.com/flow-mihaly-csikszentmihalyi-summary/,,"4 min read ⌚ 
Esteemed psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi brings together decades of research to lead us on our path to happiness. Read on to find out why 
is
one of Bill Clinton’s favorite books.
It doesn’t surprise us that this book is popular because Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi expertly combines general and scientific knowledge with a casual writing style. And then there’s the great content, too.
EFFORTLESS FLOWING / FLOW
Flow – happiness is attainable, no matter different cultures, physical condition, status or wealth, but requires work.
Csikszentmihalyi, originally from Eastern Europe, came to the United States to start a career in psychology. He was especially intrigued by the sense of meaning in general, and the meaning of life in particular.
The world needs your contribution! Not only for providing the society with a service, but also for yourself. So, an unhappy person is a pain for the society, if you don’t like your job – quit immediately. Have some pride, flow through life; do not swim. A worried person is detail-orientated if you are such change your surroundings. Follow the basic solution that Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi talks about.
GetNugget contributes as well to his theory by paying close attention to each step of this helpful process. The book “Flow” prompts one question – Do I need this suffering (referring to your job)? If you think you deserve better –  fight for it. Take what is yours rightfully! Push your mind to the limits, the only way for a person to become more productive is to feel self-satisfied. Depressed individuals can barely stand still. What steps should you take to find your contribution more valuable?
Transform your dull and routine life into something more dynamic. Perhaps, not too dynamic like some action movies, but creative enough to make you believe in something, live each day as if it was your last.
The book is split into the following chapters:
 is based on Csikszentmihalyi’s 20 years of research into the phenomenon of ‘flow’.  He observed the state of mind of artists, who are totally absorbed in their work when they create something.  He also asked artists, mountain climbers, workers, and athletes about their feelings when they created their own activities.
Besides interesting facts about history, philosophy, and science, we find out that the state of flow is an ancient philosophy, sometimes known as Ju or yoga.
This state of flow is present in all types of activity, everything from work and leisure to personal relationships. We’re interested in it because of its ability to make us happy. We all long for happiness but we have no clue where to find it; if we 
 find it, we usually don’t know how to keep it.
Think of all the advances of the last century, the scientific breakthroughs, the changes in technology, the diseases we wiped out, the growth of our economies and our wealth. Sure, divorce rates are at an all-time high. There are conflicts and terrorism, and we have yet to find a cure for cancer. But overall our standards of living have gone up. W can travel, we can share our favorite photos with the entire world, we can keep in touch with old friends who live thousands of miles away. So why aren’t we happy?
aims to teach us how to find happiness. We need more than just pure ambition to obtain it. It’s not possible to get it by force. We need several things to align in order to experience it, because:
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi explores the human mind, and what it needs to attain flow.
We can use the skills we possess to help direct our attention towards our goal. The process is guided by attention and sustained by energy. But enjoyment occurs just for those who are motivated by the pleasure of doing something, and not by external influence. The road towards our goal allows us to “flow” optimally and effortlessly. The higher the goal is, and the more effort you put into it, the more substantial and stable the growth.
We have the ability to experiment with a flow in almost every activity: through our senses; moving; creating; accomplishing basic physical needs or complex mental tasks – playing chess, solving crosswords; or spending time with friends and family. All these can be transformed into very enjoyable minutes or even hours. The choice is in our willpower.
The main benefit of the experience is that we acquire new skills, obtain a higher understanding of a situation, develop ourselves. It prepares us for the next challenge, tougher than the previous one, and the ability to enjoy the path we are following becomes easier. The quality of the goal determines your level of spirituality. With practice, we find we’re able to change our moods, the direction of our thoughts, and make them work for our benefit.
The process described in 
 by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi is further investigated for its use in several areas of human existence. One in particular, flow in work, has been developed and put into practice by many others.
Spending more time at work than at home means we have to create work places, environments, and conditions that bring us enjoyment and increases our performance. Specialists find it interesting that satisfaction in work doesn’t depend on position, reward, or environment, but rather on our ability to improve, to produce higher-quality work and enjoy what we do.
In chapter 9, “Cheating Chaos”, Csikszentmihalyi describes the research he carried out on people with physical disabilities. We hear stories of several of our peers, who were either in accidents or born with a disability. Their moods, work, and lives are the same as someone without a disability.
We can easily learn to find happiness if we accept and enjoy whatever life throws our way. It’s all about knowing ourselves and our limitations, and adjusting our goals."

Widely considered one of the greatest minds in history, Stephen Hawking left our planet on 14 March 2018, precisely 139 years after the birth of Albert Einstein.
is the last book he ever authored, his “parting gift to humanity.”
And if not for anything else – it’s worth all your time and energy just because of that.
Who Should Read “Brief Answers to the Big Questions”? And Why?
According to an NPR review, 
is “a book every thinking person worried about humanity’s future should read.”
We share the opinion.
However, in case you expected a different answer to the question from the title, we are willing to be a bit more precise.
So, if you want to know what Hawking thought about the existence of God, the Big Bang, black holes, Fermi’s paradox, future predictions, time travel, space colonization, AI, and/or our responsibilities in relation to the future of our planet – then this book is definitely for you.
Now, go back to the quote from the NPR review at the beginning of this section; that one sentence was enough, wasn’t it?
About Stephen Hawking
 was an English theoretical physicist and cosmologist, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge for the three decades between 1979 and 2009, director of research at Cambridge’s Centre for Theoretical Cosmology, and one of the most recognizable popularizers of science of the past century.
Born 300 years – to the day – after Galileo Galilei’s death, Hawking was a brilliant student, but he fell into a deep depression after he was diagnosed with the terminal Lou Gehrig’s disease (aka ALS or MND) when he was barely 21 years old.
Even though doctors predicted that he’d live no more than two years after the initial diagnosis, Hawking beat their forecasts by half a century, a period during which he developed a reputation as both an heir to Einstein and a leading public intellectual.
As a matter of fact, Hawking’s most well-known book, 
 – first published in 1988 – is one of the bestselling science books in history, having sold more than 15 million copies.
Ranked number 25 in BBC’s poll of the 100 Greatest Britons in history, Stephen Hawking is widely considered the most important theoretical physicist of the past half a century, and one of the most remarkable human beings who ever lived.

Is There a God?
It depends on what your definition of God is.
If you think of God as a humanlike sentient Being who’s omnipotent and omniscient – then, no, there’s certainly no God.
Or, better yet, even if there is, he has absolutely no explanatory value: the universe would have been exactly the same as it is even if he had never existed.
There are natural laws which govern everything and scientists throughout history have uncovered most of them, one by one, slowly but surely.
Now we know for sure that the same laws govern both the movement of a tennis ball and the movement of a planet.
There’s absolutely no evidence whatsoever that these laws are: a) local; b) breakable.
In other words, if God exists, he (or she) is also subject to this universal, permanent laws of nature.
“If you like,” writes Hawking, “you can call the laws of science ‘God,’ but it wouldn’t be a personal God that you would meet and put questions to. Although, if there were such a God,” he adds, “I would like to ask however did he think of anything as complicated as M-theory in eleven dimensions.”
We would too, Stephen, we would like too.
How Did It All Begin?
Well, you know the simple answer: with the Big Bang.
After Edwin Hubble discovered a century ago that the universe is expanding – 
 – we realized that at one point in time (think 15 billion years ago) the universe was nothing more than a single dot, the primeval atom, the Cosmic Egg.
This primeval atom was extremely dense and hot; everything came from it.
And when we say everything, we do mean “everything”: time-space included.
Of course, the fact that time and space are non-existent entities in a primeval atom (think of it as singularity: 
 and 
), it’s meaningless to ask what came before the Big Bang.
It’s the same as asking what is south of the South Pole.
The Big Bang is the beginning – since before it time (which exists only within our universe) didn’t exist.
Is There Other Intelligent Life in the Universe?
Have you ever heard of a little something called the Fermi paradox?
If not, here’s (more or less) how it goes:
• There are 200 billion stars in our galaxy only, the Milky Way;
• By all estimations, about 20 percent of them should have an Earth-like planet orbiting them in the Goldilocks zone, “where the distance from the star is in the right range for liquid water to exist on their surface;”
• In other words, there should be at least 40 billion potential Earths just in our cosmic neighborhood;
• Life appeared on Earth just half a billion years after the Earth became habitable – which happened 4 billion years ago, almost 10 billion years after the Universe was formed;
• If life needs so little time to appear on an Earth-like planet and if there are so many Earth-like planets around us – then where are the aliens?
Difficult to answer, but there are a few things to take into consideration here:
• First of all, there’s a difference between life and intelligent life;
• Multi-celled organisms appeared on Earth 2.5 billion years after the first single-celled organisms were formed;
• Asteroids and comets constantly slam planets; it is one of these (and a small one, mind you) that completely wiped out the dinosaurs (the dominant species at the time) about 70 million years ago.
So, in other words, we might have been lucky.
Life has probably appeared on many, many planets in our cosmic neighborhood; however, it’s difficult to say if on any of them it managed to evolve to an intelligent phase.
Its star might have become a red giant too early; asteroids might have destroyed its life forms.
Either way, even “if there is intelligent life elsewhere, it must be a very long way away otherwise it would have visited Earth by now.”
Can We Predict the Future?
“If at one time we knew the positions and speeds of all the particles in the universe,” noted once Pierre-Simon Laplace, “then we would be able to calculate their behavior at any other time in the past or future.”
In other words, if you know the precise speed of your car and the direction it is moving, you’d be able to correctly guess where it would be 30 minutes from now.
Interestingly enough, this is the 
 view of things: there’s nothing supernatural in the world, so in a way, everything should be predictable.
However, there are a few problems with this.
The two most critical: the chaos factor, and the quanta.
First of all, it is highly improbable that anyone would ever know the precise position and speed of all the articles in the universe; a butterfly flapping its wings in China can cause winds in LA on a March morning, but it may cause a thunderstorm on a June evening in NY.
Put simply: there are just too many variables and too many factors to be taken into consideration; calculations of this type, though theoretically conceivable, are impractical.
Did we say theoretically conceivable?
Well, 
, even that part is debatable; it seems that it is 
 for us to know both the correct speed and the correct position of any small particle.
Too bad, because we were really hoping to find something akin to Marty McFly’s sports almanac one day in the future.
Or the past.
It’s too complicated.
What Is Inside a Black Hole?
If you ever get there, please – be sure to tell us.
Unfortunately, you won’t be able to, because you’ll be either turned into spaghetti before reaching the horizon (if it is a stellar mass black hole) or be crushed out of existence at the singularity (if it is a supermassive black hole).
Just be sure to never reach the event horizon, aka the moment past which nothing – not even light – can escape the gravity of a black hole.
Think of it as going over the Niagara Falls in a canoe; until a certain point, if you paddle fast enough, you should be able to get away; however, once you are past the edge, there’s no way back for you.
To sum up:
If you want to explore the inside of a black hole, then be sure to choose a big one; however, you’ll be the only one to know what’s inside it – for a very small part of time, until, in a flash, time stops existing for you.
Is Time Travel Possible?
According to our present understanding of the universe, “rapid space travel and travel back in time can’t be ruled out.” 
In fact, the M-theory (“our best hope of uniting general relativity and quantum theory”) may allow for something as extraordinary and exciting as time travel.
However, if possible, time travel would cause serious logical problems, so Hawking really hopes that there’s some Chronology Protection Law we know nothing about as of yet.
Even so, he would be delighted if someone proves him wrong.
In fact, in 2009 he even held a party for time travelers in his college, Gonville and Caius in Cambridge.
To ensure that only genuine time travelers came, he didn’t send out the invitations until 
 the party.
Of course, no one came on the day of the party. 
“I was disappointed,” writes Hawking, “but not surprised, because I had shown that if general relativity is correct and energy density is positive, time travel is not possible. I would have been delighted if one of my assumptions had turned out to be wrong.”
Will We Survive on Earth?
 that there are events which are outside and events which are within our control; unfortunately, our life here on Earth is threatened by both.
The biggest threat is one we can do nothing about: an asteroid collision. “We have no defense against it,” says Hawking. “The last big such collision with us was about sixty-six million years ago, and that is thought to have killed the dinosaurs, and it will happen again. This is not science fiction; it is guaranteed by the laws of physics and probability.”
However, there are also two threats we are able to – and 
 – do something about: climate change and nuclear weapons.
Hawking, however, is only partially optimistic:
Should We Colonize Space?
If you read carefully Hawking’s quote above, then you already know the answer: of course, we should.
Otherwise, there’s a big chance that we don’t survive the next catastrophe, be it environmental or nuclear (god forbid that it is an asteroid!)
So, the question is not “should we colonize space?” but “how” and “when should we start taking the matters seriously?”
Hawking’s answers are “now” and “with concrete deadlines.”
In his opinion, our current goals of having a moon base by 2050 and a manned Mars landing by 2070 are possible and should be the introductory chapter to a Star-Trek-like future.
Who knows?
 when the first human colony on Mars is established.
Will Artificial Intelligence Outsmart Us?
As far as Hawking is concerned, even less fabulous than the 
 scenario for our future is the one depicted in 
.
Namely, if humans became intelligent creatures by continually adapting to change, and if AI means allowing computers to do the same, shouldn’t this lead to an advanced AI network reaching self-awareness sometime in the future?
Well, chances are: it 
.
However, this doesn’t mean that people should stop developing AI, because, on the other hand, it may also lead to an almost utopian future for humanity.
So, the conclusion: AI is capable of outsmarting us, so we must develop it with caution.
That was the essence of an open letter signed by Hawking, Elon Musk, and a host of AI experts in 2015, in which the leaders of today warned that unless AI is deployed warily, it can have a very adverse effect on the human race.
How Do We Shape the Future?
Asked “what world-changing idea, small or big, would you like to see implemented by humanity?” Hawking answers quite straightforwardly: 
“This is easy. I would like to see the development of fusion power to give an unlimited supply of clean energy, and a switch to electric cars. Nuclear fusion would become a practical power source and would provide us with an inexhaustible supply of energy, without pollution or global warming.”
Reminding us that “we never really know where the next great scientific discovery will come from, nor who will make it,” Hawking ends his book with a cheerful and buoyant cry addressed to just about everybody:

 describes himself as a “serial entrepreneur, rebellious marketer and technology expert.”
He has started and grown numerous in many branches, mostly IT, telecommunications and marketing.
His ability to turn a startup into a real competitor through evidence-based strategies and tactics showed itself best in the telecommunications industry when his company was named one of Australia’s fastest growing companies just four years after being founded – earning a spot on the coveted Business Review Weekly Fast 100 list.
An instant bestseller, 
is his debut book and his only publication so far.
“The 1-Page Marketing Plan PDF Summary”
Introduction
“If I had to summarize the essence of this book in one sentence,” writes Allan Dib at the very beginning of 
,
“it would be, ‘the fastest path to the money.’”
In other words, Dib is not interested in clichés such as “follow your passion,” “work hard,” “hire the right people,” blah blah blah.
He’s interested in real-world marketing strategies and tactics, because, after all, as Thomas Watson of IBM once famously said: “Nothing happens until a sale is made.”
It doesn’t matter how good your product is or how better your service than that of your competitors; it’s the people, the customers who need to know this so as your business could thrive; and the only way this could happen is if you manage to make a sale.
Think of it this way: no matter how good of a writer you are, unless readers share this opinion, it wouldn’t matter not one bit.
And this is why it’s important to make a distinction between what is strategy and what is tactics. “Understanding the difference between strategy and tactics,” writes Dib, “is absolutely key to marketing success.”
In a nutshell, “
;” and tactics, on the other hand, is putting the strategy into practice.
Planning how your house would look like and getting the necessary building permits is strategy; hiring the plumber and buying the exact number of bricks is tactics.
Naturally, one can’t do with the other.
Strategy without tactics leads to paralysis by analysis.
“No matter how good the builder and the architect are,” writes Dib, “the house isn’t going to get built until someone starts laying bricks. At some stage, they’re going to need to say, ‘OK the blueprint is now good, we’ve got all the necessary approvals to build so let’s get started.’”
Tactics without strategy leads to “bright shiny object syndrome.”
Dib’s perfect analogy?
“Imagine you started building a wall without any plans and then later found out that it was in the wrong place, so you start pouring the foundation, and then you find out it’s not right for this type of house, so you start excavating the area where you want the pool, but that isn’t right either. This clearly isn’t going to work.”
The problem?
This is exactly how many business owners do marketing: “They string together a bunch of random tactics in the hope that what they’re doing will lead to a customer. They whack up a website without much thought, and it ends up being an online version of their brochure, or they start promoting on social media because they heard that’s the latest thing and so on.”
The solution?
Consider the 1-Page Marketing Plan your way out of a pickle such as the one described above; it is a manual on how to build the right marketing strategy so you can start putting it into practice.
The 1-Page Marketing Plan consists of three major phases, each of which consists of three minor parts. Dib’s book is a thorough, step-by-step guide through each of these stages, leaving no stones unturned and no questions unanswered.
So you can find your way around the book better, here’s a blank template of the 1-Page Marketing Plan. By the end of the summary, you’ll understand what each of these squares means and how you should fill it before doing anything in terms of marketing.
Act I: The “Before” Phase
The “before” phase is all about prospects:
One of the main mistakes most businesses make is targeting everyone; of course, this eventually backfires and results in no customer conversions.
Not to mention in a loss of a lot of money as well.
The trick is to market your products to a niche.
First of all, because as humans we value specialists much more than jack-of-all-trades; the latter is pejorative for a reason.
Secondly, being a big player in a small niche is much better than being a small player in a the great outdoors; to quote our favorite “misquoter” Michael Scott: instead of being a little fish in a big pond, be the top dog in a fairly large pond; the dog is the real boss.
Of course, merely saying that you should market to a niche isn’t enough; you need to choose the right niche for you.
To do this, Allan Dib proposes Dr. Frank Kern’s 
 (Kern is an attorney at law and chief engineer with NASA) which allows you to give each market segment you serve a rating between 1 and 10 and decide according to the final score.
PVP stands for:
: How much do you enjoy dealing with this type of customer? 
: How much does this market segment value your work? Are they willing to pay you a lot of $$$ for your work?
: How profitable is the work you do for this market segment? Remember it’s not about the “turnover,” it’s all about the “left over.”
Another great tool for getting into the mind of your prospects is becoming one of them temporarily.
Yes, we’re talking about creating avatars, “the marketing equivalent of method acting.”
With method acting you win Oscars; with avatars – customers.
Most advertising is – according to Dib – “boring, similar and useless.” In the end, it all comes down to a simple formula: company name + company logo + a laundry list of services offered + claims of best quality, best service or best prices + offer of a “free quote” + contact details.
If you want to stand out from the crowd, this is not the way to go!
It’s time you start marketing the way people play chess: purposefully, with a very concrete beforehand strategy in mind. 
Dib’s rule of thumb is one ad, one objective; you have to be clear on the purpose of your ad and only then make it.
It’s wrong to try to sell through the ad: the ad should only intrigue and invite the customers to find out more; nobody would buy something from someone who sells something in general terms and through a boring ad.
Speaking of – quality and service are too abstract and too expected to be part of your ad; you need to have a 
; this is how you stand out.
Include in your ad an elevator pitch: people don’t buy products but solutions to problems; it is the latter you need to pinpoint in your ad; target the prospect’s pain and focus on the benefits of your products.
People are much more willing to pay for the cure than for prevention, so targeting existing pain results in much higher conversion than promising a bright future.
Choose a relevant name for your product; think of it this way: if you need to explain it, then you’ve made the wrong choice.
What gets measured – gets managed. 
Unfortunately, “the reality is that most small businesses do little if any tracking of advertising. Not measuring where your leads and sales come from and not tracking ROI on ad spend is the mark of the amateur.”
ROI, of course, stands for return on investment. Not knowing the numbers that matter – customer lifetime value and acquisition cost – means not knowing whether you’re losing or earning money through your advertising campaign.
Neither Dib nor we have to tell you that we live in the 21
 century and that 
. 
However, don’t think of social media as a selling environment; think of it as a way to create and manage customer relationships and turn them into something more for you, aka financial benefit.
Of course, that means that whether on Facebook or on Twitter, whether through emails or SMS, you need to act as a friend to these people and not as a marketing rep.
Be conversational, engaging, give valuable information.
Also, complement email with snail mail; it may sound regressive, but it works – especially if it’s what makes you different from your competition.
How would you feel if you receive a postcard from a business? Wouldn’t you be a bit more connected to it on an emotional level, even if merely subconsciously?
Act II: The “During” Phase
If the “before” phase was about prospects, the “during” phase is about leads:
As we said above, selling directly from your ad is wrong, dead wrong! And this is because “the vast majority will not be ready to make a purchasing decision on the very day they read your ad—even if they are interested in what you do.”
Why?
Because the market for your product or service usually looks like this:
If you’re selling through your ad you’re basically targeting only the 3% who are ready to buy immediately, and you’re missing out on at least 37% of your audience!
And you can go from 3% to 40% – increasing the effectiveness of your advertising by 1,233% – through an 
.
An ethical bribe is something free which helps you generate leads; if someone takes it, then he’s identifying himself as one of the 37% your sell-immediately ad won’t reach out to.
Don’t be a hunter, says Allan Dib, because that means you’re in a constant battle to be successful: if you don’t kill something today, there won’t be a lunch for your family.
Be a farmer: plant the seeds, water them, and tend to your crop; then – start harvesting!
Apparently, half of the salespeople give up after one contact, 65% give up after two and four-fifths give up after three shots.
However, farmers don’t work like that: they water their seeds over and over again until they either produce or die.
That’s what nurturing leads boils down to: evolving from a pest to a welcome guest by being persistent. Becoming a factor in the lead’s mind requires at least five contacts; after the ninth, you have a 90% chance of being called:
“Sales conversion,” writes Allan Dib, “is all about creating enough trust and demonstrating enough value to motivate interested leads to become paying customers.”
Of course, this starts with positioning. If a boxer is too eager to attack, he will probably lose the match; if you’re too eager to sell, you’ll lose the trust of the customer.
Build the trust by delaying the sale and providing your customer with valuable information throughout; this will position you as someone of value in his/her mind.
Another thing that should help you is understanding the common fears of your customers; if you can address them before the sale, then you have a very tangible 
.
Also: never give your prospects and leads too many options; this results in paralysis by analysis and lack of a final decision.
Giving your leads only two or three options and pricing is the best way to go; especially if you can combine this with a “try before buy” sample.
Act III: The “After” Phase
Finally, the “after” phase is all about 
:
Good businesses have customers; great businesses have raving fans.
Building 
 requires commitment and awareness that the final goal is not to convert a prospect into a customer; but a customer into a raving fan.
To do so, you need to: 
• Continually focus on wowing your customers;
• Attempt to create and foster lifetime relationships;
• Make it easy and fun to deal with you;
• Create a sense of theatre around your products and services (remember Apple’s 1984 ad?);
• Build systems which will guarantee that you’ll reliably and consistently deliver a great experience.
Remember 
?
The main point of that story is that, if you’re looking for a treasure, it’s probably best to start looking for it in your own backyard.
That’s Dib’s marketing advice as well: “Most businesses have a rich ‘diamond mine’ in the form of existing customers which remains largely untapped, yet they leave this ‘family’ of existing customers after the first few transactions and spend all their marketing energy, money, and resources on seeking new sources of revenue.”
This is wrong!
Because your existing customers will accept almost anything from you if you turn them into raving fans.
For example, do you know that “Would you like fries with that?” is responsible for hundreds of millions of McDonald’s dollars on a yearly basis?
Why?
Because of what Cialdini calls in 
 “the contrast principle,” aka upselling. If you’re buying a suit, then two more shirts seem comparatively cheaper, and you’d have no problem buying them as well; it’s difficult the other way around.
Use the logic of upselling to your benefit; raise your prices and make your products more exclusive; even better, move your existing customers to your higher priced products and services (ascension).
Increasing the frequency with which your customers buy from you through reminders, vouchers, or subscriptions is another way to go.
Finally, you should never underestimate a reactivating campaign: your past customers can also be your future raving fans if you play your cards right.
Relying on “word for mouth” referrals is not that dissimilar from hoping for a free lunch to feed your family; Allan Dib is adamant: systems create great businesses.
And when it comes to referrals, there are a few things you should have in mind.
The most important one?
People refer a company to other people not because they want to help the company but because they want to help their friends or loved ones.
That’s why a good strategy to get a referral is if you offer an existing customer a gift or a voucher for his/her friends or family.
Asking for a referral before delivering a result is like asking for a kiss the first second of a blind date: it makes you look bad.
However, asking a referral after delivering the goods may even make your customer feel closer to you; sometimes this works even better than offering a percent for a referral; the latter is a business transaction, but the former a friendly engagement.
And marketing is about your customers’ emotions; even if it sometimes means toying with them.
Key Lessons from “The 1-Page Marketing Plan”
1.      The “Before” Phase: Dealing with Prospects
2.      The “During” Phase: Dealing with Leads
3.      The “After” Phase: Dealing with Customers
The “Before” Phase: Dealing with Prospects
The 1-Page Marketing Plan consists of three phases.
The “before” phase is the one in which you’re dealing with prospects, people that may not even know that you exist.
In this phase, your job is to select your target market (always a niche), craft your message (never unoriginal) and deliver this message through the advertising media (don’t sell through your ad!)
The goal is to make yourself familiar to your prospects and inspire them to respond to your message; once they do this, they’ve become leads, and you’re ready for Phase #2.
The “During” Phase: Dealing with Leads
The second phase, aka the “during” phase, is all about the leads – the people who have indicated some kind of interest in the products and/or services you offer.
To capture them, you need to ethically bribe them and nurture them with regular value-building information; only after delaying the sale, you’ll be ready to make it.
And that is the goal of this phase: turning your leads into customers.
The “After” Phase: Dealing with Customers
Of course, that is not the end of your marketing journey: now you need to turn these customers into raving fans, get their money, and inspire them to refer you to other people.
You do this by delivering a world-class experience and turning yourself into a tribe leader capable of increasing customer lifetime value and orchestrating and stimulating referrals.
This, finally, results in an ongoing “virtuous cycle” which is the way a good business becomes a great one.

Feeling like you’re too nice for your own sake?
Dr. Robert A. Glover would like to quote Alice Cooper for you:
.
Who Should Read “No More Mr. Nice Guy”? And Why?
If you think that you’re giving more than you’re receiving and you are afraid that you’ve neither lived up to your full potential nor built a stable and loving relationship, then 
 is definitely the book for you.
Think of it as a more rational and less misogynistic version of 
.
For Nice Guys.
About Dr. Robert Glover
 is an American author and speaker, “an internationally recognized authority on the Nice Guy Syndrome.”
He is a frequent guest on radio talk shows and has been featured in many publications, dubbed “emerging figure in the Men’s Movement” by 
 
 and “a psychology guru” by 
 is his only book so far.

“No More Mr. Nice Guy PDF Summary”
The Nice Guy Syndrome
According to Dr. Robert Glover, there are many men who “believe that if they are ‘good’ and do everything ‘right,’ they will be loved, get their needs met, and have a problem-free life.”
He calls these men Nice Guys, and he thinks that they are everywhere (
).
You’ll see them in your relative who lets his wife run the show or in your buddy who’s always there for everyone though his life is in shambles.
You’ll also see them in the guy who never says “no” to anyone and has absolutely no time for himself, and in the man who lets people walk all over him because he doesn’t want to rock the boat.
Finally, you’ll see him in the mirror if you can describe yourself along these lines.
“Every Nice Guy is unique,” writes Glover, “but all have a cluster of similar characteristics. These traits are the result of a ‘script,’ often formed in childhood, that guides their lives. While other men may have one or two of these traits, Nice Guys seem to possess a significant number.”
And here they are:
• 
. Nice Guys believe – and frequently state – that helping other people makes them feel better and happier;
• 
. Even without being asked, Nice Guys often try to fix other people’s problems, regardless of the type or severity.
• 
. The universal trait: everything a Nice Guy does or says is at some level calculated to gain someone’s approval or avoid disapproval; and that someone is often a woman.
• 
. Nice Guys hate when things are not running smoothly.
• 
. These men are afraid that others will get mad at them, shame them, or leave them if some mistake or shortcoming is exposed.
• 
. They believe there 
 such a thing.
• 
. Nice Guys tend to analyze rather than feel. 
• 
. Because oftentimes, they had been neglected by them.
• 
 See above.
• 
. These men often feel that it is selfish to put their needs first.
• 
 Many Nice Guys report that they are only happy if their partner is happy. 
OK, you say, I know quite a few people who share at least half of the characteristics above, but they are, well, Nice Guys.
What’s wrong with being a Nice Guy?
Well, in a nutshell, it’s utterly unhealthy; 
, and Nice Guys are actually Nice merely on the surface. 
Below it, most of them share at least some of these Not-So-Nice Traits:
• 
. Hiding your mistakes, repressing your feelings and avoiding conflict by saying what people want to hear (and not what you want to say) makes you a dishonest person, doesn’t it?
• 
.
• 
 They harmonize contradictory pieces of information about themselves by separating them into individual compartments of the mind.
• 
. Since they don’t want to ask what they actually want explicitly, Nice Guys frequently resort to manipulation when trying to get their needs met.
• 
. 
• 
. Though they are generous givers, they also expect something in return; and they feel really hurt when they get little or nothing.
• 
. Nice Guys express their frustrations and resentment in indirect, roundabout, and not so nice ways (being late, forgetting, not following through, etc.)
• 
. Because they repress so much, Nice Guys are ticking bombs.
• 
. 
• 
. They don’t know the words “no,” “stop,” or “I’m going to.” 
• 
. 
• 
. 
• 
 
 
. Despite their talent, they fail to live up to their potential.
So, what to do?
Well, recovery from the Nice Guy Syndrome, writes Dr. Glover, “isn’t about going from one extreme to another. The process of breaking free from ineffective Nice Guy patterns doesn’t involve becoming ‘not nice.’ Rather, it means becoming ‘integrated.’”
Not really sure about what an integrated male is?
Here are a few attributes so that you understand better:
• He has a strong sense of self. He likes himself just as he is.
• He takes responsibility for getting his own needs met.
• He is comfortable with his masculinity and sexuality.
• He has integrity. He does what is right, not what is expedient.
• He is a leader. He is willing to provide for and protect those he cares about.
• He is clear, direct and expressive of his feelings.
• He can be nurturing and giving without caretaking or problem-solving.
• He knows how to set boundaries and is not afraid to work through conflict.
In short, “an integrated male doesn’t strive to be perfect or gain the approval of others. Instead, he accepts himself just as he is, warts and all. An integrated male accepts that he is perfectly imperfect.”
The Making of a Nice Guy
Now, why are some guys nice, when, on the surface, it seems evolutionary pointless?
In other words, why should some people invest so much energy to become something that they are not when this brings them nothing but rage, anger, and disappointment in return?
Sure, there are benefits to being manipulative when it brings you money, glory, or sexual partners; but Nice Guys get nothing even remotely similar to this; on the contrary, in fact – they lose almost everything.
So, why do Nice Guys exist in the first place?
Glover’s response:
In a way, the Nice Guy is an evolutionary mistake: the result of the misinterpretation of some childhood experiences and the misuse of some survival mechanisms.
Namely, Nice Guys have usually experienced abandonment in their early years and do not want to live through that experience again.
Since they blame themselves for it, in their adulthood they think along the lines of this faulty logic: IF I can hide my flaws and become what I think others want me to be THEN I will be loved, get my needs met, and have a problem-free life.”
Nice Guys hide their true selves from the world because they believe that their true selves 
 the problem; and, thus, they make the problem worse.
Learn to Please the Only Person Who Really Matters
The process of becoming an integrated male starts with a rather simple question: dear Mr. Nice Guy, how would you live your life if you cared not one bit about other people’s thoughts and feelings about you?
The same question can be reused in relation to Nice Guy’s relationships: what would you do differently in your relationships (be it with women or friends) if you weren’t interested in the approval of other people?
Because Nice Guys have got it all wrong: you shouldn’t change yourself to deserve other people’s approval, but you should spend your life around people who’d approve you just the way you are.
“Nice Guys find many creative ways to cover up their perceived flaws and mistakes,” notes Dr. Glover, and these are not limited to lying and fixing.
For example, most Nice Guys go into DEER Response mode whenever they do something wrong or fail to do something right and are subsequently confronted by their partners, friends, or bosses.
DEER is an acronym which stands for Defend, Explain, Excuse, Rationalize – four fear-based behaviors which feed the Mr. Nice Guy persona on a daily basis.
Becoming an integrated male starts with identifying the moments when you resort to these behaviors and try to do everything in your power to prevent yourself from acting them out.
You don’t have to excuse yourself for 98% of the things you excuse yourself for; you are not a bad person, and it’s only normal to believe that your dreams and desires are more important than the dreams and desires of everyone else.
Everybody does that.
And until you harm someone, you should also do everything within your power to making your dreams come true.
Once again, 
 does that.
Make Your Needs a Priority and Reclaim Your Personal Power and Masculinity
, Cormac McCarthy says that it’s pointless and ludicrous to spend your only life here on earth doing something you don’t want to do.
As he says, “being able to live your life and being able to do what you want to do” should be your number 1 priority.
And unless you make it so, nobody else is going to do it for you; you are responsible for what’s happening to you, and you need to start taking actions if you want good things to come your way.
Be assertive and stop acting like you’re the victim; start expressing your feelings and start setting boundaries; don’t treat people and circumstances like problems that need to be fixed: see them as merely people and circumstances.
That way, it’d be easier for you to walk away from them when things get rough; life is messy, and sometimes they do; however, this doesn’t mean that it’s your responsibility to fix them.
End bad relationships and start new ones; it’d be better both for you and your partner.
Reclaim your personal power. If you need a summary, always remember that it is a six-step process which includes:
• Surrendering.
• Dwelling in reality.
• Expressing feelings.
• Facing fears.
• Developing integrity.
• Setting boundaries.
Key Lessons from “No More Mr. Nice Guy”
1.      Nice Guys Are Actually Not-So-Nice
2.      In a Way, Nice Guys Are Evolutionary Mistakes
3.      The World Belongs to the Integrated Males: Become One
Nice Guys Are Actually Not-So-Nice
How many times have you heard something similar to: “But how could that happen? He seemed like such a nice guy…”
Probably one too many.
Why?
Because Nice Guys are usually, under the surface, not so nice.
The fact that they are constantly helping other people, trying to fix situations and repress their own feelings and needs takes its toll in time and results in them becoming passive-aggressive and angry individuals who feel as if some kind of cosmic injustice has been done to them.
And that’s when things fall apart.
In a Way, Nice Guys Are Evolutionary Mistakes
Boys become Nice Guys not because they want to become nice, but because they believe that this is the only way for them to get the approval they lack.
Usually, Nice Guys feel abandoned in their formative years and grow up believing that this is their fault.
Their way to cope with it?
To hide who they really are. 
In their mind, the things they did when children – and when feeling like themselves – were wrong and now, if they do everything differently, they’d probably get the problem-free, conflict-less life they’ve been dreaming about.
Of course, it doesn’t work that way!
The World Belongs to the Integrated Males: Become One
Nice Guys, says Dr. Glover, do not evolve by becoming the opposite of what they are – aka Not Nice Guys – but by becoming Integrated Males.
Integrated Males like themselves just as they are and take responsibility for their own needs; they are comfortable with their masculinity and sexuality and do what they believe is right, not what is expedient.
They are clear, direct, and expressive, and willing to protect those they care about in a much more direct no-nonsense way.
Finally, they are also caring; Nice Guys confuse caring and caretaking, but Integrated Males are almost never caretakers.
And that’s a great thing!

Millionaire Success Habits PDF Summary,https://blog.12min.com/millionaire-success-habits-pdf-summary/,https://blog.12min.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image1-5.jpg,"8 min read ⌚ 
Not everyone aspires to become a millionaire, but those that do, have several things in common.
Among other things, they have that solution-focused mentality.
If you lust for success, then this is the step-by-step process that explains how to get there.
Who Should Read “Millionaire Success Habits”? And Why?
Who wouldn’t want to become a millionaire?
Well, probably there are some who are not interested in it, but in general, people have this natural inclination to improve their status.
After conducting all-inclusive research, Dean was able to deliver a comprehensive blueprint which depicts the habits that are cultivated by millionaires.
About Dean Graziosi
 is a writer, entrepreneur and the founder of Motor Millions.
So far, he has written four books:
 “Millionaire Success Habits PDF Summary”
Apparently, Dean exerts himself to find the million-dollar formula, mostly by placing emphasis on empirical data, analysis, and research. 
On top of that, he gives a critical review of what could be a game-changer in the following years. 
Productivity, the much-vaunted element in today’s society is receiving a hard blow.
While on the topic, Dean points out that productivity and wages are not going up proportionally, and we need to find out why.
The 45-degree slope in the sketch is definitely a blow to the believers in the “hard-working” philosophy.
What does this discovery reveal?
It literally means that we get many things done, but that doesn’t reflect on wages and working conditions.
It seems as if the middle-class is being pushed aside, and squeezed out of society.
And yes, 
.
Being wealthy or acquiring wealth should not be regarded as some dirty business. People these days, have this natural disgust for rich folks because they reckon that filling one’s pockets can only be done at the expense of others.
Don’t forget that being rich, or just getting to the middle class can make a lot of difference. Truthfully, it’s not the only antidote, but it shouldn’t be discarded that easily as well.
Simply put – regardless of how you perceive the money-making world, this is the best time for getting your hands onto the things you crave for. 
Millionaires employ thousands of people, and their contribution to the economy is by no means superficial. 
The social dogma permeating today’s society suggests that millionaires and money, in general, are evil concepts. But, it’s proven that a little bit of extra money can make your life a whole lot easier.
So why all the hate?
Because we have abandoned the wheel! We have left behind the world of achievement and productivity, and made a U-turn.
And what’s worse, we have no idea where are we headed to. 
It’s like a drunkard roaming around, purposelessly.
Most of the time, we hear people complaining about the lack of time and the inability to improve their 
. 
The problem is not in the dearth of time, but having ill-defined goals or not having any whatsoever. 
When you are put in this bubble, there’s very little you can do to improve your status. Not that the world doesn’t give you opportunities, but because you have no clear vision of how you would like to structure your life.
We’ve heard it like a million times that setting goals is the backbone of success, but many of us seem to skip this step.
So, with that said, here’s the typical goal-setting process:
If you consider all of the elements, you’ll definitely see signs of improvements in next to no time. 
Now you are good to go!
With that figured out, now it’s time to face your worst enemy.
Self-doubt probably takes the pedestal, and it’s almost always concealed and sneaky. In other words, it’s hard to spot by any stretch of the imagination. 
The inner voice that constantly keeps telling you that you are not good enough has taken a toll on your progress.
As an illustration, let’s do the following scenario:
You have two wolves living inside you. One of them is greedy, malevolent, and needy. The other one is emphatic, compassionate, loving and positive.
They are constantly at each other’s throats, battling for influence.
So, which one of these wolves will survive and win the fight?
Obviously, the one you feed with your attention and energy. As you might have guessed the villain is brought to life by you and the concepts you believe in – basically your past.
The negativity we talk about is the main culprit with regards to wars, terrorism, corruption; you name it. 
It’s the other wolf that sparks all the conflict in the world and sets things on fire.
The self-made villain thrives when you put energy into things that are superficial in its essence. It tends to remind you about your doubts, weaknesses and keep you docile.
It may come as a shock to you, but there’s only a small percentage of people who can withstand this pressure and get things rolling on the right foot.
Dean even declares:
With that said, we kind of get this itchy feeling that society doesn’t want you to prosper.
Many people, probably even you at some point in their lives had an awesome idea. The Eureka moment was brought to its knees by those who we regard as our closest circle. Deliberately or not, our dreams were shattered by the voice of mediocrity.
As you can see, bad advice is literally the costliest thing on the market, and yes we are getting piles of it.
In order to fight off this tendency, you must be on full alert 24/7 for things that could impede your rise to the top.
Another thing you need to be wary of is to never take advice from people who have failed in accomplishing the thing you would like to excel at.
It’s just common sense, and yet many people are hurting themselves by doing otherwise.
When you jump on the latest bandwagon and follow the same logic as a society, you’re not paving the way for glory.
In today’s world, it’s so hard to be yourself, that we almost made it a crime.
People are taught to blend in, and never deviate from the known.
Words, uttered or not can cause a lot of damage, and that’s why you have to be so careful. You ought to choose them carefully, and dis-empower the negative connotation that floats with them.
So, how can you win this game?
By awakening the inner hero that’s already inside you.
Without confidence, you’ll never take the right action, and without action, you cannot achieve results. Some believe that being a hero requires admiration or supporters, but NO! 
Not being someone else’s hero, but one to yourself.
Whenever you allow the inner hero to take the driver’s seat, you are much more likely to experience success on all fronts.
The solution-focused mentality is what drives the winners, and it’s precisely the thing that your inner villain despises.
The strangest thing is – you either have a lot of confidence or close to none.
Like, there’s no middle ground whatsoever!
The hero is not a pompous jerk, who pretends to know everything about anything. It’s a dedicated, goal-oriented driving-force that opposes the negative mindset which is omnipresent.
Let’s take a closer look at the 4 C’s of confidence:
There’s one simple exercise that could help you 
.
It’s the process of telling yourself – 
. 
If you can pluck up your courage, in the worst moments of your life, you can literally win over anything.
It’s not so much about saying it, as it is about believing in it and having that determination to get past this phase no matter what.
All of a sudden, the sky will open up, and you’ll be free of those limiting concepts.
When it comes to adopting the right habits, Dean shares a glimpse of his 25-year entrepreneurial journey and shows what predicts success in the workplace.
The first thing is to be passionate about what you do.
Next, list your money goals.
And last but not least, take a moment to delve into how you can achieve those goals.
Bad habits can be replaced or changed when you can identify them. 
That’s why there are no entrepreneurs who hate what they do. You’ll find them all fired up, ready to take the next step and seize the day.
Obviously, there’s no such thing as a money-making machine, and you should not lean on it.
And yes, even at the top you’ll face challenges and dangers, but it’s all part of the growth curve.
Now, you’ve identified the opportunities disguised as obstacles, so now what do we do?
It’s now the right time to think about time management.
If you can allocate your time and efforts effectively, you’ll be able to get more things done.
In the quest for money and success, we often forget about the crucial ingredients: attraction and persuasion. 
Key Lessons from “Millionaire Success Habits”
1.      Make things happen
2.      There’s no tomorrow

Make things happen
Sitting and scratching your head over problems won’t make them disappear. 
It’s of utmost importance to stand up, diagnose the situation, and take appropriate follow-up actions. 
Most of the time, we would rather take the passive approach, and watch it from the side.
Truthfully, you must be decisive in your execution!
There’s no tomorrow
Stop with the procrastination once and for all.
It’s time to understand that miracles happen in the “Now” and never in the later.
So, tackle the destructive thoughts that keep telling you otherwise.
Find your “Why”
The analogy behind this lesson indicates that without knowing your bearings, you will get lost.
So, stop roaming around, and define your purpose.
By doing so, you’ll get the wind at your back to do all the things that should be doing.

When a book has a subtitle such as the one above, you don’t really need an intro, do you?
This one’s for all the men and women out there thinking:
Who Should Read “But I’m Not an Expert!”? And Why?
We’ve already told you that 
, but, let’s face it: in a world as dynamic and as competitive as ours, unless you are one, you’ll have troubles finding a job, let alone making a name.
Meera Kothand’s book is a great “step-by-step roadmap” which should guide you, from your modest beginnings as an inexperienced amateur (aka position sub-zero), to the supreme heights of your field’s authority ladder (aka “when everybody knows your name.”)
Not that you need it, but to quote the blurb:
“If you’ve ever said the words ‘But I’m not an expert!’ this book is for you.”

“But I’m Not an Expert PDF Summary”
Positioning: Picking Your Expert Niche
Let’s start by highlighting the most important word in the title: 
.
It’s the 21
 century, after all, so if you’re not thinking in terms of niches, then you’re not thinking about becoming an expert!
Gone are the days when one could be just an expert in literature – now is the time when you have no choice but to try to become an expert in Shakespeare, or, even more, an expert in Shakespeare’s view on women. (By the way, he was probably a misogynist.)
Well, business is no different than literary studies: if you want to attract an audience, you need to choose a niche and develop your skills in that direction.
The Venn diagram below should help you choose your expert niche:
As you can see from the image, it’s not all passion and perseverance: you have to find a way to combine these with the needs of the market.
In other words, you’ll be stuck with a hobby which you won’t be able to ever monetize unless you find a marketplace for your ideas and passions.
Or, in Meera Kothand’s words:
Now, what’s a hungry market, you ask?
It’s the market in the direction of which the money is flowing.
So, in a nutshell, if you notice that someone is paying money for a product or a service and you have some idea, knowledge, interest in these products or services – then, go for it!
That’s your niche.
Your expert niche.
Content: Staking Claim to Your Expert Status with Knowledge
Staking claim to your expert status is all about knowledge; and knowledge – in the online world – is all about creating and curating valuable content.
The first thing you need to learn: value is 
 “massive free guides, downloads, lengthy how-to content, and tutorials.”
It is more than that:
Changing perception and mindsets? Adding to the body of literature in the niche?
Considering the fact that there are probably hundreds of articles on any given topic already, this is practically impossible!
It is not, says Meera.
She agrees that “nothing is original” and that “pretty much everything has been done.” However, she also suggests that you need to start thinking in terms of differentiating instead of originality: “The idea is not to be radically original,” she writes. “The idea is to differentiate yourself.”
According to Meera, there are three characteristics of content which are universally deemed valuable; she calls them content levers and thinks that each one of your articles should be definable along their lines.
So, in other words, your article will be valuable if it:
: myths are there to be broken, and experts are, more often than not, MythBusters; question the sacred cows in your niche;
: don’t muddle things up; even if polarizing (maybe even: 
 then) be as clear as you can be; however, if you don’t have arguments, be aware that you’re doing nothing more than ranting;
: valuable articles answer questions everybody asks, and nobody has answered as clearly as expected.
These are the four types of articles “that work really well to claim expert status.” Meera Kothand offers an example for each of them authored by her – and we think it’s only just to 
The marketing funnel includes no less and no more than five different types of people; it’s your goal to transform the first type among them (strangers) into the last one (customers and brand advocates).
And here’s how you can do that:
As you can see yourself from the graph above, the middle of the marketing funnel may be its most important part, aka it’s most difficult to turn a stranger into a reader/subscriber.
Afterward, it’s far easier to convert a subscriber into an engaged subscriber/customer.
So, don’t rush to the bottom of the funnel.
Be careful and make your progress toward your brand advocates step-by-step: slowly, but surely.
Authority: Leveraging the Authority Architecture
Meera Kothand defines authority as “the ability to get others to listen to you.”
Of course, everybody has the dream of achieving something of that sort, but not everybody is capable to; especially if you’re starting from scratch, this may seem as not merely difficult, but all but unattainable.
However, Kothand believes that you can do it!
Once again, you need to go slowly, and step by step.
To get featured on authority sites and podcast (aka, to borrow authority), you just need to follow these simple seven steps:
This should be easy: just make a list of sites/podcasts you want to be featured in.
See
how many of these sites are still active and have recent posts; find out whether they have a large audience; eliminate those who don’t.
Keep a running list of the remaining sites, featuring this information: URL, link to guest posting guidelines and the name and email of the one you should send your pitch to; then prioritize the sites based on their followers and difficulty to have your guest post published.
This is the most important part: create valuable tailor-made content the sites would wish to publish.
Share their content on social media or within your content; show off your expertise by commenting on their blogs or podcasts.
Send an email: be concise and straight-to-the-point; show your familiarity with the host’s work and make sure that your blog post adheres to the host’s guidelines.
Add author bio and links to your site; create a custom 
 for the audience of your host’s site/podcasts.
Of course, in addition to borrowing authority, you can also build one. A great way to do this is by solving a specific problem in your niche through a challenge.
If you don’t know what a challenge is, here’s Meera’s definition:
Once again, if you want to be successful, just follow these seven simple (and self-explanatory) steps:
In addition to a challenge, you can also try to create 
 content (live coaching, live transformations, quizzes, and assessments), consider using HARO (help a reporter out) or even self-publish your own book.
Neither is difficult, and they all get you a ton of authority points!
Marketability: Marketing Your Expertise and Building a Marketing Campaign
“Marketing doesn’t have to be about blowing your own trumpet,” writes Meera Kothand. 
And then she goes on: “There are several subtle ways that you can market yourself and build your credibility as an expert. Because being seen as an expert is as much about your social proof and visibility as it is about the depth of knowledge you have.”
Kothand offers many of them and, really you should have a look at them all – by her own admission, they are based on the principles that Robert Cialdini develops and analyzes in his ultra-popular book 
If you don’t remember them, these are reciprocity, commitment & consistency, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity.
If you want to develop an “expert online business” marketing strategy based on these principles, then you should:
• 
 and tell Google how you want to be seen; yes, we’re talking about meta-titles and meta-data, professional e-mail addresses and branded social presence;
•
by doing away with stock images and cliched “what’s my mission” statements; 
• 
 by offering a free lead magnet (or opt-in incentive) that’s related to your expertise and business model
• 
or FOMO with social proof: be sure to make known the number of your followers in a banner; because 50 million Elvis fans can’t be wrong, can they?
• 
 by showing authority markers or “as seen in” logos; and, finally
• 
by asking your customers to execute some tiny, effortless actions.

Create Valuable Content and Conquer the Middle of the Marketing Funnel Like a Boss
Many people head straight to the bottom of the funnel, aka selling stuff to customers so they can monetize their hobby.
However, the point is to build a large audience first, because it’s much easier to turn engaged subscribers (level 4 of the funnel) into customers and brand advocates (level 5) than it is to convert strangers (level 1) to casual readers and interested subscribers (level 2 and 3).
And the way you do this?
Why, of course: by creating valuable, differentiated content.
The tips & tricks are above.
If It’s More Difficult to Build Authority – Borrow Some
You can build authority by creating challenges and interactive content, but due to the sheer number of experts in any niche, this is far more difficult (no matter how knowledgeable you are) than simply borrowing authority.
Yes, we’re talking about guest posts!
Once again, all you need is valuable content – tailored to your host’s interests and audience.

When it comes to creating a successful business, everyone has a part to play. Are you an employee? What’s your level of engagement? Do you believe in the company’s mission? Are you leading a team or even an organization? What are you? A leader or a boss? Simon Sinek’s 
 explains why the values of a company’s leader can make or break it.
Simon Sinek is one of those authors who seek to unravel the reason why some people love their job whereas others don’t. And he believes it’s all thanks to the leader.

It goes without saying that the leader is essential within a company. And if that leader starts paying attention to his employees and treats them as people, not as mere subordinates, they’ll start to trust each other.

. Once a leader’s gained their trust and created a safe environment where everyone feels like they belong, he guarantees his success as a leader and the high performance of the unit he runs – be it a company, or a sports team.

Any leader that takes into account these leadership lessons and creates a Circle of Safety within the company will be successful.
All these lessons from

What will make you stand out from typical executives? Becoming an effective one.

Leader. Boss. Manager. You’ll find plenty of books focused on these topics, complete with “how to do this” instructions.

EFFECTIVENESS / THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE
Effectiveness is a not tricky business, as Peter Drucker explains it doesn’t require anything special from you, all you need is dedication and willingness to last.

Executives are people with authority.
Therefore they are under constant pressure, so learning effectiveness is a mandatory process for them.
If you want to count yourself among those 
 executives you should learn: how to perceive strengths and weakness, find true values and judge personalities.
“The Effective Executive” teaches you to focus on the outcome. We endorse Peter’s theory that your energy is the 
. Adjust your efforts and energy to results rather than focusing on improving productivity.
Contribution, however, has the capacity to prompt a shift in attention which will drive the executive away from his area of specialty.
By considering this fact, an effective manager ought to narrow its skills, focus on one department at a time, and evaluate the organizational performance – as a whole.
Don’t fly around with your mind meaninglessly, transform your mindset and produce the best possible results.
No leader, no boss, no manager can do a great job without having effective executives around them, or even being this kind of executive themselves.

Discipline Equals Freedom PDF Summary,https://blog.12min.com/discipline-equals-freedom-pdf-summary/,https://blog.12min.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image1-1-1-899x1024.jpg,"9 min read ⌚ 
Discipline is a set of rules, right?
And yet, if you ask former Navy SEAL commandeer Jocko Willink,
Who Should Read “Discipline Equals Freedom”? And Why?
If you’ve already read the two leadership classics, 
and 
– both co-authored by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin – you may think that you already know what to expect from 
.
Yet, as we explain below, this book is a bit different; it lacks the usual fair share of war stories and anecdotes, and the structural integrity of the other two books.
With that being said, it’s much more motivational and inspirational, much more personal and jam-packed with vigor and get-out-of-your-chair energy.
You’ll probably like it if you’re interested in either of these two book categories.
About Jocko Willink
 is a retired United States Navy SEAl commander, a bestselling author on leadership, and a renowned podcaster.
In addition to commandeering the most decorated SEAL unit during the Iraq War (SEAL Team Three’s Task Unit Bruiser), Willink is also a graduate from the University of San Diego with a BA in English.
With fellow former SEAL Leif Babin, he has authored two incredibly popular books on leadership, 
and 
.
In addition, he has also authored four books on his own; 
is one of them.
He is also the host of a popular podcast, the 
.
“Discipline Equals Freedom PDF Summary”
When compared to the other two works by Jocko Willink we’ve summarized here (
and 
),
is rather unusual in at least a few ways:
• Jocko Willink is the sole author, aka it’s not co-written with Leif Babin;
• It has unusual dimensions for a self-help book (7.7 x 1 x 8.8 inches) and a pretty much distinctive military-feel design;
• It’s filled with images of Jocko and stuff, and everything’s even more intimidating and motivating than you’d expect it to be because the entire book is in black and white;
• It’s not as tightly structured as 
 and 
.
More specifically, 
is actually divided into two parts – “Thoughts” and “Actions” – with the latter part subdivided into three sections: “Fuel: Feeding the Machine,” “Repair and Maintenance: Injury Prevention and Recovery,” and “Appendix: The Workouts.”
Furthermore – and as already suggested – the lessons come in distinctive tiny dosages, bursting with energy via short, powerful sentences and bolded, all-capped crescendos scattered all around the page.
Willink covers many topics throughout the book, mostly from a theoretical standpoint in its first part (topics here include discipline, fear, procrastination, weakness, regret, etc.) and in a much more practical manner in the second part (diet, sleep, working out, etc.).
Since even listing all of the lessons inside would take us too much space, for our summary, we decided to select and digest only the best bits of the book.
And since the second part is much more practical (it even includes “the workouts”), we’ve relied almost exclusively on the first one.
Key Lessons from “Discipline Equals Freedom”
1.      The Way of Discipline
2.      Where Does Discipline Come From?
3.      Overcoming Procrastination: When and Where to Start?
4.      Staying Motivated.      
5.      Sugarcoated Lies
6.      Me Versus Me
7.      Laughter Wins
The Way of Discipline
This is, by far, the most important lesson of the book: there’s nothing without self-control, and the only way is the way of the discipline.
If you’ve come him looking for the shortcut or the hack – Jocko Willink is pretty adamant about this – you will never find it.
Why?
Well, because:
Willink describes discipline as “the root of all good qualities,” “the driver of daily execution” and “the core principle that overcomes laziness and lethargy and excuses.”
It’s pretty simple when you think about it!
Want to become a good guitarist? You need to have the discipline to practice. 
Want to become a great footballer? Once again, unless you’re in a cartoon, you won’t achieve that through some magical transformation, but 
.
Want to earn some money and become rich? You need 
; as a rule of thumb, if someone’s selling you shortcuts, he’s 100% lying to you.
Where Does Discipline Come From?
According to Jocko Willink, the question from the title has a pretty simple answer: “Discipline comes from within. Discipline is an internal force.”
What about 
 and self-help gurus and drill instructors, you say?
Sure, they can help you, notes Willink. But unless they are there with you all the time under all circumstances, it will be only a temporary solution.
External discipline is neither as strong nor as permanent as self-discipline.
And self-discipline, as the term itself implies, comes from you, comes from the Self.
More specifically, it comes from your decision to make a mark on the world, to do more, to 
more.
Self-discipline lurks behind every single one of your choices, be they as banal as should you eat this apple or this chocolate bar.
If you repeatedly choose the latter, then blame nobody for your failures: you are not disciplined enough.
Overcoming Procrastination: When and Where to Start?
Unless you’re a superhero, you know exactly how procrastination work: instead of preparing for your math exam tomorrow, here you are, reading a summary of a book you didn’t know if it existed until yesterday.
And this is not just a one-off event: it’s something that keeps happening to you over and over again.
So, how do you stop it? When is the best time to stop procrastinating?
Here and Now, says Jocko Willink.
Simply put, that’s the reality of it all: books don’t get written by themselves; ideas don’t get executed through some miraculous force in the universe; and weights aren’t going to move a single inch unless you try lifting them.
It’s not that complicated, so, really, there’s no need for you to go on researching or debating the pros and cons of it.
Just start doing this.
Take the first step and make things happen.
Here and Now.
Staying Motivated
Motivation is a powerful force. 
So powerful, in fact, that sometimes it can help you move mountains.
Emphasis on 
.
It’s a myth that motivation is a spark; 
; and is the pretty legitimate child of discipline, progress, and success.
Don’t believe us?
Believe Jocko Willink!
He’s a Navy SEAL who has spent years of his life fighting to survive (literally), and yet he says that you can’t “expect to be motivated every day to get out there and make things happen.” 
The reality is that you won’t be. 
So, once again, it’s wrong to count on motivation to achieve something.
You need to count on Discipline.
There are no magic pills or life hacks known to men that will ever do the job for you; you have to do the work yourself; you are the one who has to make it happen.
Sugarcoated Lies
Donuts are tempting.
God-I’d-give-everything-for-one-at-this-moment tempting.
The colorful sprinkles, the cream filling, the glaze… 
We know what you must be thinking at the moment: why are you doing this to me, man? I need to get a donut right away!
Why shouldn’t you?
It’s just one treat for the day, and, dare we say, its highlight! And, moreover, you’re hungry. And when you’re hungry, any food is better than no food, right?
Wrong. Dead wrong.
First of all, donuts – just like chocolate chip cookies, double Dutch chocolate cake, Coca Cola, potato chips, pretzels, hot dogs – are, simply put, 
food!
They are, quite literally, 
.
They don’t make you better, stronger, faster, healthier, smarter – they make you the very opposite of this.
Even when you’re hungry.
And, believe us, you’ve never been hungry; human beings can survive for a month without food, and you’ve barely gone without it for more than 10 hours.
Donuts are enticing because they are sugarcoated lies.
There will be many other sugarcoated lies you’ll happen upon throughout your life, both literal, and, much more importantly, metaphorical.
Stay. Away. From. Them.
If they are shiny, sweet, tempting, and, especially, if they are free – then they are most probably lies, poisonous lies!
Don’t let them fool you.
Just stay on your course: your will is much stronger than the will of a donut.
Hold the line.
Me Versus Me
“There are people in the world who have skills and strength and talent that I will never have. Never.”
For example, he says, no matter how much he trains and how hard he works, he will never be an Olympic weightlifter or an Olympic sprinter.
And this comes from a guy who’s a decorated Navy SEAL commander and who has probably trained every single day of his adult life for at least a few hours!
Now, why’s that?
Because he doesn’t have “the right genes.” 
.
But where does that leave us, we who are tenth the people Jocko Willink is?
Well, in his opinion, precisely where he was a few decades ago: resolute to try to become what his genes say that he will never be.
Because, in the end, that amounts to becoming the best that he can be.
“My glory,” notes Willink in few sentences which are more than worthy of a quote: 
You always win today if you’re better than you were yesterday.
And that’s guaranteed.
Laughter Wins
“Sure, there’s darkness everywhere,” notes Jocko Willink in his last “thought.” “And I have seen my share.”
Remember (once again): this is a guy who has not only fought but commandeered during the bloodiest battle of the Iraq War, a man who has seen other people – his friends and soldiers – die at his feet.
In other words, he has seen so much more darkness than you will ever see. 
Even so, he really thinks that despairing over it all is the wrong way to go.
No matter how difficult life is, it is less so when you’re laughing at it.

“Discipline Equals Freedom Quotes”
Our Critical Review
is not much different from 
; in some ways, it could even remind one of Tony Robbins.
However, make no mistakes: this book’s a bit different than all those “you can achieve everything you want to” manuals.
Because it starts where all self-help books should start from: the “no shortcuts” reality of life. 
It offers no secrets, no hacks, no tricks.
Just a bunch of sensible, commonsense, practical pieces of advice you can’t go wrong with."

This is a book about SEO.

Hundreds of strategies rising and falling. A noisy world where everybody talks about everything that matters for SEO.
If you are a practitioner of SEO, you may say “A book about SEO? This is such a waste of time. To be up to date this book should be written …tomorrow!” And you aren’t far from the truth.

Usually when I read about “content”, I find plenty of standard phrases to describe it as: “good content’, “unique content”, “a content that stands out”….

Outwitting the Devil PDF Summary,https://blog.12min.com/outwitting-the-devil-pdf-summary/,https://blog.12min.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image1-3.jpg,"7 min read ⌚ 
Not too many people have the wits to puzzle over their relationship with the infinite Source. 
In the same category, we can put those who can’t seem to spot the difference between good and bad thoughts.
Society is compelled into adopting this negative mindset, which is fueled by the Devil.
We cast positive features aside, labeling them as silly.
Let’s see how to break the spell.
Who Should Read “Outwitting the Devil”? And Why?
The concept of a mystical dark force is often misunderstood. 
Napoleon Hill dismantles many assumptions and depicts the Devil as the negative voice in our heads. 
With this in mind, it’s crystal clear as to why we find “
” to be a good fit for the broader audience. 
Society, in general, suffers from this evil force, and it’s time to put an end to the delusions.
About Napoleon Hill
 is probably the founding father of the self-help genre. Some might argue otherwise, but we wholeheartedly believe that he perfected the philosophy.
In his books, he elaborates on the path one must cross in order to come out a winner.
Born in the late 19
 century, he was struck by a series of unwanted events.
During that time, Napoleon conducted the largest success study ever undertaken by someone. Most of its findings are incorporated into his bestselling books:
“Outwitting the Devil PDF Summary”
Napoleon Hill is renowned for his endeavors in the pursuit of truth and finding the formula for success.
In 1908, he met Andrew Carnegie (one of the world’s wealthiest people throughout history) and expressed a desire to enroll in Law School.
Mr. Carnegie was surprised to hear that Hill planned to get his degree by interviewing successful people and writing their stories in magazines.
Mr. Carnegie pointed out that if he wants to be of service to all people, and posterity as well, he must also underline the causes for failure.
The world is in need of a practical and philosophical explanation of achievement and loss.
If you are eager to undertake this job, you must interview not only those who succeeded but also those who have failed.
A real wake-up call for young Napoleon.
In the following years, Napoleon managed to interview approximately 25,000 people (perceived as failures), and around 500 (successes).
During that time, he also became aware of the concept of an emergency.
Mr. Carnegie taught him that somewhere along the path, he’d get a glimpse on how people’s habits change in case of crisis or tension.
And that was the missing link in his research.
It all was predicated on the fact that any emergency will lead to an opportunity. It’s safe to say that at the end of the research Napoleon had his Eureka moment.
You can call this the “Other Self” but bear in mind that it cannot do the work on your behalf. It can only guide you through the stream of thoughts and help you to understand the natural impulses of nature.
The faith yet again rests on your shoulders.
Do you know that the darkest hour is just before the dawn? – Don’t give up, even when things get unbearably difficult.
It came clear to Napoleon that finding and understanding the “Other Self” can alleviate us from all the pain and suffering. 
Everything you need will come to you; it seemed that way for Napoleon Hill.
It all boils down to the reality that the whole world is driven by fear, cultural limitations, and meaningless education. 
Doubt and negligence are at the core of our decision-making, and we don’t seem to care.
If you don’t conform to this law, and If you disregard the notion of the “Other Self” you’ll be left in blindness. It’s impossible to galvanize a person into action, who espouses beliefs that are limiting human creativity. 
The state of one’s mind, known as faith, circumvents the restrictive nature of the five physical senses and communicates with the infinite source of power. This book gives us a run-through of the whole process, and how the Devil exerts influence over you.
During the interview with the Devil, you’ll be dragged into an inner discussion. Knowing how to outmaneuver this skillful opponent is going to be decisive. In the meantime, you’ll catch a glimpse of the Devil’s nature, and its bag of tricks.
Are you ready for the interview Mr. Devil?
 Yes, but only if you address me as “Your Majesty”?
 Why on Earth would I do that?
 Because I control 98% of the world, and there’s nothing you can do! I am the majority, that’s why.
: Alright! Let’s begin. Where do you live?
I am not bounded to any form, and have no physical appearance. I accumulate all of the negative energy consisting of fears, beliefs, and limitations.
Above all else, I occupy ½ of every atom.
: You are saying that without your influence, there would be no world, changes, emotions, stars?
Exactly! 
:
I’ve been led to understand that you occupy only half of everything. To whom does the second half belong to?
My enemy or the opposition should you prefer.
: Your Majesty, could you tell us a little bit more about the process of controlling 98% of the earthbound creatures?
 It all started thousands of years ago when people began to think. I plant my seeds of fear in the minds of people and force them to perceive these sensations as if they are their own creation. Someone might call it a deft maneuver, but it’s simply a good strategy to maintain control.
: Time and space are completely irrelevant, is that correct?
 By all means! I choose the place of battle, and because of my abstract nature, I cannot be wiped out, not in a million years.
: What about your opponent, isn’t he a threat to your existence?
 Well, not quite, since the opposition controls the positive forces which society deems unrealistic. You see, I don’t want to control the Universe, just my human slaves, by pulling the strings.
: Who is your greatest adversary on Earth?
 Those who inspire earthbound creatures to think outside the box. I can even name a few: Socrates, Emerson, Thomas Paine, and Abraham Lincoln.
: Do you have another thing to add, Your Majesty?
 Cigarettes are also a tool that helps me to hold society in a stranglehold and keep it there permanently.
: Your Majesty, you are the worst thing that has ever descended upon the Earth. However, I am keen to know, are you are willing to cut those people loose? 
Give up on your power? 
 In that regard, I am helpless, and it’s not up to me! It’s the minds of my prisoners which have to reject me, not vice versa.
Here are the seven principles you need to adhere to in order to attain spiritual, financial and emotional maturity:
Don’t get too analytical over these principles.
If you digest their essential message, you wouldn’t be compelled to memorize them. Above all else, you must not roam around aimlessly!
Only then, you’ll be able to think about environmental, and sociological hurdles that may hamper your progress.
: What one has to do in order to find its life purpose?
 One must strive hard not to lose control over itself. But I can say with some confidence that most people succumbed to the negative pressure, and took a psychological beating. 
: So, how can one be in a position to regain power? What is required of him/her to do?
 Let’s start with the most basic ones:
Three appetites are impeding your progress:
: So what can we do about them, is there an antidote to this chaos?
 I would say that there’s no greater enemy than yourself. Even I have no power over those who clearly understand the power of positive thought.
: Does the youth possess the wisdom to resist you?
 Mostly not, because insights come from experience, and experience comes from time. So, you have to cling onto something, other than fear in order to overpower the negative force.
Key Lessons from “Outwitting the Devil”
1.      Pull yourself together
2.      Discern the difference between Truth and Reality 
3.      Say “No” to the Devil
Pull yourself together
It goes with saying that you must maintain your composure even in times of stress and trouble.
That doesn’t imply that you should accept defeat, merely to learn lessons out of it. And to be able to that, one must be geared up with the right mindset.
Discern the difference between Truth and Reality
You don’t need anyone telling you that people have this natural inclination to put these two in the same league.
However, you should be aware of the fact that “Reality” is self-created; it’s not a Universal fact. 
So, whatever your reality might be, that’s not the Truth, it’s only the “Devil” leading you astray.
Say “No” to the Devil
The symbolic meaning of the “No” is composed of courage and vigilance.
In the beginning, it might be hard to recognize the negative effects of overthinking, but as time goes by, you’ll get better and better in staying alert.

Antifragile PDF Summary,https://blog.12min.com/antifragile-pdf-nassim-nicholas-taleb/,,"17 min read ⌚ 
What does Antifragile mean? Try to connect this concept with an immunity on predicting errors and with the strongest pattern for living our lives.
The “Antifragile Summary” contains all the elements you need to understand the terminology.
Constantly preoccupied with problems of uncertainty, probability, and knowledge, the bestselling author 
 reveals wise ways how to thrive in an uncertain world.
Check the nuggets below (visual quotes from books) to have a quite great visual and textual preview of what Antifragile means from Nassim Nicholas Taleb ‘s perspective.
Who Should Read “Antifragile? And Why?
Don’t be afraid to be that person who thrives on myriad challenges. This book expands your views and gives you something new to hold on to.
As a book of today, that reveals the troubles of yesterday, we believe that any person would find it interesting, inspiring and ultimately entertaining.
About Nassim Nicholas Taleb
 is a renowned personality and an amazing writer.
Despite being the author of several highly inspirational books like 
, 
 and 
he also works at New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering as a professor of risk engineering.
He was born in 1960 in Lebanon, and from an early age, Taleb had interest in various activities that weren’t typical for a 10-year-old boy.
Nevertheless, he later turned to be a genius and mastered the artistry of randomness, possibility, uncertainty.
“Antifragile PDF Summary”
It seems like Nassim Nicholas Taleb continues to impress with his ideas.
This fantastic book serves as a reminder that we are becoming too “Fragile.” If you not convinced about the meaning let’s share a thing or two.
The greatest strength is to avoid being at the mercy of other people, events or circumstances.
In fact, the core idea that motivated Taleb to create this idiosyncratic, and insightful book is briefly explained as well.
The revolution starts from within, bear hardship, and keep going – you are the next generations of “Antifragiles.” We assume that each of you has at least some basic understanding of what it means to be fragile.
Let’s expand on this theory:
Fragility is a threat to us all, mostly referring to things related to the global economy and market. Although the actual meaning of “Antifragile” denotes something durable, or unbreakable thing, Nassim mainly refers to flexibility.
The creation of this term indicates that it’s possible to surmount any obstacle despite all the 
 twists, disruptions that may occur down the road.
From a practical point of view, the author advocates for a system that can cope with various types of crisis. Just by scanning Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s prologue – you can get an aerial view of the effects of Fragility.
The process of identifying all fragile elements can last forever, so let’s take a short break to figure out what to do next.
In this case, it’s best if you stay away from false claims and accusations. For instance, he dismantles the need for micromanagement and transparently describes what it means to undergo an antifragile reform.
Antifragile gives importance and priority to ethics, meanwhile underlying the stories of many heroes who risked everything for other people’s sake.
What about society?
Taleb implies that 
 should revamp their structure, and apply a new model that is proven to be morally superior to others.
According to him, the modern world is the “legitimate successor” of two major illusions: intervention and prediction. Both systems are tilted toward domination and control over the people. Mostly using superstitiousness.
To get this point even further, Taleb in “Antifragile” gives birth to various conceptual examples, which reveal some of the hypocrisy in the economy, medicine, and politics.
Even if it’s hard for you to follow the voice of reason, the facts will surely convince you otherwise.
Not only that this classic expose false ideologies and dangerous ideas, but in return, it offers allegiance to
 – you never had.
Key Lessons from “Antifragile”
1.      The basic laws

2.      Understand the strong bond

3.      Faith in history
The basic laws
Taleb once again shows his immense expertise by explaining some fundamental principles that must be enforced 
.
He “picks up a fight” with individuals who believe that formal education emerged as any other practical thing.
He highly admires the American society for their risk-taking mentality and discredits other risk-aversive cultures.
Understand the strong bond
To fully understand the impact of antifragility, one must be clear about its meaning and the link it has with modernity.
According to Taleb, modernity is best explained as a model that contributes to fragility, by attempting to control everything.
According to this classic, in order to oppose this method Taleb, presents a fictional character who instead of taking failures too personal, it perceives them as data.
Faith in history
Taleb embraces some traditional concepts, and always seeks a way, that will grant him “safe-return” to central ideas, and tested methods.
However, don’t let this fool you because, on the other hand, he will always be the one – who fiercely promotes risk!!
“Antifragile” Quotes
Our Critical Review
This book definitely enters into the “masterpiece” category. In our opinion, you’ll immediately sense the tension arising from it, and relief in the end.
In an antifragile world, uncertainty becomes necessary, for only that which is antifragile can grow and develop. Antifragile is the instruction manual for living in a world full of possibilities, and this microbook will introduce you to its key concepts.
Fragility is a simple concept. We know that porcelain or a set of crystal bowls are fragile items that require special care.
If they are not handled with care, they will inevitably break, and therefore we must know how to deal with this fragility, to be ready for unforeseen events.
It is necessary to pack them well for transport, to ensure that in case of unexpected occurrence, they do not break.
But when we try to talk about the opposite of fragility, we have great difficulty. How should we call that which is not fragile? Many would say that the opposite of fragility is robustness.
But robustness is not the opposite of weak.
A sturdy item may not even break when an accident occurs, but it does not benefit from this situation.
If the fragile needs a package that says “Handle with care,” the item we are looking for is a piece that the less care it receives when handled, the stronger it becomes.
Apparently, no word defines this situation, items that benefit from the unexpected. Taleb wed the coined that will guide our narrative: the Antifragile, which is the antithesis of the fragile.
His example to describe what antifragility is the  Lernaean Hydra, a figure of Greek mythology. The Hydra was a multi-headed serpent that terrified the Greeks and was known to be indestructible.
Each time someone cut one of the heads, two others grew in that place. The more the Hydra was attacked, the stronger it became.
She was the definition of the antifragile.
An example of antifragility is the process of evolution of living things.
Think of the evolutionary theory of Charles Darwin, about how creatures change and adapt. Evolution only happens in a fickle and hostile environment.
Whenever a difficulty occurs, evolution forces life to adjust so that it fits well into the new environment.
However, there is an interesting aspect of this concept: while the process itself is antifragile, the individuals who participate in it are fragile.
Evolution happens when genetic code is passed and generates changes known as mutations.
As the changes persist, the individuals who have helped in this change suffer over time. The death of these members is necessary to make room for evolution.
One of the rules of antifragility is precisely this: for a system to be antifragile, most of its parts must be fragile.
It’s because parts of an antifragile system work with information that feeds you through your successes or failures, showing what works and what’s not okay.
Failures, therefore, are a crucial part of the process, which works in a trial-and-error method.
With every mistake made by the individuals involved, the system strengthens because it learns new things and becomes better.
 is also an antifragile system. The constituent parts, such as people and companies, are somehow fragile, but the economy itself is the opposite.
For it to grow, some of these parts must fail, because we must learn from the mistakes made by its elements.
When a company ends up failing, it teaches the other parts of the economic system some lessons about how not to die in this environment.
The antifragility is part of our day to day and is present at all times.
When we do physical exercises, for example, we are experiencing antifragility because we are exposing our body to abnormal forces, so that it strengthens and grows our muscles.
In one exercise, muscles are confronted by stressful forces, such as weights.
This power makes our antifragile system respond with overcompensation, improving our ability to deal with stresses that in theory would cause fragility.
Strength comes from overcompensation in times of adversity, and it leaves anti-fragile systems with elements of excess power built in response to stressors.
In theory, we waste strength in exercising, and common sense tells us that success depends on the efficient use of our resources, not waste.
On the other hand, overcompensation and redundancy are vital to antifragility, as they prepare us for unknown and uncertain problems.
The exercise that seemed like a waste of time actually can save us from an emergency where we need to run or jump.
This redundancy, in fact, leaves us better able to cope and survive in adverse and unexpected situations.
Consistency and predictability end up creating fragile systems. While antifragility is found in natural and biological systems, fragile systems are often artificial.
Therefore, most things created by man should not be antifragile, because they cannot improve through mistakes and the unexpected.
A human-made system may even be robust, but it is rarely anti-fragile. Think, for example, of a car.
The car can run thousands of miles and last for dozens of years but its use, over time, will make it weaker and worn, until the moment it succumbs.
However, although uncommon, there are artificial antifragile systems.
The economy, for example, has an almost biological structure and is so complex that it has become antifragile. But complexity alone does not make a system antifragile.
To be anti-fragile, it also needs inconsistency. Inconsistencies are shocks and stressors that define which units should die to strengthen the system.
In a predictable and calm system, there are no stressors and also no pressure on the units of the system.
With this, the antifragility of the scheme gradually disappears. Therefore, trying to control the antifragile tends only to weaken it.
In most cases where a government tries to tame the economy through interventions and regulations, for example, the weakens the economy.
When a government tries to make its economy more predictable, it removes stressors, and this eventually weakens the system.
Tranquility removes the information that is learned by inconsistency, through trial and error, which weakens the system as a whole.
Our society overestimates theoretical and academic knowledge and tends to underestimate practical knowledge.
We tend to believe that theoretical knowledge will lead us to practical knowledge, but this is rare.
Think of it this way: if you know how to design a rocket, you probably do not know how to be an astronaut.
Nassim Taleb has extensive experience in international capital markets. He realized these markets were extremely inconsistent and that the most successful investors had the least formal education.
Although they did not understand much about economic theory or knew the countries in which they invested, they knew the right time to put invest their money.
It is therefore important to know that it is entirely possible to benefit from an anti-fraud system without understanding its theoretical principles.
To do this, you need to have options and choices in this system, such as options to buy and sell stocks from stock exchanges.
If the system brings you opportunities, but with no obligation on your side, you have the optionality. You may choose to buy or sell, but you can also simply do nothing.
It is possible to be an investor without knowing in theory how market fluctuations work, as long as you have the practical knowledge to know at what time you should exercise your options and thus take advantage of the opportunities.
The optionality exists in all systems. You use your options in all your day-to-day decisions, and they only fit you.
You can go to a party by car, on foot or by subway. You may even just not go. These choices are yours, and no one can force you to choose an option.
Periods of inconsistency and uncertainty are inevitable. We go through periods of crisis in our personal, professional lives, face economic crises and come across unpredictable accidents.
One must understand the variable and accept it to become an antifragile person.
To become antifragile, there is no need to avoid uncertainties. It is necessary to know what extreme situations can happen and prepare for it.
The first way to prepare yourself is by focusing on the ‘negative element’ that can occur. Knowing what the negative part is, you can reduce your risks.
For example, if you want to protect yourself from the economy’s inconsistencies, you should prepare and make sure that most of your assets are safe and will not suffer from market volatility.
Taleb recommends that you put 90% of your assets into investments of 
.
By doing so, you may end up making less money on riskier investments, but on the other hand, you guarantee your financial stability.
Once you protect yourself against adverse contingencies, you should focus on the other side: the positive element.
If you have saved 90% of your assets to avoid exposing yourself to potential fluctuations in the economy, you can now use the remaining 10% in the best possible way.
With this 10 %, you can take risks, because even if things go wrong, you are putting at stake only those 10%, which will not affect you permanently.
This approach protects your equity, but it also gives you the chance to capitalize on a scenario where a positive element occurs and brings you significant gains.
An example of a poor allocation of resources would be, for instance, if you put 100% of your assets into a medium-risk investment.
You do not protect yourself and expose yourself to positive and negative elements at the same time. Doing so means putting the future of your money in a condition of extreme risk and uncertainty.
If you do not have options, you are surrounded. Imagine that you have to make a hotel reservation in a city on a date where the flow of tourists is very high.
You look at all the hotels, and you can not find a room. When you find the last place of the city, the price is very high.
Unfortunately, you can not do anything, just pay for that reservation. Bad, isn’t it?
When you are surrounded, you have only one option and have to follow it regardless of the cost to you.
And the cost of not having options will be determined by the size of the pressure: the higher the pressure, the harder it will be to deal with it.
In case of the hotel, for example, the costs may be high for the person who is reserving the room, but they would be worse if she had decided to take the whole family on this trip.
The more complex the situation, the more expensive it becomes to get out of it.
With the world economy increasingly connected because of globalization, the world is increasingly exposed to pressures of colossal dimensions.
In economics, for example, if a large company is left with no options to survive, a domino effect occurs.
Your suppliers, employees, and customers are affected, and as they are affected, other businesses and people continue to be impacted.
Any major economic problem nowadays is global and universal, and its consequences reverberate at high speed.
The great financial crisis of 2008 left significant scars on the contemporary economy.
These professionals were completely wrong, and the crisis cost the world economy billions of dollars.
Even after a wrong and disastrous prediction, many of these ‘experts’ 
, without having to apologize for the mistake made in the 2008 crisis.
That is because, in areas such as this, professionals know each other, coexist and depend on each other, so there are great fear and care in making any more incisive criticism to a fellow professional.
Although their analyses and predictions about the crisis have been completely wrong and have negatively impacted the lives of millions of people, the mistakes of these professionals are quickly forgotten.
This type of situation exemplifies a serious problem in modern society: many people’s antifragility exists because others are suffering damage.
In the case of these specialists, these people gain prestige when they are right, but they do not suffer consequences when they are wrong.
The analyst on Wall Street and the other financial markets has become an anti-fraud professional because he is not taking risks with his attitudes, but with those of other people.
It happens in a similar way to bankers.
In the medieval era, bankers who talked and lost money from their clients were decapitated. That made all managers think of the common good and not just their gains.
Today, however, modern bankers 
, after all, if they risk right, they make a lot of money for themselves, and if they fail, they have nothing to lose.
Other people’s money is at stake and optionality is given to them.
The way we think about our society has a fundamental problem.
We believe that we need to make our community as quiet and consistent as possible. As people become smarter, they also become more arrogant and want more control over the world.
Because inconsistency is something we can not predict, we try to avoid it and reduce it, to have control over the world.
Politicians and economists tend to think that our economic cycle of ups and downs is inefficient and unpredictable, and they work trying to understand how to control it so that it improves and evolves.
They develop complex economic theories that point out the times when there must be intervention in economic cycles so that we can be able to predict better.
However, this policy of acting “correctively” in a system is called naive interventionism.
Unfortunately, we do not know as much as we think we are aware and this means that, instead of improving our systems, we end up making them more fragile, without realizing it.
By trying to make these systems more predictable, we are stealing the volatility they need to survive and evolve.
Without the inconsistency, there is no antifragility, and the problems are no longer visible, hiding under a false tranquility.
Then, unknowingly, these problems reach gigantic proportions that are much harder to deal with.
An interesting example would be to think of a forest. Every forest is in danger of being burned down.
However, the risk of a massive fire is reduced every time a small fire occurs. Small fires periodically remove flammable materials from the forest without reaching a significant number of trees.
The smaller fire is an example of volatility, a feature that helps prevent significant problems. As we avoid volatility, we are getting more prone to devastating fires.
Our society has the bad habit of making predictions based on a narrow and small view of the past.
It makes those who follow the forecasts may be at risk of consequences when the expected events do not happen.
Another shortcoming is to believe that the worst thing we have ever witnessed is the worst thing that can happen.
The fact that there was a terrorist attack on September 11 that destroyed two towers in New York does not mean that something of much greater proportions cannot occur in the future.
Believing in our ability to predict the future leads us to have emergency plans for limited adverse situations and does not allow us to think about all the bad things that can happen.
Emergencies can be unpredictable and unlikely, and we have to rely on the worst-case scenario to predict.
An interesting example comes from engineering. The Fukushima nuclear power plant, for instance, was built to withstand the largest earthquake ever seen in the world.
However, its creators were not aware that a larger earthquake than the past could happen in the future.
In 2011, even though the plant was built for past earthquakes, a major earthquake destroyed the plant’s reactor.
We tend to believe that the Industrial Revolution was one caused by scientific progress.
That’s what they teach in schools, is not it? Most think that theoretical advances have guided the technological advances that transform the way society produces products and thus the economy.
But this is not true. When the Industrial Revolution occurred, it was not led by academics but by individuals without formal education.
The submarine, for example, was invented by a pastor and not by a university or a naval institution.
Other important inventions also came as the results of people who worked independently.
They came from people who were experimenting with 
It was this dynamic of trial and error that guaranteed that the Industrial Revolution occurred, forming an anti-fragile system.
Today our society does not understand the importance of antifragility and the official narrative of Industrial Revolution is proof of this.
We do not like to imagine that our progress may have come through a system of trial and error, and we prefer to believe in more deterministic reasons for having advanced as a society.
Our society wants our experts to know exactly what they are doing and not for them to try and find out what works.
It has significant effects on modern society. For example, several scientists end up getting resources for their research promising breakthrough discoveries from academia.
These researchers receive money from governments and private initiative to create new theories and discoveries that will make our lives easier.
Unfortunately, what is not clear to all is that it is possible to achieve all the promised progress through just these theories: randomness and antifragility from chaos are necessary for the emergence of real changes and innovations.

Business Secrets of the Trappist Monks PDF Summary,https://blog.12min.com/business-secrets-of-the-trappist-monks-pdf/,,"6 min read ⌚ 
There’s a lot to be learned from the simple, selfless lives of Trappist monks, as August Turak discovered. His book is a journey to becoming a better person, a better employee, a better leader.
It’s about becoming successful by focusing on everything but success and transforming your life (and the lives of those around you) along the way.
Reading this book feels like reading Siddhartha (although a closer match would be a Coelho book rather than Hesse), more specifically the part where Siddhartha – a man who renounced every worldly possession – tries and succeeds at being a prosperous merchant by using a spiritual approach for both his business model and for gaining the proper lessons out the experience.
Compared to other business books
 
feels more like literature than business manual.
ENLIGHTENING / BUSINESS SECRETS OF THE TRAPPIST MONKS
“Business Secrets of the Trappist Monks PDF Summary”
We’re first presented with the peaceful surroundings of the Mepkin Abbey that our main character, the middle-aged August Turak, one day enters to seek spiritual guidance.
The Abbey is home to Trappist monks, a Benedictine order whose values range from pity and selflessness to prayer and work.
Here we learn, from the very first pages, the superpowers that human beings can achieve just from being selfless.
Learning French in a few months just to help someone with an essay, for example, is just one the many consequences of a life devoted to the high quality of work that these monks commit to.
That kind of approach is the result of wanting to do something greater than the task at hand, to reach beyond making something specific, to transcend in whatever you do to a higher selfless self.
There are, of course, some religious aspects found in this book, but Turak doesn’t seem to be very concerned about this part. For him, God is to be 
, no matter if you believe in something or not. Selflessness is part of any human being.
You won’t be taught how to mock selflessness in this book. In order to gain profit from your business, you will not learn how to obtain it, and you will not be enlightened after the last chapter.
Instead
 
 will reveal to you a hard path, a path that goes well beyond its pages, a path where you’ll have to face yourself, time and time again. A path during which self-sacrifice becomes a reflex.
The book’s also – as the name implies – about business. Those secrets of the Trappist monks are just hard work. Business is more than numbers. 
 has a human dimension and that’s far more important than cold business plans.
Humans are naturally attracted towards greater things than themselves and want to be part of something important. All of us, maybe because of our mortality, need to feel that our lives aren’t lived in vain.
Business is just one aspect in which these tendencies manifest themselves, but it’s important because nowadays work takes up most of our day.
People are also attracted to trustworthy people. Trustworthiness is built on time and through hard work. It requires a strong will and a genuine moral code
There are examples of these traits at work throughout Turak’s book.
When a brother in the Mepkin Abbey confessed to Turak that retiring in seclusion was the hardest thing he did, simply because he had to face himself, Turak felt like he could go through hell if his brother asked him to.
The authenticity of this simple admission means more than strong pompous words ever can. It taps into our general need for authentic feelings and authentic life. To put that into your daily life and, as a consequence, your work is bound to have miraculous effects.
Another important aspect that Turak insists on is the importance of self-sacrifice to a mission and a community. He gives parallel examples of this continuous giving, away from the monastic way of life and from the entrepreneur’s point of view.
The purpose of this juxtaposition is for readers to draw their own conclusions about the importance of a higher aim than doing your job, going home, and repeating this without any real progress happening.
This idea’s related to the somewhat new trend to make your job your life. But these two ideas don’t live in the same house.
The main difference is that Turak’s model proposes the opposite of ego-driven, corporate ladder climbing, weekend-working ideal that corporate America seems to worship. It’s actually the opposite.
Sacrifice has many faces. Admitting a weakness in front of a colleague (especially one that you don’t see eye to eye with), not giving up when things get hard and apologizing if you’ve made mistakes are all expressions of selflessness.
In a corporate environment, these selfless acts come as a result of a personal mission to become a selfless individual, as is the case with Turak, or as the result of the company’s mission, its culture, and credo.
Turak gives an example of this from his own company. He and his associates sat down and decided on the rules of the company. They followed those rules, with Turak at the helm, even in the most desperate situations and with the harshest of consequences, to give a life-changing experience to both employees and customers.
All these messages are delivered with the spirit of a man who knows exactly what he wants to transmit, and with the dedication of one who wants to help the reader understand his message.
The contents and lessons of 
 can be also analyzed by paying attention to the care that August Turak took when writing it. The examples he chooses are situations that any of us can relate to.
A particularly inspired parallel Turak draws is with the Hero’s Journey, a study by Joseph Campbell based on the myths, folklore and religions of people all over the world.
The stages of the hero’s journey are similar in all cultures of the world and can be found in many movies and books. We’re given the perspective of viewing the struggles of our own life as stages of the hero’s journey, the hardest one being “the desert”.
This is the part where everything seems to be tedious and going nowhere, and progress is so small and slows it can barely be called that.
This path can be kept with great sacrifice and determination, or it can be left behind for being too hard and not giving anything real in return.
The reward for choosing this hard path of continuous self-monitoring, living for others and giving as a second nature is complex. Glimpses of it are found throughout the book, and they’re of a 
.
They all converge to the fact that we can become better human beings, in touch with our own needs and desires, motivated by the need to just be better at everything we do, focused on the task at hand.

“Business Secrets of Trappist Monks Quotes”
Our Critical Review
Most importantly, they show how to intercept and interpret the present, and how we can make it better for the people around us.
The worldly consequence of this will become less important as this way of life takes control. Money, success, trust, being looked up to, will come naturally.
All we ever desired won’t be a matter of struggle but will appear as if we didn’t even work for it, because we did something far more meaningful."

The small town is that of Ada, Oklahoma.
The murder: that of Debra Sue Carter.
The injustice: of epic proportions.
Ladies and gentlemen, John Grisham’s only non-fiction book to date:
.
Who Should Read “The Innocent Man”? And Why?
There’s a reason why, when someone mentions the phrase “legal thriller,” the first two words that come into the mind of many are: John Grisham.
Translated into more than 50 languages, his books (and there are about 40 of them) have sold about 300 million copies worldwide! Divide that, and you get an average of about 7 million copies per book – a staggering number considering Grisham’s output!
But, then again, not that surprising: it’s Grisham, so the readers know what to expect: murders and all sorts of crimes, convoluted plots, lawyers, courtroom dramas.
– though a non-fiction book – is not an exception; in fact, it’s even 
 than fiction, telling (mainly) the story of Ron Williamson, a former minor league baseball player, wrongly convicted for murder.
In the “Author’s Note,” Grisham himself notes that “not in [his] most creative moment could [he] conjure up a story as rich and as layered as Ron’s.”
And an 
review goes a step further, claiming that, with 
, Grisham “has written both an American tragedy and his strongest legal thriller yet, all the more gripping because it happens to be true.”
In other words, if you are a John Grisham fan, 
is probably even 
 than what you would expect from a Grisham novel; if you are not – this is the book to become one.
There are little things as universally appealing as true crime stories involving innocent people; which is why Netflix decided to adapt the book in 
, the trailer for which you can find below.
If you don’t want any more spoilers – stop reading here.
About John Grisham
 is an American novelist, attorney, and politician, best known as the author of a series of wildly successful legal thrillers.
After graduating from Mississippi State University and receiving a law degree from the University of Mississippi School of Law in 1981, Grisham went on to practice criminal law for a decade.
In 1989, he published his first novel, 
, in a modest 5,000 print run; the book was neither a critical nor a popular success. However, that all changed when two years later Grisham’s second novel, 
, gained him wide popularity.
Both books were later turned into movies: 
in 1993, with Tom Cruise and Gene Hackman in the main roles, and 
in 1996, starring Matthew McConaughey and Samuel L. Jackson.
All of Grisham’s four next novels were both bestsellers and adapted into blockbuster movies almost as soon as released: 
• 
(starring Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington); 
• 
(starring Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones); 
• 
(starring Gene Hackman and Chris O’Donnell); and 
• 
(directed by Francis Ford Coppola and featuring an All-Star cast headed by Matt Damon and Danny DeVito);
Five more of Grisham’s remaining thirty or so novels have been turned into movies as well (
, and
), and three others (
, 
, and 
)
should be in the next two or three years.
John Grisham is one of only three authors to sell two million copies on first printing (Tom Clancy and 
 are the other two).

“The Innocent Man PDF Summary”
Though 
is often described as the story of the murder of Debra Sue Carter and the wrongful conviction of Ron Williamson, there’s a lot more to John Grisham’s book – like the ones who have already binge-watched 
’s docuseries already know. 
True, Ron Williamson’s story is the main narrative, but there are a few subplots as well: the purported murder of Denice Haraway especially, as well as the murder of Kathy Wilholt and the wrongful conviction of his husband, Greg.
The book itself is divided into 17 chapters and jumps between stories, but, for our summary, we decided to separate the main two cases in two sections and recap each of them in few short chapters.
Hopefully, this should help you follow the main arcs better.
The Murder of Debra Sue Carter
Ronald Keith Williamson was a successful school and college baseball player, and when he left high school, he seemed to have the world at his feet. 
However, he soon learned that “no star fades faster than that of a high school athlete.”
First, a shoulder injury hindered his chances to become something in the world of minor league baseball and, then, he slowly began to show signs of mental illness, drifting into a life of alcoholism, petty crimes, and misdemeanor.
On December 8, 1982, the body of Debra Sue Carter, a 21-year-old cocktail waitress, was found in the bedroom of her garage apartment in Ada. Police investigation showed that she had been beaten and raped before being suffocated. 
Williamson – and his “drinking buddy” Dennis Fritz – were regular guests at Coachlight, the restaurant where Debra worked, and, allegedly, the victim had complained about them to a friend sometime before being murdered. 
To make matters worse, a guy named Glen Gore – who had been seen chatting with Ada on the night before the murder – claimed in an interview with the police that he had last seen Debbie with none other than Ron Williamson.
Since he was “a somewhat notorious carouser with a loud mouth,” the police had no problems believing Glen that Williamson might have been pestering Debbie.
The investigation made a few false starts, but, then, suddenly, there was a breakthrough. 
You see, soon after the murder, Williamson was imprisoned for kiting cheques. An inmate of his, Terri Holland – “a career criminal” – told the police that she had heard Ron admitting to the crime while in prison. 
Another informant came forward and stated the same in relation to Dennis Fritz, just one day after the prosecution would have been legally bound to drop the charges against him. 
Williamson made matters even worse for him when he recounted to the police a dream of his, in which he stabbed and strangled the victim.
Why?
Because this was treated as a confession.
Coupled with some shoddy forensic work, this led to Williamson being sent to death row, and Fritz sentenced to life in prison.
Williamson’s death sentence was supposed to be carried out on September 24, 1994 – and six days before that Williamson could be heard shouting “I’m innocent! I’m innocent! I’m innocent!” from his cell.
Fortunately, the next day, a group of appellate lawyers filed a 
petition which saved Williamson’s life.
The document which turned things around began thus:
Williamson was eleven years on death row when DNA evidence exonerated him and Fritz on April 15, 1999, making Ron the 78
 inmate released from death row since 1973.
Four years after the release of Williamson and Fritz, on June 24, 2003, the real murderer was found.
Surprise, surprise: it was Glen Gore, the guy who, in retrospect, had been an obvious suspect from the start.
He was sentenced a few years later to life in prison without parole – but by that time, Ron Williamson was already dead.
Diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver, Williamson died in a Broken Arrow, Oklahoma nursing home on December 4, 2004, a year after he won a settlement for wrongful conviction from the City of Ada, and two years before Grisham published his book and Glen Gore was sentenced.
The Murder of Denice Haraway
Two years after the murder of Debbie Carter, another young girl in her 20s with a night job, disappeared in the small town of Ada: Donna Denice Haraway.
Married about a year before her disappearance, Haraway was a 24-year-old student at East Central working at a convenience store.
Two young men were seen in the vicinity of the store on the night of her disappearance.
Naturally, they were the prime suspects.
The police received many calls from concerned citizens; no less than 25 names were given by these callers as suspects.
Two names immediately stood out by the sheer number of mentions: Billy Charley and Tommy Ward.
Billy Charley had an alibi: he had been with his parents all through the night. Tommy Ward’s alibi was rather different: he said that he had been fishing and partying with a friend, Karl Fontenot; apparently, that didn’t happen.
It didn’t help that Tommy was a high-school dropout arrested several times for misdemeanors such as public drunkenness or petty theft.
The police were rather sure that they had their man; or, better yet: their men.
When Tommy Ward was called yet again for an interview, he was asked several times to use his imagination to explain what could have happened in the case of Denice Haraway’s disappearance.
And one day, after a grueling eight-hour session, Ward confessed to the crime; shortly after Fontenot did as well.
They were tried for first-degree murder even though they could not tell where the body of Haraway was and even though they had both recanted their confessions.
And it gets even weirder.
You see – and, in a moment, you’ll realize why this is the strangest part – the reason why Tommy and Karl couldn’t provide the body of Denice was simple: they said that they had burned it.
It was a gruesome story, involving “stab wounds, the blood and guts, the brutal raping and knifing of such a pretty girl, then the horrible burning of her body.”
The only problem: it wasn’t true.
How do we know that?
Well, on January 21, 1986, in the woods some twenty miles from Ada, the body of Denice Haraway was discovered by a hunter. 
The body was neither stabbed nor burned.
The cause of death?
A single gunshot wound through her head. 
“The true cause of death should have convinced everyone involved that Ward and Fontenot had indeed dreamed up their ridiculous tales and had been coerced into confessing,” writes Grisham. “It did not.”
Even more: “the true cause of death should have prompted the authorities to admit they were wrong and begin searching for the real murderer. It did not.”
Instead:
This one’s not even remotely a happy one.
Eventually, Ward and Fontenot were granted retrials, but they were, once again, found guilty.
And to this day they are on a death row, imprisoned for more than three decades.
Even though everybody knows that it’s very, very likely that they are serving time for a murder committed by someone else.
Key Lessons from “The Innocent Man”
1.      Truth Is Sometimes Stranger Than Fiction
2.      Your Dreams Can Get You a Death Sentence
3.      This Will Happen Again
Truth Is Sometimes Stranger Than Fiction
 “If I wrote 
as a novel,” says John Grisham in an interview for 
’s docuseries based on his book, “folks probably wouldn’t believe it.”
And you know what – we wouldn’t.
Two mysterious murders occur in a town of 15.000 people in the space of two years; for each, two people are found guilty; the prosecutor is the same guy for both trials; the investigators – more or less, the same team.
And it doesn’t stop there: in both cases, dreams of the accused are treated as confessions; in both cases, the main witness is the same, a jailhouse informant; finally, in both cases, the men turn out to be innocent. 
If it was a novel, the reviews would have probably been littered with words such as “improbable,” “implausible,” “unconvincing,” “unlikely,” and even “ridiculous.”
And yet – to quote Paul Thomas Anderson’s 
 – 
. 
Your Dreams Can Get You a Death Sentence
Speaking of truth being stranger than fiction – 
You’ve probably read/watched Philip K. Dick’s/Steven Spielberg’s 
; if not, in it, people are arrested 
 even committing a crime based on the foreknowledge of three psychics called precogs.
In an even better example, in Ismail Kadare’s exceptional 1981 novel 
, there’s a whole shady Ministry which analyzes dreams and suggests punishments for people based on dream symbolism.
Apparently, this can happen in real life as well: believe it or not, the dreams of both Williamson in relation to the murder of Debra Sue Carter and Ward and Fontenot’s in relation to the murder of Denice Haraway were treated as real confessions!
Even 
 the evidence demonstrated that they are (unsurprisingly!) incompatible with reality.
For all the weight 
 and 
 put on the significance of dreams, we kind of feel that this is a great example of why 
.
This Will Happen Again
The main takeaway from this book?
Dreams and tampering with evidence aside, innocent people will get convicted again and again – not only because our police and justice system is 
 nor 
, but also because 
.
And we need to both accept that 
 work against it as well.
As far as cases such as these are concerned, the Innocence Project is a great start.

“The Innocent Man Quotes”
Our Critical Review
is “a gritty, harrowing, true-crime story” that should serve to remind everybody that, as opposed to novels, in reality, justice often goes astray.
In real life, policemen and detectives are not superheroes, but ordinary people who can not only make mistakes but who can also, sometimes, even 
 ignore the facts so as to add another solved crime to their résumés.
is a great reminder that this can sometimes lead to the death of an innocent man; and, as we learned from John Donne and Hemingway, the death of every innocent man on this planet is 
 responsibility.

Do you remember the chicken and the egg dilemma?
I will rephrase it. I’ll put it in this book’s context:
As simple as this question may seem, as complicated the answer is. You have to take a complete journey through 3 chapters and 5 eras to find out which are the key concepts in order to define the solution.
Can we live in a better world? Can we change the power of example the world we are living in? Should the world adapt to leaders or the leaders to the world?
If you are searching the answers to these questions you can find them in Dale Partridge ‘s book: 
“People Over Profit Summary”
The author dedicated his life to making a difference and challenge the way of thinking of leaders, of all of us. He is trying to make a change through his example of leading with a 
 mentality.
is structured in three parts. Each part describes a situation or moment that we can find ourselves in.
The first part of the book is to clear up the situation for all companies that want to change their direction. Every company at the beginning is starting with an era of honesty and truth.
Now it’s the time when the companies are more focused on satisfying customers. In order to do that competitive teams are created to work with. For Dale Partridge, this is a good argument for defining the present time as a great one with a clear focus on leaders, benefits for both company and customers, and long-term strategies.
Our human nature is designed to tirelessly seek more and more performance and efficiency.
This proves that the

This era is usually described by terms as struggle and choices. This is the moment when the company is choosing her path to go from now on. If the leaders are blind and have a limited vision about the way things should be done, probably the long-term strategy will fail.

This kind of leading is wrong. You may already conclude it by yourself. Dale also says clearly in his book: putting a great accent on effects.
Fortunately, even in this era of lies and poor management, there is room for good changes.
Let’s say we find ourselves in this situation. Everything is going apart and we are searching for new ways to overcome failures.
It’s not too late to start again and try to fix everything that was going in the wrong direction. It is time for our company to enter the

Naturally, after a preview like this, we are hunted by a key question: What can I do to have the Honest Era on my side as a long-term strategy?
Dale gives us a very good answer and he teaches us how we can act and react to be in the same era of the transparency and truth. To go on further in the “

Maybe the most precious lesson we should learn from Dale’s books is to learn to make a difference. More healthy minds can create a healthy environment, a healthy world. The change may start at an individual level but, definitely, grow stronger and stronger collectively.

Don’t worry; no one is asking of you to risk your life in order to gain financial stability.
That’s just absurd.
You are only required to rethink your assumptions regarding finances.
What’s the purpose in accumulating debt, when you have no knowledge on how to handle it?
That’s what we will be discussing in this summary.
Let’s roll!
Who Should Read “Second Chance”? And Why?
Are you ready to cross the Rubicon?
The exact opposite of pursuing job security is striving to achieve financial freedom. 
Robert Kiyosaki galvanized millions of people into action, and “
” acts as a blueprint that will help you stay ahead of the game.
That is why we believe it to be an immensely powerful and enlightening read.
About Robert T. Kiyosaki
 is a well-known businessman, entrepreneur, speaker and a financial coach that spells out the ingredients needed for achieving success in the digital age.
Above all else, he is the author of several bestselling books such as:
“Second Chance PDF Summary”
Robert Kiyosaki divided this book into three parts: 
The Past
As you might have guessed, Robert starts with the past. He recalls meeting a friend whom he had not seen in a while. 
Robert was slightly shocked seeing his friend working at Starbucks. 
What are you doing here, he asked?
His friend replied that after the market crash in 2007 he lost his job and house. He burned his life savings and was forced to apply for a low paying job.
He even enrolled in University to get a Master’s degree.
Student loans? – 
. 
Well, what else can we do? – 
.
Robert paid for his coffee and hit the road. 
Out of this life-situation, Robert wants to point out some irrefutable business realities:
In the past, the landlords were the ones who nowadays we’d regard as rich. They controlled, embezzled, and utilized resources available at hand. 
The ordinary person, however, without any ties to the aristocracy, was destined for hard labor. 
In the age of digital expansionism, where access to valuable information is often free, why aren’t more people rich? It takes knowledge to process information into practical expertise, and when you are going to Universities, you are not taught how to do that.
The birth of the lost generation is yet another phenomenon that plagues society. It’s merely an illustration of the college-educated generation which is not able to find a job that matches their level of ambition.
Such reality lowers their earning potential during midlife years and leads to an increase in debt.
It might come as a shock to you but, student loans are rarely forgiven. In other words, even if you declare bankruptcy, there’s hardly a chance that you’ll get past the expensive journey you undertook in your early adulthood.
Robert Kiyosaki calls them “
.”
Kids who leave home, only to return broke and in total hopelessness.
Many experts fear a New Great Depression. 
The best way to look at the future is by being critical of the past. 
What are the key indicators that foreshadow an economic malaise?
Robert Kiyosaki gives a lot of credit to Dr. Fuller who taught him how to predict the future and how to capitalize on emergencies.
The 2007 Market Fall was one of them.
Politicians will continue to sweep the problems under the rug, and it’s your job to take care of the financial future.
People struggle because of a lack of financial knowledge, and the inability to distinguish between assets and liabilities.
An old saying goes: 
Rich Dad believes that getting financial advice from someone who doesn’t eat unless they sell you something, is a dangerous game.
According to Warren Buffett, it’s of primary importance to understand the difference between a sales pitch, and valuable financial advice.
Part Two – Present
We hate to rock your world, but those who place trust in the government to take care of them are in for a big surprise.
The Obamacare act was greeted with admiration and delight.
The Social Security Act made life easier for the WW2 generation but at the expense of the Vietnam War Generation. 
Only time will tell whether the Obama Act will become a Social and Medical liability or better yet a “Burden” for the upcoming generations. 
Robert Kiyosaki asserts that the real instigator of Economic Slumps is our external-makeover mindset.
What does it mean?
It points out that one’s yearnings and lust for status, doesn’t help you to become wealthy. 
Appearing is much easier, than actually being, to say the least!
Second Chance, as an aspect, must be brought into line with the process of metamorphosis. Can you turn into a butterfly and, fly away?
We all have this potential, but not everyone is cognizant of its abilities.
So, the real question is – What is holding you back? 
Robert brings up the importance of being able to read your financial statement. And yes, you would argue that you already know how to do that, but that’s usually not the case.
These days, people prefer to look richer by distorting the actual reality.
Even with higher income, they can’t keep up with the incurred liabilities.
It took us 25 years to get out of the Great Depression (1929-1954), and the Federal Government did nothing in particular to appease the suffering. New policies were enacted in the 30s, and the WW2 period, but to no avail.
What does that tell you? 
Big Government ≠ Low Poverty Rates
The main thing no one has ever told you is that rich people don’t work for money.
They try to own the means of production; they are not in pursuit of higher wages, etc. In other words, they are entrepreneurs from top to bottom. They nurture an entrepreneurial spirit which helps them to see the world through the lens of possibilities.
The second chance you’ve been praying to get is finally at your doorstep.
In any financial statement, there are four basic asset-classes you can stumble upon:
Just take a moment, and find out which one of these appeals to your entrepreneurial nature, the most.
From what we’ve been told, it’s easy to see why “savers” can’t and will not get rich. The quick rich scheme should also be discarded, not that miracles don’t happen, but you shouldn’t count on luck to do all the heavy lifting.
Kiyosaki shares his past fondness for commodities, gold & silver in particular.
Before you lay out the type of investment you would want to venture in, it’s critical to exhibit some kind of love towards the process of building that asset. 
And last but not least – find out the game that could bring you money or the one you love to be a part of. History has shown us that a blend of commitment and passion increases the likelihood of a positive outcome.
The Future
Why does the education system skip the part about managing finances?
The fact that students learn nothing about money is why they end up drowning in debt upon graduation.
When you deny education to certain groups (like slaves or women in the past), you are in control of their destiny. In some parts of the world, this practice is still around.
Believe it or not, the person who signs the paycheck exerts a lot of influence over the receiver. 
The idea work harder doesn’t seem to make any sense – Why?
Because the more you earn, the tax-percentage gets bigger. And, that’s a clear indication of why the middle-class is shrinking with each passing generation. 
The top 1% pay less than 13% in taxes, while the upper middle class pays up to 50%. 
Are the rich gaming the system?
No!
That’s exactly what financial education does; it teaches you how to save your earnings and eradicate liabilities.
Poor Dad teaches you to work for money; Rich Dad teaches you to acquire assets.
If you are working to produce Cash Flow, you are on the right track. 
However, if you are more into getting a higher paycheck, then you have the mindset of the Poor Dad.
You want to watch out for debt and taxes because they will rise proportionally with your paycheck.
Robert Kiyosaki is a great fan of playing games that could help you think critically. In the meantime, you are getting ready for the actual world.
Mistake-learning method is the only one that can be deemed effective.
But what about education?
It’s more important than ever, but that doesn’t mean that by going to college you’ll get what you’ve bargained for.
When it comes to the United States of America, which of the following poses a greater menace to national security?
The proper answer would be – Both!
The future is not pretty with regards to the US economy. Financial education is not being delivered, and the nation is in deep slumber.
Is there a way to turn the tables on this?
Bucky Fuller said:
Having unshakable faith is your ticket to financial freedom, and it opens up the door for getting a second chance.
On top of that, we live in a Start-Up world. 
Everyone dreams of becoming the next Elon Musk, or Steve Jobs.
However, nine out of ten business fail within the first five years. 
The reason for their failure is what Robert Kiyosaki calls – over-specialization. 
When you know a lot about little, you’re missing on the broader picture, crucial for staying in the game.
One of the things that people don’t realize is that entrepreneurs never sleep.
It’s partly the reason why so many start-ups fail, and why so many people prefer employee status. They don’t have to worry about regulations, product costs, investments, marketing, equipment costs, taxes, etc.
Remember, specialists, work for generalists.
As a matter of fact, that’s the whole story behind “
.”
No one can say for certain that one thing is better than the other because it varies on a case to case basis.
You have all the flexibility in the world to make up your mind and do what’s necessary to achieve financial freedom.
Key Lessons from “Second Chance”
1.      Change your perspective
2.      Generalists are the money makers
3.      Big shoes to fill
Change your perspective
We don’t believe that everyone is predestined to become an entrepreneur, but that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t change your spending habits.
It truly is an important transition that will help you build your financial freedom and security.
Generalists are the money makers
It’s needless to say that to run a business; you’d have to have a broader outlook on the processes. To put it differently, you’d have to expand your field your expertise in order to lay down the rules and make profitable decisions.
Not too many people can do that!
Big shoes to fill
Nobody said it was going to be easy.
And one of the biggest problems one can think of is – not having enough money to launch this twist.
Anyway, you don’t need a million dollars to start investing.

Who Should Read “Where the Crawdads Sing”? And Why?
According to the blurb, 
 should be “perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell.”
Also, it would be perfect for everyone who likes nature and detailed descriptions of it: after all, Delia Owens is a wildlife scientist by trade, and she manages to translate her passion in every single word of her debut novel.

Plot
Christopher Scotton, the author of 
, describes the genre of Owens’ debut novel as “a murder mystery/love story/courtroom drama” and sums up its plot as “a compelling tale of a forgotten girl in the unforgiving coastal marshes of North Carolina.”
That forgotten girl is the main protagonist in our story, and her name is 
, and the unforgiving coastal marshes of North Carolina are, more specifically, the surroundings of Barkley Cove in the 1960s.
So that you can orient yourself better in time and space, the book comes packed with a nice, little map which we felt obliged to include in our summary as well:
The story is told in many flashbacks and flashforwards, and it doesn’t mirror the structure below in entirety. 
That is because in the novel the years aren’t actually the titles of the chapters; even so, all of the chapters include the year of the events described in them.
For our summary – since, after all, it is a summary – we grouped the chapters by year. Hopefully, in combination with the map, this will help you follow the story better.
Let’s go!
Part One
The book begins with a beautiful two-paragraph description of a marsh, coupled with an explanation of what is the difference between it and a swamp:
On the morning of October 30, 1969 – we are suddenly informed, and our blood is chilled to the bone – the body of someone named 
was spotted in the marshes, near the fire tower, by two boys riding their bikes in the vicinity.
We go seventeen years back in time to observe the six-year-old 
 – actually 
– running to the porch only so that she can see her 
 leaving her and her family in a long black skirt, gator heels, a blue train case in her hand.
 a World War II veteran with a disability, is an abusive alcoholic. So, it’s no wonder that after the flight of Ma, all of Kya’s siblings – 
,
,
, and 
 – leave as well. 
Before too long, Kya and Pa are the only ones left in the rather isolated shack erected in the vicinity of Barkley Cove.
Since Pa isn’t that interested in taking care of Kya – at least not in the usual way – Kya attends school for no more than one single day.
The problem?
She barely looks like a human child, reminding her schoolmates much more of a feral kid; incapable of enduring the laughs and scorn of her schoolmates, Kya leaves school illiterate and unkempt – to never return to it again.
Even though a child, Kya is pretty independent and self-reliant; however, one day, after she takes her father’s boat, she gets lost in the lagoon.
Fortunately, a boy from the town named 
– four years her senior – notices her and helps her.
Hoping to see Tate again, Kya asks to go fishing with her father; and everything’s nice for a while. But then, a letter from her mother arrives; Kya’s Pa burns it and, ever since then, staunchly refuses to take Kya out to fishing again.
Back in 1969, we learn some more details about the death of Chase Andrews.
A former star quarterback, working at his parent’s store Western Auto at the time of his death, Chase Andrews was (as you would only expect after such a description) a pretty handsome guy who had his way with the ladies of Barkley Cove.
He was also engaged, but hey, we’re not here to judge; all we know at this point is that we’re dealing with yet another episode of the show “lest you want to sleep with the fishes, avoid sleeping with the chicks.”
After being alerted by the two boys we mentioned above – the ten-year-old 
 and 
 – the sheriff discovers traces of red wool fibers at the scene; there are no fingerprints.
Kya is 10 in 1956.
One day, her Pa leaves the shack and doesn’t come back.
Knowing full well that she’ll be taken away by social services unless she pretends that her father is still around, she does just that.
In order to earn money, she starts collecting mussels and starts selling these to a guy nicknamed 
.
Jumpin’ – who has a bait and gas shop nearby – soon realizes that Kya is in trouble.
So, he asks for some help from his wife 
, who mobilizes the community, collecting donations at the church and trading them for Kya’s fish.
In addition, Mabel teaches Kya how to garden and gives her some seeds so that she can start gardening.
Four years pass and Barkley Cove is filled with rumors about a certain 
; Kya – who has learned to live well in solitude by know – unwittingly reinforces them, since she is constantly in hiding.
Not only from the social services, but also from the kids banging on her door and pranking her the way they did on her first and only day at school.
In the meantime, Kya has also mastered the art of collecting, well, everything.
One day, a boy leaves a heron feather on a tree stump in the marsh; before too long, Kya starts communicating with him via feathers.
Soon enough, she learns of his identity: it’s none other than the only warm human being she has ever met: 
. 
Tate not only gives Kya many useful things (spark plug, seeds, etc.), but he also teaches her to read. And when their meetings alert the social services, he also suggests to her that she leaves the shack and go “where the crawdads sing”:
Kya is 14 years old in 1960 and is very beautiful; one day, as Tate talks about his younger sister and his mother who died in a car crash, the two kiss.
The romance lasts for a while, but Tate has to leave for college; he tells Kya that he’ll be back for her in a month.
However, he’s not. 
Heartbroken, Kya moves on.
Part Two
By 1965, another guy has developed a crush on Kya.
And that guy is who else if not Chase Andrews – the one with whose dead body we started off our journey.
Chase invites Kya on a picnic date, but he’s just too sexually aggressive for Kya to accept his advances; so she runs off.
However, Chase is stubborn and continues to pursue Kya, even taking her to the fire tower next to which his body had been found.
Finally, he gets the girl.
To make matters more complicated, in the meantime, Tate – now a 23-year-old graduate – comes back for Kya.
We learn that he actually did the same thing five years back, but that he backed off at the final minute, realizing that Kya did not fit in with his world.
However, his new realization (namely, that this was a serious mistake) comes a bit too late: after coming back from Chapel Hill, he finds out that Kya is with Chase now.
Among other things, Kya gives Chase a shell necklace made by her; Chase promises to treasure it as long as he lives.
Chase’s mother, 
, reveals to the police that, in fact, he did just that: Chase had Kya’s shell necklace on him at all times, every single day.
However, the coroner reveals that it was not found on the body, making Kya a suspect, especially after one man mentions that he had seen her in the vicinity on the night of Chase’s murder.
The police get a search warrant for her house.
Unfortunately, inside they find a red wool hat.
Let’s cover the interim period, between Chase wooing Kya, Tate returning from Chapel Hill and the events leading up to the murder of Chase.
A few years before the last thing happened, Chase had asked Kya’s hand in marriage. Soon after, Kya was visited by Tate – who wanted, you know, to apologize and explain himself.
However, during that visit, Tate noticed Kya’s nature diagrams and offered to help her find a publisher. Subsequently, he did do just that, and Kya had her first book published.
In the meantime, she also discovers an unpleasant truth – namely, that Chase is still a ladies’ men and probably engaged.
In 1968, another significant thing happens: Jodie, Kya’s brother, returns to Barkley Cove.
Even though her last sighting of him was when she was barely a six-year-old child, Kya recognizes him due to a scar on his face – Pa’s work, of course.
Jodie returns after happening upon Kya’s book; he tells her that their mother is dead, having died two years before his return.
Kya is arrested soon after Chase Andrews’ murder: all the evidence points to her and the fact that Chase tried raping Kya a month before his death gives her a clear motive.
Two months after being put in jail, the trial of Kya begins.
After her publisher testifies that he had dinner with her on the night of the murder, she is finally found not guilty, and Chase’s murder is ruled an accident.
However, the trial leaves Kya disillusioned with the city: Tate is the only one actually caring about her and visiting her in jail.
Kya realizes that Tate was the one all along and that she too had made a mistake.
The sad news about the death of Tate’s father reunites the two, and they start a life together.
Where the Crawdads Sing Epilogue
Of course, this is not a fairytale, so Tate and Kya do not have the luxury of living happily ever after.
However, they do remain together for the next four decades when Kya passes away, aged 64; at the bequest of Tate, her headstone is inscribed thus: “The Marsh Girl.”
After Kya’s death, Tate looks through her possessions and comes across a hidden compartment filled with many poems signed Amanda Hamilton, a popular local poet.
Among them, there’s one describing the murder of Chase, and, inside it, Tate finds Chase’s missing shell necklace.
Amanda Hamilton was actually Kya’s pseudonym, and Chase’s murderer was none other than her!
Tate drops the necklace in the ocean and burns all of Kya’s poems, deciding to bury the secret with him.

You think you know which foods are healthy and which are not?
Steven R. Gundry, MD, thought the same as well– until he decided to go with an against-the-grain diet (pun intended) and started feeling 
 better.
He shares his findings in perhaps the most controversial book on the topic published during the past few years:
Who Should Read “The Plant Paradox”? And Why?
If you are already aware of your unhealthy dietary habits, then we don’t need to tell you that any food-related book written by a doctor or a scientist is the next book you should read – nay, implement in your life; the same holds true if you feel uncomfortable in your body due to obesity or overweight.
goes a step further: as its blurb states, the book “illuminates the hidden dangers lurking in your salad bowl,” meaning that it attempts to show you which parts of your regular healthy foods are 
unhealthy.
Think gluten in relation to wheat: you can eat the latter, but, as we recently found out, the former can cause severe inflammations in your body. Well, according to Gundry, gluten is just one of a variety of very similar and equally toxic plant-based proteins called lectins.
Want to do away with them? Think that you’re actually eating healthy but still having problems trimming down your weight or doing away with some nagging pains and inflammations suggesting autoimmune diseases?
Then 
may be for your; but, please, before reading the book, read our summary first and find out more about the benefits and risks of a lectin-free diet.
About Steven R. Gundry
 is an American cardiac surgeon, bestselling author, and a researcher in food and nutrition.
After graduating 
 from Yale University, Gundry went on to earn a medical degree from the Medical College of Georgia in 1977. A pioneering researcher in cardiology, Gundry invented a few devices that reverse the cell death in heart attacks and was featured in a story by 
magazine in 1990.
After completing a fellowship in congenital heart surgery at the Hospital for Sick Children, and two years as a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Gundry was recruited as professor and chairman of cardiothoracic surgery at Loma Linda University School of Medicine, a Seventh-day Adventist health sciences university.
In 2000, after supposedly curing an “inoperable” patient via a combination of nutraceutical supplements and dietary changes, Gundry left Loma Linda University and established the International Heart and Lung Institute in California, where he currently devotes his time to researching the possibilities for “dietary and nutraceutical reversal of most diseases.”
He has published several books on the topic, including

“The Plant Paradox PDF Summary”
“Suppose that in the next few pages I told you that everything you thought you knew about your diet, your health, and your weight is wrong” – writes Steven Gundry in the very first sentence of 
.
His point?
If you’re overweight and unhealthy even though you’ve tried every single diet (low-carb, low-fat, paleo, low-glycemic) and every single exercise regime (running, speed walking, weight training, aerobics, CrossFit, yoga, core training, spinning, high-intensity interval training), then could it be that the problem is not with you, but with the diets and the regimes?
“Your health problems are not your fault,” states Gundry explicitly before confidently pointing out that his book intends to change all of that:
And so are we – so let’s walk you through Gundry’s arguments and findings.
The Attack of the Lectins
. 
Consequently, if you are as small as a mosquito or as slow as a sloth, you better have another defense mechanism at your disposal, for unless you are capable of biting or your flesh has an awful taste, then evolution is not exactly going to be your best friend.
But where does this leave plants then?
Apparently, they are no different – they too have defense mechanisms, even the most innocuous among them; in other words, a plant doesn’t need to be poisonous for you to think that it is unwilling to be eaten by you.
Now, the most common defense mechanism in plants is a group of complex proteins called lectins; you can find them in the grains, skins, seeds, and leaves of most plants.
What they do is, when you consume a plant which contains them, they bind to the sugar molecules in your brain and nerve endings causing something known as “brain fog.” 
You know what we’re talking about: it’s when you get all drowsy, have trouble focusing and experience memory difficulties.
Additionally, some of these lectins also result in you gaining some weight:
We’ve told you before: 
.
But there’s more to it.
The Microbes in Your Belly
: about 90% of the cells in your body are non-human microbes, most of which you need to survive because they are the ones which convert the food you eat into energy.
And most of these microbes are imprisoned in your belly; if some of them leave your intestinal tract, then you’re in for a serious problem: your body treats these microbes as imposters, and your immune system suddenly goes haywire.
So, you have a proper Civil War inside your own body: some cells are attacking other cells even though, in essence, they are on the same team.
And this is what we call an autoimmune disease.
How is this important in relation to the lectins mentioned above?
Well, we’ve recently discovered that lectins increase the permeability of your intestines, allowing the microbes to leave your belly and move into unknown territory.
So, in a way, many of your autoimmune diseases may appear because you eat wheat and some other plants.
?
Not so much: it is exactly because of the lectins in the bran that your body attacks itself.
Baguettes, ciabattas, white rice – they are all bran-free.
And there’s a reason why they are the staples of some of the healthiest cuisines of the world: French, Italian, and Asian.
The Four Rules of the Plant Paradox Program
According to Steven Gundry, “these four simple rules will enable you to experience success on the Plant Paradox Program.”
The Plant Paradox Program is more about the things you shouldn’t eat than it is about the things you should. 
This should, after all, be as obvious as a platitude: you help your health much more if you say “no” to one bad thing than if you say “yes” to ten good and still consume that bad thing.
This rule sounds even better when told in laymen’s terms: “give your gut bugs what they want, and nobody gets hurt.”
And when we mean your gut bugs – we do mean your good gut bugs; unfortunately, your bad dietary habits and all those antibiotics you’ve used in the past few decades have all but decimated them by now; the bad ones may be the majority there, in your gut.
So, stop feeding them junk food (sugar, refined carbs, and saturated fat); they’ll have to leave and make room for the return of your friends, the good gut bugs.
According to Steven R. Gundry, the difference between a bowl of Skittles and a fruit salad is all but negligible: “it’s the same poisonous stuff,” he says.
The only three fruits you can eat – and, mind you, only when they are green – are bananas, mangoes, and papayas. 
Every single other fruit should be off the table.
And if you have doubts over whether something is a fruit or vegetable – then, rule number 3 has a corollary: “if it has seeds, it’s fruit!”
In other words, even though you think you’re eating meat, you are actually also eating corn and soybeans, because that’s what industrially raised food animals are regularly fed with.
And that’s not a good thing.
Key Lessons from “The Plant Paradox”

2.      The Four Rules of the Plant Paradox Program
3.      The Plant Paradox Program
Lectins Are Bad for Your Health – and They Can Be Found in Healthy Foods
Lectins are, by their very nature, weak poisons: once they enter your body (and they do every time you consume fruits, wheat, legumes, etc.), they bind with the sugar molecules in your nerves and cause “brain fog” (loss of focus, memory problem).
In addition, they also make the intestinal tract more permeable allowing the microbes from your gut to spill into unknown areas of your body where they are treated as impostors; hence – autoimmune diseases.
Finally, some of them – such as the WGA in wheat – increase your weight; this was great for our ancestors when they needed “wheat belly” for the months when they had nothing to eat; but it’s bad for you – since you always have something to eat.
The Four Rules of the Plant Paradox Program
Steven Gundry’s Plant Paradox Program is focused on eliminating lectins from your diet; and it is based on four rules:
#1. What you stop eating has more impact on your help than what you start eating;
#2. Give your gut bugs what they want and starve the bad bugs (see #1);
#3. Treat fruit (everything with seeds) exactly as you would treat candy; and
#4. You are what the thing you are eating ate, aka you’re not eating meat but the soya it was fed with.
The Plant Paradox Program
Now, 
 – and, consequently, the Plant Paradox Program – abounds with many “yes’s” and even more “no’s,” in addition to numerous sample meal plans and recipes.
It’s both difficult to summarize even a tenth of them and unfair to choose only one or two; for that, you’ll need to consult the book.
However, consider this a good rule-of-thumb: don’t eat any fruit aside from green bananas, papayas, and mangoes, avoid refined, starchy foods, nuts and seeds, oils, grains and legumes – and you should do just fine.
At least Gwyneth Paltrow and Tony Robbins say so.

“The Plant Paradox Quotes”
Our Critical Review
According to some doctors and professors (Terry Wahls, Dale Bredesen, Jonathan Karp) and numerous celebrities (
, Kelly Clarkson, Gwyneth Paltrow), Gundry’s lectin-free diet works exceptionally well. 
So much so that at least one or two people have deemed Gundry a once-in-a-generation doctor and 
a “once-in-a-generation” book.
Now, we’re not doctors, and we don’t know for sure if Steven R. Gundry is right about lectins; but we feel obliged to tell you that, according to many other doctors and researchers, he’s not.
“To put it generously,” says 
, “it is fair to say that Dr. Gundry has not made a convincing argument that lectins as a class are hazardous.” 
 are not so subtle calling Gundry a quack and “gobbledygook” scientist trying to make a quick buck.
The latter sure seems at least a possibility: as far as we understood from a quick research, lectins are actually a pretty large and complex group of proteins, and even though some of them are toxic, others are actually beneficial.In other words, if you want our advice: don’t jump the lectin-free bandwagon before you see where it’s heading;

We all want to know “When” to do something or hit the perfect timing. 
It seems as if, many questions are still ignored and looking the other way has not helped.
Daniel Pink sheds light on the process of building that momentum, and understand the nature of human psychology.
It’s needless to say that delving into this matter could be of particular use to society and the individual.
So, let’s unravel it!  
Who Should Read “When”? And Why?
While reading, we were positively shocked to hear about the importance of getting the timing right. Most often, we take this to be a trivial and less important thing to be worried about, but the facts paint a different picture.
Apparently, it’s absurd to designate a leader who could head-up this whole initiative.
With that said “
” is clearly a must-have or better must-read for everyone who wants to go through the aspects of human psychology.
These tendencies vary on a case to case basis but are a great reminder of how people behave and react at different stages of life.
About Daniel H. Pink
 is a revolutionary within the confines of biology and psychology and was the co-executive producer of the National Geographic Channel.
He mainly covers topics that revolve around business, behavioral science and psychology.
Amongst other things, he is a best-selling author according to the New York Times Magazine.
“When PDF Summary”
Michael Macy and Scott Golder, professors from Cornell University, conducted a comprehensive study regarding human emotional patterns. They analyzed more than 500 million tweets, coming from every corner of the world and came to a startling discovery. 
It was the consistency that left them shocked not the discrepancy as one might have guessed. According to the study, tweeters were displaying energetic and enthusiastic behavior in the morning and experienced a deteriorating mood in the afternoon; while in the evenings, they’d normally perk up.
The tweeter’s background or religious beliefs had nothing to do with this flow. 
Nearly three centuries before this sociological breakthrough, scientists have already explained or established the biological clock theory. 
It was predicated on the understanding that all living things, regardless of their structure, have it. 
The DRM (Day Reconstruction Method) designed by behavioral scientists provides us with more data and tracks hour-to-hour mood changes.
British and Swedish professors compiled a list of questions that ultimately became the first test designed to measure our internal clock system.
This was later improved at the hands of distinguished chrono-biologists Martha Merrow and Till Roenneberg. 
They coined a few terms to explain how our body functions during the 24-hour time frame: Larks, Third Birds, Owls.
It may seem complex and very misleading at first glance, but let’s dig up a bit. 
To understand their perspective on human behavior, you have to answer the following questions:
On the chart below you can get a glimpse into how humans are categorized regarding this matter:
The lion’s share goes to 
. 
Most of us actually fall into this category, because we are on neither side of the extremes. In a practical sense, this indicates that you go to bed somewhere between 11-12PM, and wake up at around 7-9AM. 
Genetics also argues that people on the extremes are not made, as many would assume, but born. 
For Thomas Edison, his fellow scientists often said: 
According to Daniel Pink, age is also one of the driving factors that determine one’s chronotype. For example, teenagers tend to be leaning more towards Owls, and that’s not surprising. Their midpoint in sleep is around 6-7AM, while most parents fall into larks. 
When it comes to the sexes, men and women also slightly differ in this regard.
According to the study, men tilt toward eveningness, while women toward morningness.
So that would cover the basic behavior tendencies that we as humans tend to nurture, both consciously and unconsciously.
There’s a dilemma going around:
How to figure out our daily “WHEN.”
The most straightforward would be by adhering to the three-step method.
Daniel advises you to track your behavior on a weekly basis. Hence, you need to answer these three questions every ninety minutes:
You can use your smartphone, or whatever device you have at your disposal to set up an alarm clock and follow the exercise.
Let’s give this task the benefit of the doubt, and ponder about the difficulty of optimizing your schedule.
It’s impossible to make it flawless, and it’s not advisable to circumvent the issue. 
So, the one thing you can do is minimize the adverse effects by:
They say: Each morning is a new chance to fulfill your dreams. 
In addition to that, let’s list four tips for getting the most out of this very despised time of day:
Daniel believes that the emotional and cognitive aspects of our lives are the ones that deserve the attention. With that said, it’s utterly destructive to neglect the physical element by labeling it as insignificant.
He encourages people to do a bit of morning exercising, and states the reason:
People openly argue about the need for good night’s rest, and how to define the perfect bedtime. Nowadays, when productivity is regarded as the most valuable gem, and society struggles to adhere to this principle, mapping out a plan seems like the only option.
– Find the best time to take a nap (ideally between 2.pm and 3. pm)
– Find a peaceful place
– Drink a cup of coffee before you decide to catch forty winks
– Set a timer (30 minutes nap is the perfect time to reinvigorate yourself)
– Rinse and repeat
In chapter 3, Daniel addresses the issue of marriage.
It comes as no surprise that people have this natural urge for reproduction, and science is clear on this. So, the question which raises many eyebrows is – When is the perfect time to tie the knot?
Here are three general guidelines that you ought to follow:
In 2010, Nobel Prize-winning economist Angus Deaton teamed up with four social scientists and created the age distribution curve of well-being. They interviewed approximately 340,000 people and got the following results:
We get the impression of a U-curve that slightly slumps in the middle and goes back up again. 
The same applies to both sexes, and the differences are literally non-existent with regard to life-happiness over the years. Numerous studies conducted in the aftermath of this revelation only validated the deep-rooted theory.
The most shocking piece of the puzzle was the fact that even monkeys exhibit the same mood or well-being trajectory. Zookeepers and animal researchers used advanced techniques to get to the bottom of this phenomenon.
The question is, how to cheer up after a midlife slump?
Is there something we can do?
In fact, there are five steps that when implemented correctly could invigorate you:
Bruce Tuckman, an organizational psychologist, refined a theory which showed how groups progressed through time:
Brené Brown presents an all-encompassing definition of midlife:
But you are entitled to a response and here’s what you should do:
Let’s look at a case.
In the early 1930s, Mildred Marie Wilson gave birth to a boy – James Byron Dean. Jimmy enjoyed a happy life, as his family moved from Indiana to Southern Carolina right about the time he was starting at school.
A couple of years later, his mom died of cancer, and Jimmy’s father sent him back to live with his relatives.
He finished high-school and was raised in the traditional American spirit. 
In 1951, he dropped out of UCLA, to pursue an acting career. He was lucky to secure a couple of commercial and TV roles at such a young age. 
At the age of 23, he was cast in the film adaptation of a John Steinbeck novel.
The movie quickly became a blockbuster and got him a nomination for an Oscar. That same year, he even landed a bigger role, which earned him the Oscar.
Four months before his 25
 birthday, James Dean died in a car accident. 
Daniel Pink tries to ascertain which of the following scenarios is better:
According to researchers, people tend to rate higher the Jimmy scenario – pointing to an upturn.
In all honesty, our lives are not always dramatic, but they do entail turmoil and challenges. 
With that said, Daniel Pink believes that the life-curve unfolds as a three-act drama:
Key Lessons from “When”
1.      The “When” is not rigid
2.      Nurture ideas that can sustain you
3.      Thrust through life
The “When” is not rigid
Even though we listed a couple of universal truths, that doesn’t mean that you cannot influence your personal “When.”
And yes, it’s not as straightforward as many people assume to get an aerial view of how things unfold.
But, it’s great to start from the hurdles that block your path to enlightenment in the mattering question.
Nurture ideas that can sustain you
The key in life is to learn and mature inwardly. 
If the focus is predominately placed on your well-being, then you have to be very careful with regards to the mindset you cultivate.
As a matter of fact, people often cling to worthless ideas, that produce disastrous results in the long-haul. 
Thrust Through Life
Whomsoever told you that life is fair and smooth, lied to you. 
It may come as a shock to you, but today’s generation is all about fairness, which is a meaningless concept if you don’t attach some substantial weight to it.
So, we hate to say it, but you’d be better off if you understand the challenges that may come your way.

Scott Stratten, President of UnMarketing Inc., claims that this book is “the dictionary of business success language.”
Why should it not be?
When, instead of beating around the bush, Phil M. Jones is sharing with you no less than 23 magic words for influence and impact, and teaching you:
Who Should Read “Exactly What to Say”? And Why?
Ever since Dale Carnegie’s perennial classic
was published almost a century ago, numerous books have tried delving deeper into the matter, uncovering (and sharing with the world) so many tips and tricks on how to influence others.
Among them, Robert Cialdini’s 
is (perhaps justly) the most celebrated one, though Kurt Mortensen’s 
and McKintosh & Luecke’s 
have had their fair share of admirers as well.
Much more practical, 
is yet another book which falls in this category; and it’s worth every penny.
About Phil M. Jones

“The worst time to think about the thing you are going to say is in the moment you are saying it,” writes Phil M. Jones in the epigraph to 
.
And he makes things clear straight away: “This book prepares you for nearly every known eventuality and provides you with a fair advantage in almost every conversation.”
How is that possible?
Through the power of magic words!
Don’t know what they are?
Here’s a definition taken straight from the book:
So, in a nutshell:
• 
, there is undoubtedly some part in your skull which is inaccessible to consciousness and, which, nevertheless, influences your judgments, feelings, and behavior;
• This part is 
, guiding your routines, controlling your breathing while you sleep and even refocusing your attention whenever something akin to your name is mentioned;
• There are some words which communicate directly to this hidden – and governing – part of 
 human being;
• These are Jones’ magic words, “tried, tested and proven to deliver results when applied properly.”
But, enough with the theory.
Let’s see how this works in practice!

22. A Favor
23. Just Out of Curiosity
I’m Not Sure If It’s for You, But
“I’m not sure if it’s for you, but…” is the best way to introduce any idea to anyone.
Why?
Because, at a subconscious level, the listener translates it to “There’s no pressure here… Why don’t you have a look at this.”
• I’m not sure if it’s for you, but this option is available for this week only, and I would hate for you to miss out.
• I’m not sure if it’s for you, but we have plans on Sunday, and, if you’d like, you’re welcome to 
.
(Here and elsewhere below, almost all of the examples are taken straight from the book – possibly with some minor changes here and there.)
Open-Minded
As we said above, your subconscious works only along the lines of a “yes” and “no;” and since there’s no “maybe,” if you ask a group of 1,000 people whether they consider themselves open-minded, at least 90% of them would answer in the affirmative.
Why?
Because the alternative – “closed-minded” – sounds very, very bad.
Use this to your benefit – if you start a sentence with “how open-minded” you’re shifting the odds of your listener agreeing with you from 50/50 to 90/10.
• How open-minded would you be about trying this as an alternative?
• Would you be open-minded about seeing if we could work together?
What Do You Know?
All people think they know best – that’s how we’re built to think. And if you want to steer a conversation in a certain direction, you have to have control over it.
A great way to achieve this is by moving the other person’s position “from one of certainty to one of doubt.”
Hence the “what do you know?” magic phrase. And now you see why 
.
• What do you know about everything that has changed since (insert event)?
• What do you know about how things really work here?
How Would You Feel If?
We know for sure that people work a lot harder to avoid potential losses than to achieve a potential gain; simply put, nothing motivates us more than losing what we already own.
To overcome this obstacle – or, even better, to use it to your benefit – paint for your listener a future scenario so that you can trigger in him the proper emotions.
• How would you feel if your competition passed you? (
 
)
• How would you feel if this decision led to your promotion? (
)
Just Imagine
For better or for worse, we are 
; consequently, storytelling will always have the power to inspire, influence, and persuade.
Why?
Because it creates pictures in the minds of others and because we are wired to just sit back and enjoy the view in situations such as these.
When you were a child, the magic words were “Once upon a time…;” the adult formula is “Just imagine.”
• Just imagine how things will be in six months’ time once you have implemented this.
• Just imagine the look on your kids’ faces when they see you achieve this.
When Would Be a Good Time?
One of the biggest challenges of the 21
 century is finding the time – you for the others, the others for you.
However, unless you inspire someone to make a room in his life for your ideas, you’ll never sell your idea, will you?
A good way to do this is by using the phrase “when would be a good time?”
This magic expression implies that there 
 be some good time and incites the listener to tell you 
 will that time be.
• When would be a good time for you to take a proper look at this?
• When would be a good time to get started?
I’m Guessing You Haven’t Got Around To
This has probably happened to everyone at least once: someone promises that he/she will do something and yet he/she hasn’t after a certain period of time.
You know full well that you may ruin things if you’re aggressive, and yet you want to give the person of interest a nudge.
How should you do it?
By pushing for the negative scenario! 
It’s the other person’s turn to fix it.
• I’m guessing you haven’t got around to looking over the documents yet?
• I’m guessing you haven’t got around to making a decision yet?
Simple Swaps
Sometimes, just changing one or two words can make all the difference.
For example, swapping the slogan “I’m blind: would you give me some money?” with “It’s a sunny day, but I can’t see it…” has yielded more than positive results.
You do the same.
For example, instead of asking your audience “Do you have any questions?” ask them “What questions do you have for me?”
That way, you’re in control.
You Have Three Options
, we are notoriously susceptible to being fooled by both our emotions and our reason.
Also, we tend to suffer from something called analysis paralysis when we have to choose from a number of options.
A good way to take control over situations such as these is by offering only three options; afterward, just ask the other person “Of those three options, what’s going to be easier for you?”
That’s a magic word combo!
Two Types of People
If you want to prompt a near-instant decision, then frame the options within the “two types of people” narrative.
“The second someone hears, ‘There are two types of people in this world,’” writes Jones, “the little voice in their head immediately wonders which one they are, and they wait with bated breath to hear the choices.”
• There are two types of people in this world: those who leave their personal financial success in the hands of their employers and those who take full responsibility and build their own futures.
• There are two types of people in this world: those who resist change in favor of nostalgia and those who move with the times and create a better future.
I Bet You’re a Bit Like Me
The reason why you can’t convince strangers to do anything is that they are 
: we are evolutionarily preprogrammed not to trust people who are unlike us.
The tweak?
Just say “I bet you’re a bit like me” whenever you want to furnish a closer connection to the other person.
• I bet you’re a bit like me: you enjoy working hard now, knowing that it will pay dividends in the future.
• I bet you’re a bit like me: you’re a busy person who’s always juggling to get everything done.
If… Then
You remember the “if… then” sandwich from your childhood: 
“If you don’t tidy your room, then you’re going to be grounded for the weekend.”
Or, even more universal:
“If you don’t eat all your dinner, then you’re not going to get any dessert.”
It worked, didn’t it?
Well, now it’s your turn to act like your mother; ok, a bit like her.
• If you decide to give this a try, then I promise you won’t be disappointed.
• If you give me a chance in the role, then I am confident you will thank me later.
Don’t Worry
The best way to deal with a high-stress scenario?
Just convince the other person that nothing’s out of the order at the moment and that you have everything under control.
You need no more than two words to do this:
“Don’t worry.”
• Don’t worry. You’re bound to be nervous right now.
• Don’t worry. I felt just the way you feel right now before I started, and look at me now.
Most People
You know what most people are afraid of?
Being the outcasts, the recluses, the castaways; in a nutshell: being 
 most people.
That’s why you can get the attention of 
 people by simply telling them that what you need from them is precisely what most people would do.
Most people should follow.
• What most people do is complete the forms with me here today. You then receive your welcome pack, and we get you booked in for a launch.
• Most people in your circumstances would grab this opportunity with both hands, knowing that there is almost no risk.
The Good News
This one you know from practically every second film: even if the good news follows after the worst news, they always tend to bring some relief.
The formula is even more powerful if there is no bad news.
Everybody wants some positivity in his/her life, and “The good news is…” is the magic word to infuse it!
What Happens Next
Sometimes, no matter how hard you try, conversations may come to a halt due to the indecisiveness of your talking partner.
The thing to remember for situations such as this is simple: “the easier the question, the easier you gain your decision.”
So, make the next step by saying something along the lines of “What happens next is we’ll try to fill out your details; speaking of: In terms of registering your details, what is the best address for you?”
What Makes You Say That?
Sometimes – or, let’s face it: oftentimes – you’ll face not only indecisiveness but also objections and protests.
“I haven’t got the time now,” “I would, but I don’t have the money,” “I’m pretty sure your idea is great, but I’ve heard many better ideas,” etc.
The worst thing you could do in situations such as this is to respond with a counterargument; the best thing: be inquisitive.
• The customer says, “I need to speak to somebody else before I make a decision about this.” You say, “What makes you say that?”
• The customer says, “Really, I don’t have all the money right now.” You say, “What makes you say that?”
Before You Make Your Mind Up
Moving from a “no” to a “yes” is all but impossible; however, moving from a “no” to a “maybe” and from a “maybe” to a “yes” is conceivable.
The best way to make a step in the right direction concerning the first section of this two-part journey is by using the magic word “before you make your mind up.”
It inspires the other person to rethink his/her decision – and, in many cases, he/she will.
• Look, before you make your mind up, let’s make sure we’ve looked at all the facts.
• Before you make your mind up, wouldn’t it make sense to speak to a few more people about the difference this could make for you and your family?
If I Can, Will You?
Sometimes, the objections coming from the other side are a list of reasons why the thing you want to is unlikely to happen.
“You have the power in these situations,” says Jones, “to remove the barrier by responding with a powerful question that eliminates the other person’s argument.”
And that question is: “If I can… will you?”
• If I can pick you up and drop you off at home, then will you be able to be ready for seven pm?
• If I can match that price for you, then would you be happy to place the order with me today?
Enough
Influencing other people’s decision is all about making it easier for them to decide – of course, in a way which suits you best.
For example, if you are in a grocery store unable to choose between buying four or eight apples and the seller asks you “Would six apples be enough for you?” you’ll probably answer “yes” because of the presence of that 
.
Suddenly – four apples seem too few.
Just One More Thing
According to Phil M. Jones, the greatest negotiator he has ever met is the television detective Columbo, played by Peter Falk for many, many years.
His MO?
Just at the moment his suspect was relieved and sure that he had gotten away, Columbo would turn back to them and say, “Oh, just one more thing.”
Now that his suspect was more vulnerable than ever, Columbo could ask him/her the question that really mattered to him.
Introduce a Columbo moment to your pitch by inviting your client to an event at the moment of the transaction or asking them to sample a product.
As we’ve learned from Columbo – it works every time!
A Favor
Just like Phil M. Jones, we are also pretty sure that there have been many situations in your life when someone could do just a little something for you and make your life immediately easier.
Have you ever tried saying to him/her something along the lines “perhaps you could do me a small favor?”
The worst possible answer to that question is a conditional “yes,” aka “Depends what it is.”
Just Out of Curiosity
Sometimes, people say “no” – and are adamant in not changing their minds.
Do you:
a. give up?
b. try another magic word?
The correct answer, of course, is b, and the magic word is “just out of curiosity.” 
That phrase makes rude and obnoxious things sound soft and fluffy – and that’s exactly what you need if you want to become a professional mind-maker-upper.
• Just out of curiosity, what is it specifically you need some time to think about?
• Just out of curiosity, what is it that’s stopping you from moving forward with this right now?

And if you ask Brené Brown, the answer is as straightforward as answers can get:
A resounding “

Because, she says, “

For a very wrong reason.
Who Should Read “The Gifts of Imperfection”? And Why?
Let us ask you a question:
?
An imperfect but a happy human being, or a perfect one living a life burdened with anxieties?
When you think about it it’s not that bad to be the former, isn’t it?
You’ll find much more in Brené Brown’s “

“The Gifts of Imperfection PDF Summary”
Do you want to find out, lying on your deathbed, that you’ve lived your whole life the way you 
 want to?
If the answer is – as we should only expect – “no,” then it’s time for some 
changes.
Because, chances are, you’re currently living a “fake life,” one that’s designed for others much more than it is designed for yourself.
And if you want to change that, 
 
In “The Gifts of Imperfection,” Brené Brown provides you with ten guideposts on your road to embracing your imperfection and, with it, opening your heart for happiness and wholehearted living.
If you want to start living 
 life to the max, you must first separate your life from the lives of the others, that is, to quote Margaret Young, “you must first be who you really are, then do what you really need to do, in order to have what you want.”
In other words, you must be 
 and 
 
, because safety (
: more money, a successful career, and a picture-perfect partner – for the sake of them) is overrated.
Simply put, it may not describe your authentic self:
First of all, two things: perfectionism is 
 the same thing as striving to be your best, and it is 
 self-improvement.
So, what is it?
It is “a self-destructive and addictive belief system” which needs to be overcome.
Why?
Because there’s no such thing as perfection and because striving for it 
results in feeling some void which shouldn’t be there in the first place.
To overcome perfectionism, 


.
However, as we learned from Viktor Frankl’s “
,” possibly the most important among them, the very foundation of resilience, is 
, their belief into something bigger, and the ever-present light at the end of the tunnel.
However, 
 
 should always go hand in hand with 
Only that way, you can let go of numbing and powerlessness.


Being joyful doesn’t mean that you’re happy all the time.
It merely means that you’re grateful for the happy moments that you have.
Stop looking for more than you need.


Intuition is not irrational – it’s just 
.
In addition, “faith and reason are not natural enemies.”
It’s just that faith “is a place of mystery, where we find the courage to believe in what we cannot see and the strength to let go of our fear of uncertainty.”
And it’s good to be uncertain from time to time.
It’s the very essence of adventure.


Comparison, writes Brown, is “all about conformity and competition.”
In her dictionary, these are not mutually exclusive, but incremental: comparison has the twofold meaning of first fitting in and then standing out!
Creativity, on the other hand, is the expression of authenticity; and it’s the nemesis of comparison.
The great part?
Without comparison, “concepts like 
 or 
 or 
 or 
 lose their meaning.”


The last time we checked, dying of exhaustion is something that actually happens in this world.
So often, in fact, that the Japanese – who else? – even have a word for it now: 
, i.e., “overwork death.”
Is that the world you like to live in?
Just stop fearing that you’ll miss out on something.
Instead: get some rest and play a game or two with your children.
You’ll feel great afterward!


Remember your teachers screaming “Calm down!” or “Sit still!”?
It turns out – these are pretty great advices.
They just communicated them the wrong way.
Which is 
 the point.


Unless it’s dying or paying taxes, you’re actually not 
 do anything!
So why should you feel self-doubt, fear, and anxiety because of all these “supposed-to-dos”?
Just don’t!
Kennedy was wrong. Howard Thurman was right:
We don’t know who 
 said it first (Brown says it’s Twain), but whoever it was, he or she was more than right: “Dance like no one is watching. Sing like no one is listening. Love like you’ve never been hurt and live like it’s heaven on Earth.”
If what’s stopping you from doing these things is the fear of being uncool – then you’re missing out on your life for the 
 reason imaginable.
Because you know what’s the coolest thing ever?

Have you ever wondered why some people grow big while others just stop growing? If yes, then “ 
” book is for you.
The author 
, is known as a motivational writer and a leadership development coach who published his first bestseller “The Magic of Thinking Big” in 1959. He simply and clearly explained in this book step by step 
and it all comes down to our way of thinking.
There are 13 chapters in David J. Schwartz’s book – “
“, each chapter gives you practical information and HOW-TO’s.
By the end of this book, you would come to realize that the man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can’t, both are actually right. 
The line above is, in fact, the title of the first chapter and in this chapter, you will find out exactly how you can develop
You have to think big and believe in your ability to succeed in order to live big in happiness, big in accomplishment, big in income, big in friends, big in respect.
“The Magic of Thinking Big PDF Summary”
Excusitis is a disease born from covertness or wrong choices. At first, you may know that you are just lying to yourself. But a lie repeated over and over becomes an inner truth.
In the end, you are one with your own lie and strongly believe that this defines you. Finally, you may conclude that the success is just a fairy tale written for somebody else.
And, the sad part is that the human brain seems to be built to create excuses. And the common forms of excuses are:
However, to achieve big dreams, thinking big is just not enough you have to cure yourself of excuses, the failure disease. The second and the third chapter will help you to identify and get rid of all the excuses that hold you back and prevent you from executing on your big ideas.
Our desire to be successful will be fulfilled only if we think big, express ourselves fearlessly, find a meaningful work in which we can win admiration, inspire and get inspired, contribute to our community and being looked up to by people in business and social life.
When you are a big thinker and a strong believer; you will never sell yourself short, you would use words and speak in such a way that 
.
They would place their utmost confidence in you, opportunities will come to you because they believe in you and your ability to accomplish big things and get the desired results.
In this chapter, you would learn how to strengthen your creativity, how to develop your ideas and how the ideas of others help to spark your own ideas so your mind is more creative.
David J. Schwartz believes that capacity is a state of mind, how much you can do depends on how much you think you can do. Find creative ways to do more and add more because that is how you progress.
How you think determines how you act and how you act in turn determines how others react to you. You receive the kind of treatment that you think you deserve. People who demand the most respect also are the most successful.
Our environment has a strong effect on us, that’s why it’s important to surround ourselves with like-minded people; people who encourage and support us on 
. “Select friends who are interested in positive things, friends who really do want to see you succeed.
Find friends who breathe encouragement into your plans and ideals. If you don’t, if you select petty thinkers as your close friends, you’ll gradually develop into a petty thinker yourself.”
On your journey to create the life you want, 
 and associate yourself with the dreamers. “When you face a difficult situation, think, “I’ll win,” not “I’ll probably lose.” When you compete with someone else, think, “I’m equal to the best,” not I’m outclassed.
When an opportunity appears, think “I can do it,” never “I can’t.” Let the master thought “I will succeed” dominate your thinking process.
Thinking success conditions your mind to create plans that produce success. Thinking failure does the exact opposite. Failure thinking conditions the mind to think other thoughts that produce failure.

We are tempted to blame ourselves for not knowing exactly what we were “programmed” to do in life for a living. It seems that we pass through all the key moments, decisive ones, without paying enough attention to where we fit best.
To which field we belong. And we wake up one day asking ourselves:
At first sight, this question may seem simple. Easy. But the answer is a long-term key to our future’s door.
 is one of the authors that challenge our mindset on work and life itself, increasing our awareness via his ardent tone.
“The Art of Work Summary”
You are either brave enough to listen to what life wants to tell you, hear the calling, pay attention to the hints as they avail before us and succeed in this economy or miss the clear signs. 
:
A Proven Path to Discovering What You Were Meant to Do reveals the 
 needed to discover your true vocation via real case studies.
They serve as an inspiration and make you aware of your life’s work. And more than that: the purpose behind it and the opportunities that appear in our life. By this he makes you realize how important it is not to miss them.
He has clear views on work and its true purpose, mastery-doing your absolute 
. The journey starts with awareness, and it ends with an overview of how your legacy looks like, all structured in 3 parts:
Usually, we are blaming ourselves for not having already born with a clear calling in our minds.
Is the calling just a natural fact that appears suddenly?
Discovering your calling is not a destination. It’s more about the trip, the adventure. About the trains, you choose to jump in or not.
Discovering your calling is not an epiphany but a series of intentional decisions.
To find out which is your calling it takes time. Usually the entire time of your life.
Jeff Goins provides 7 stages to finding your life’s work that serves as a model to us:
According to Jeff Goins, 
. Our job is to realize that life is more than what beats the eye and there are clear hints along the path of discovering our true self.
It is not an easy road, we have to be willing to step out of the box and see the bigger picture and start acting.
Jeff Goins introduces this concept by describing what apprenticeship meant in the Middle Ages, and how it has changed throughout centuries.
In the past, apprenticeship meant working with a mentor for several years and 
. Nowadays that situation is completely different and the individual is left by himself to find his calling.
. You may find it in different stages from your life, and they can help you find your calling, simply by serving as a model, or by giving you an advice at the right place and at the right moment.
Practice is significant in our journey as:
The author, Jeff Goins is not afraid to say that by practicing you will find what you want to do in life. If you failed at something, it means that you were not meant for that type of activity.
The journey continues with discovery.
In order to discover our vocation, we need to keep in mind that it may take longer than we first assumed. But that does not mean that it will not happen. So be sure to take the hints that life presents and seize every opportunity as if you will not come across it twice.
A profession is seen as the result of different tries that we achieve after a

True mastery means 
 of what others think is possible or even sensible.
Those stages are concluded with Legacy.
These views on work and life itself are quite practical in our daily lives.
He is not only providing the steps that we need to follow to achieve our life’s work. He also gives us other 7 signs that will tell us whether we found our calling or not.
You have found your own calling if it’s something really familiar to you, you are very good at it, and other people recognize this in you.
It has to be challenging. If the task is challenging, and you keep doing it, then it is more than a hobby, it’s your calling
How challenging is your work?
If it takes time and you need to overcome obstacles in order to achieve it, it‘s definitely your vocation.
After 
 you realize that it wouldn’t have been possible without the help of your community and mentors.
Do you know who your mentors are? Think about it.
All in all, 
 that I highly recommend not only because of the practical information presented but also because of Jeff’s honest and inspiring writing style.

Plot
Since we firmly believe that you’ll enjoy much better our plot summary if you can check who is who at every single moment of the story, once again, we provide you with a comprehensive genealogy table of the main characters in the story which lies behind 
.
So, whenever a name sounds unfamiliar – or, better yet, familiar but you’re having problems placing it in the story – just go back to here, and you’ll be able to orient yourself in the story in no time!
The Third Miscarriage
In the very first paragraph of 
we are informed that one-fifth of women miscarry and that 80 percent of these lose the baby in the first three months of their pregnancy. 
“If you are more than thirty years old,” goes on the narrator, “you have at least 12 percent chance of miscarrying, the percentage points increasing with each passing year.”
How does the narrator know all of this and why is any of this important to her?
You’ve guessed it: she has had a miscarriage herself; in fact, two of them; and she’s telling us all of these facts while not working in her office and holding a sonogram picture between her fingers:
Unfortunately, the narrator of our story,
, seems preordained to be one of the latter.
Just a few moments after we hear the above, her husband 
, “a born litigator,” calls her; and before too long, we learn that Jaya is bleeding.
She’s gone through this one too many times in the past to have any doubts about what is happening to her.
In the summer of 2000, Jaya miscarries.
For the third time. 
A Trip to India
Jaya is incapable of coping with her loss; and Patrick seems incapable of coping with Jaya’s inability to cope with it; and, what’s more, he wanted a child as well.
Things pan out in the worst way imaginable: he leaves her; just at the time when she needs him the most.
Devasted by the double loss, Jaya starts suffering from sporadic blackouts. To make matters worse, she has nobody to console her, mostly because her relationship with her mother 
 is bereaved of any emotions; the two have been distant from each other ever since Jaya remembers. 
You thought that was all when it comes to bad news?
Guess again: Jaya learns that her grandfather Deepak – Lena’s father – is at his deathbed nearing the end of his journey on earth. 
His only wish?
To see his children: his sons and his estranged daughter.
However, nobody wants to grant him that – not even Lena.
Jaya asks her mother why and she tells her – cryptically – that her banishment was her punishment for being born.
Of course, the first thing you do when you hear something like that from a closed one – and you know this from practically every movie ever made – is you investigate.
So, against her mother’s wishes, Jaya leaves England and goes back to the country of her ancestors, India.
There, at her mother’s former home, she happens upon a guy named 
.
He reveals to Jaya that Deepak died just two days before her arrival; and that he is not exactly the man he thinks he is.
Neither is, well, just about everyone from her family.
Time for a very long flashback.
Amisha and Deepak
Ravi, we learn, was the servant of Jaya’s grandmother 
; and, more or less, Amisha is the main protagonist in not only his but also in Sejal Badani’s story.
In accordance with old Indian laws, Amisha was given in marriage to a young local boy named Deepak – when she was barely a teenager. As was customary, after she moved in with Deepak’s family, all her connections with her birth family were severed: now she was a member of her husband’s household.
On their wedding night, both Amisha and Deepak are nervous – and we don’t need to tell you the reason for that.
However, as much as Amisha is nervous because of innocent reasons, Deepak feels that way because, well, he’s going to get laid for the first time. 
Amisha notices his uneasiness and starts telling him a story so that she can decrease his stress and relax him; Amisha is a natural storyteller and, in a way, her plot works.
But, make no mistake: it’s not like Deepak cares for Amisha’s story or anything; it’s not like he cares for her, as a matter of fact; to him, Amisha is merely a 
: she is just a woman, the woman who’ll bear his children and wash the dishes.
And, you know what? 
Amisha is supposed to be happy about all of this!
At least that’s what 
, Deepak’s mother, tells her: their family is well-regarded in the village, she says, and, let’s face it, that’s the most a woman can (and should) hope about.
Eventually, Amisha hires a servant: Ravi. 
The problem?
Ravi is untouchable, member of the lowest caste.
Fortunately, despite Chara’s protests, Deepak allows him to stay; Ravi remains eternally grateful and loves Amisha more than anything in the world.
Learning English
Years pass and 
 sets up an English school in Amisha’s village.
Amisha, hopeful that she could be able to write her stories in English one day in the future, meets with the head of the school, a British officer named Stephen.
Stephen notices her desire and convinces her to start going to school; Amisha, however, too afraid of Deepak’s reaction, quits after a single day.
Stephen would not have it: she goes over to her house and offers Amisha to become her personal tutor in English; in return, she would only need to teach the children at the local school creative writing.
Ravi convinces Amisha to accept; she does.
In Amisha proves to be a great teacher; she is especially adored by a teenage girl named 
, who is the most talented in her class; unsurprisingly, Amisha is reminded of herself every time she sets her eyes upon Neema.
And every time she sets her eyes upon Stephen, she starts feeling some tingling in the area around her heart.
As the two grow closer and closer, it becomes rather obvious that Stephen feels much the same way about her.
One day, Amisha gifts Stephen a story about two brothers meeting each other in Heaven; Stephen is touched: his own brother had died in the war, and he’s more than aware that this story was written specifically with him in mind.
Amisha, in the meantime, realizes that a story by Neema is highly personal as well.
In it, a girl kills herself to avoid being forced into an arranged marriage; Amisha correctly deduces that Neema’s hand is already promised and that she doesn’t want to accept the inevitability of her fate.
Love… and Everything That Comes With It
One day, while preparing the house for the inevitable hurricane, Ravi injures himself; however, since he’s untouchable, no doctor in the city wants to have anything to do with his injury.
Amisha, seeing no way out, runs to Stephen’s house; Stephen takes Ravi to a military base where he is treated for his injury.
Stephen comes back from the base and reveals to Amisha that Ravi is fine; overcome with emotions, Amisha jumps in his arms and kisses him; Stephen returns the kiss; the third kiss is deep and passionate.
Nothing further happens, since Amisha is told in the meantime that one of her students tried to kill herself.
You get zero points for guessing that the student is none other than Neema; Amisha was right: inspired by her classes, Neema started feeling that the choice between death and loveless marriage is not as difficult as it may seem to some.
After the story of Neema makes the rounds and reaches the ears of Deepak, he forbids Amisha to ever return to school.
It’s a double blow for Amisha since this also spells the end of her meetings and discussions with Stephen; Ravi helps in relation to the latter: as soon as he recovers, he acts as a messenger between the two
One day, Amisha learns that Stephen has been reassigned to another post, away not only from her hometown but also from India. 
Distraught, she ignores all prohibitions and risks, and goes over to Stephen; the two finally make love.
Yup, that’s when Lena was conceived; Jaya’s grandfather was never called Deepak.
The Storyteller’s Secret Epilogue
Lena’s real grandfather never got to know her: Stephen left India in the meantime, and, a few years later, Amisha died, the victim of a fatal tropic disease contracted from a mosquito bite.
Deepak remarried, and his new wife Omi didn’t like Lena one bit; especially not after finding Amisha’s love letters to Stephen.
The result?
Deepak fires Ravi for allowing the affair to happen and starts neglecting Lena; no wonder she started neglecting her daughter as well: she was never loved enough to learn how to love.
Back in the present, Ravi reveals to Lena that the secret of Amisha’s relationship wasn’t the only one she kept throughout the years.
There’s an even bigger one, he says.
Namely, Stephen came back for Amisha, stubbornly determined to take her with him and never look back; however, Ravi stopped him, telling him that it’s for the best of both of them that things stay the way they are.
Jaya forgives Ravi: we’ll never know if he made the right decision, but we’ll always know that he did it with the best of intentions.
Soon after, Jaya gets a phone call; it’s none other than Patrick, telling her that he loves her and that he has made a mistake. 
Want proof?
He’s in India, looking for her.
The two settle their differences and decide to adopt children; there are hints that these children may be Ravi’s: 
 and 
.
Ravi allows them to travel to London with Patrick and Jaya so that Misha can get polio treatment, something he’s unable to in India.
Soon after the four leave, Amisha’s spirit appears to Ravi.
“You did a good job,” it says. “Now, it’s time to take some rest.”
Ravi passes away.

Steve Jobs PDF Summary,https://blog.12min.com/steve-jobs-summary-biography-walter-isaacson/,,"13 min read ⌚ 
Steve Jobs is not a name. It is almost a noun as “apple”. Or “computer”. Or “
“. Or whatever noun you may be thinking of. You heard it a thousand times and you think you know what it really means without a preliminary lesson. And as every respectable noun, he arouses curiosity: what are his roots? When was he the subject or when was he only a direct complement?
BIOGRAPHY/ STEVE JOBS
Understanding and communicating the life of Steve Jobs is a challenge. Making the Steve Jobs summary wasn’t any easier. Steve was such a genius that he chose a biographer to the height.
After the cancer diagnosis which eventually led to his death, Walter Isaacson was the chosen biographer.
“Steve Jobs Summary”
He already had in his portfolio no less than biographies of Albert Einstein and Benjamin Franklin, and to fulfil the mission, he interviewed Steve on more than 40 occasions for 2 years, as well as more than 100 friends, relatives, competitors, and co-workers.
Jobs biography is a collection of fantastic stories, through the ups and downs of his career, his passion and perfectionism and the revolution of six major industries: personal computing, animation cinema, music, e-books, mobile phones, and tablets.
Jobs was an inventive genius who knew that the 21st century was based on connecting technology and creativity. Steve cooperated with the book, but he did not interfere in any way. In fact, he did not even read the book before its publication and encouraged all interviewees to be sincere and transparent.
His story, captured succinctly in this summary, is a fantastic tale of innovation, character, 
, and values.
Zen, Critic, and ill-behaved
Those who knew Steve Jobs as a child may not have imagined that he would reach the top of the business world by founding and leading the most valuable company in the world.
Born in February 1955, the son of a 
 father named Abdulfattah and a Catholic mother named Joanne, he was put up for donation because his father did not share his mother’s Catholic religion.
He was adopted by Paul, an engineer who worked as a mechanic and Clara Jobs. Living in Silicon Valley, a rich environment for technology experiments, Steve was introduced to the world of engineering and design by his own adoptive father.
Despite being welcomed by his parents, he fought throughout his life against feelings of abandonment. The Steve boy was extremely precocious, impertinent and intelligent. Proof of his daring is that when he was 13, he phoned Bill Hewlett, Hewlett-Packard’s president to order electronic components for a school project.
Working with his father, he learned to be proud of his work and to be thorough.
From childhood, he had already demanded the perfection of himself and the people around him. As a teenager, Jobs became interested in the computer world and the 
 that spilt over into the Valley at that time.
Steve experimented with drugs like LSD and other psychedelics, and later he would attribute 
 to these drugs. For Steve, his experiences with LSD helped him to understand what mattered in life and to see other perspectives on the world.
In addition to his interest in altered consciousness, Steve was also interested in spirituality. He walked barefoot and rarely bathed and followed his growing interest in spiritual philosophies spending seven months in India, where he learned more about intuition and introspection.
At first, he embraced the possibilities of computing, much more for his potential to raise human consciousness than for his business or commercial applications. But the Zen influences failed to soften his increasingly 
.
One Apple day
Steve Wozniak was a timid electronic nerd who shared with Steve the taste for Bob Dylan’s classics. They invented a device called the “Blue Box” that mimicked the wrists of a telephone line and allowed people to hack into the telephone system, making free calls.
 was superior to Jobs technically, but Jobs had the determination and the spirit to market the products. Woz invented and Jobs sold.
After visiting a farm, Jobs imagined that “Apple” was a gentle and simple name. With only $ 1,300 in 1976, 
. In Jobs’s garage, he and Woz worked together and created the Apple, their first personal computer and their second version, the Apple II.
The Apple I consisted of a case with a built-in keyboard that plugged into a TV and software that would allow the end consumer to operate a computer. With this, they managed to take the computing from the world of nerds to put it in the house of people.
Wozniak developed the circuit boards as Jobs linked computing power to a friendly packaging that represented his obsession with perfection. In just 30 days being marketed, the Apple I was already becoming profitable. For the Apple II, the project was more audacious and perfectionist.
But Steve was rude and rude to his employees. He seemed not to 
 and focused only on the details of the product itself.
Given his imbalances and emotional instabilities, Mike Scott was appointed the president of Apple Computer, and eventually, there were conflicts between employees and Jobs, who had to be mediated by Scott.
Steve’s obsession was so great that he came to reject more than 2,000 shades of beige for the Apple II box and Scott had to decide at the end. Steve also insisted on offering a one-year consumer warranty when the industry standard was 90 days.
When his colleagues confronted him, Jobs screamed, spoke and sometimes even cried, but he always got what he wanted. His closest collaborators learned how to deal with him, but he was a master of manipulation, always trying to do everything his way.
But the company was doing so well that this situation ended up being tolerated internally.
The Apple II has sold 6 million copies and is considered one of the cornerstones of personal computing. For Steve, that was not enough. He wanted to build a computer that would leave a mark on the universe.
So Jobs began working on the Macintosh, the successor to the Apple II that would lead him to stardom.
The impetus for further action prompted Jobs to assemble a renegade team of “pirates” inside the company to compete internally with the Apple team that was building the computer Lisa (named after the illegitimate daughter Jobs first was reluctant to acknowledge, but later welcomed).
The Macintosh was not a unique creation of Jobs, in fact, 
) from others, but the project gave life to a machine that was powerful enough to display sophisticated graphics and be controlled by a mouse.
The Macintosh was an absolute success especially due to the TV campaign of the commercial called “1984”, directed by famous Hollywood director Ridley Scott. The commercial was so successful that sales exploded and everyone came to know Steve Jobs.
He got interviews in every major magazine manipulating journalists as if he were giving them an exclusive.The Macintosh made Steve rich and famous, but his personality was eroding the company.
His oppressive and perfectionist behaviour was making the employees feel disenchanted and depressed. This behaviour caused his dismissal from Apple by its board in 1985.
What’s next?
After recovering from his resignation from his own company, Jobs noticed that he could now do things his own way. His first project was a computer for the educational market called NeXT. With Next, he resumed his passion for design.
He invested more than $ 100,000 just for the company logo and wanted the computer to be in the form of a perfect cube, but that made manufacturing costs too expensive.
The NeXT almost broke, the launch was delayed in years and in the end, the product was too expensive for the consumer. Its high cost and the lack of availability of software caused the project to fail.
At the same time, Jobs bought control of a company called Pixar. As chairman of the board, he created a strategy that combined technology and art. In 1988, Jobs had already lost tens of millions at Next and invested $ 50 million in Pixar.
Pixar released a movie called “Tin Toy” that won the award for best animation and this made Jobs shift its focus to the animated film business. Eventually, Pixar partnered with Disney and released their first movie, Toy Story, which became the most profitable film of the year 1996.
Pixar made an IPO, and Steve’s stock was then valued at $ 1.2 billion.
Steve in family
In addition to his new business, Jobs tried to reconcile his personal life, reconnecting with his biological family.
In 1986 after the death of his adoptive mother, he met his biological mother. He was surprised to learn that she had a sister who was artistic and temperamental and they became close.
At the same time, he met his future wife, Laurene Powell, with whom he married in 1991. The couple had two children, Erin and Eve. With Laurene’s encouragement, Jobs also spent more time with his daughter Lisa, who was as temperamental as Jobs.
In some cases, they would remain months without speaking. In private as well as in his professional life, Jobs was either very passionate or extremely distant.
A new Apple
After Jobs left, Apple fell into decline. In 1996 Gil Amelio 
, and he wanted to bring new ideas to restore the company. In 1997, he bought Next and made Jobs an advisor to Apple. Once back at Apple, Steve took as much control as he could. He put his favourite NeXT employees in the highest positions at Apple.
The company was not doing well, and the board decided to give Jobs a new chance as CEO. But Jobs declined the invitation.
He preferred to retain his advisor status to gain more influence in the company. He managed 
 to develop Office for Mac and thus ended the battle between companies.
The stock price of Apple took off, and after some time, he finally accepted the invitation to become CEO of the company again. By taking over, his focus became unique. Focus the company on making fewer products. And so he worked to save Apple. The mantra of his administration was “Focus.”
He rejected entire product lines, fired irrelevant employees and cut the whole stockpiles. Jobs had transformed himself from a free-spirited corporate rebel to a uniquely dedicated, collaborative yet volatile executive.
He believed in “deep collaboration” between departments and in engaging and cultivating “A-players”, high-level talents.
Thus, a potential marketing engagement had to be hounded by designers and software engineers. “Simultaneous Engineering” meant that the products under development went through simultaneous reviews of manufacturing, design, marketing, and distribution, rather than going through each area sequentially.
This ensured that everyone had a stake in the development and creation of new products. Jobs hired Tim Cook to run operations, and the two connected and quickly became friends. Cook would eventually help Jobs lead Apple.
The strategy worked: Apple, which was 90 days from insolvency, turned a loss of $ 1 billion in 1997 to a profit of $ 309 million a year later.
The field of reality distortion
Jobs had a strange ability to persuade people 
. He demanded what others considered impossible. Thus, glimpsing the impossible, he made things happen and changed reality.
He focused so intensely on what interested him that he sometimes ignored everything else, including his wife, Laureen, their children – Reed, Erin and Eve, Lisa – and their family and friends. Steve was cruel and extremely critical of others and his work, but even so, 
.
He never clung to material possessions, living in unfurnished homes, but his passion for products made Apple a giant.
Jobs believed that the rules did not apply to him. The man who refused to put plates in his cars and parked in places reserved for disabled people invented products that consumers did not even know they wanted but for which they soon fell in love.
Design in all the aspects
Steve Jobs learned the importance of design quality with his father who taught him how to make beautiful the hidden sides of a cabinet mattered as much as creating an elegant front. From his forays into the Eastern philosophies, Jobs understood that product design was at its core.
He met a designer named Jony Ive, who became his right-hand man and # 2 at Apple.
Mr Jobs elevated these concepts to the point where he believed the presentation of Apple products could convey as much meaning as the products themselves. Even packaging was crucial. Jobs got so involved in the design minutiae that his name appears on several patents of Apple products.
 of the public when Apple introduced the iMac in 1998. Quickly the computer developed along with Jony Ive became the computer that sold fastest in history.
The round, fun-looking computer came with a semi-transparent coating and was available in five colours. Jobs made the interior as attractive as the exterior.
When Apple extended the range of colours, Microsoft’s Bill Gates painted his PC in red and mocked that the iMac would be a fad.
In addition to the obsession with design, Jobs wanted to control the entire distribution chain. Hence came the idea of having your own physical presence, the Apple Store. The first Apple Store came in 2001 and was a great success.
Today, Apple Stores are still the result of the almost 
 of Jobs. Computers were different, but retailers generally did not focus on explaining differences to buyers. Jobs wanted to manage the consumer experience, just as he had influenced all other aspects of computer design and production.
Therefore, he resolved to design sales points with the same taste he brought for everything else. He insisted on expensive and busy places. He patented the design of the titanium and glass staircases of the stores. He wanted more than a store.
He wanted a customer experience that was associated with the spirit of Apple products.
More than just computers
Jobs took the “Top 100” employees (the ones he would choose to put on a “lifeboat and take to his next company”) at an annual retreat to discuss Apple’s future. In 2000, the company’s transformation began.
The personal computer evolved into a digital cube that could manage the consumer’s digital lifestyle, from written communications to cameras, music players, and video recording.
Apple removed the word “Computers” from its corporate name to explore the potential of the internet to connect and integrate these different aspects. For example, iTunes grew out of Jobs’s perception that downloading music over the internet would change the music industry: the iTunes store sold a million songs in the first six days.
The iPod resulted from the need for a better music 
, the scroll wheel is included. The success of the iPod, built on the sales of the iMac, consolidated the brand. In January 2007, the iPod accounted for half of Apple’s revenue.
Still, Jobs kept looking for the next big release. Identifying cell phone as the next wave, he left a new mark on the universe and unveiled the iPhone, combining iPod, telephony and internet access. It alone accounted for more than 50% of total global cellphone profits in the year 2010.
The idea of a tablet predated the iPhone, but in 2010 experiments with the iPhone paved the way for the next revolutionary item: the iPad. In the case of the iPad, Apple sold 1 million units in the first month and reached 15 million in just 9 months.
Battling cancer
Jobs believed that his cancer, diagnosed in 2003, 
 he experienced when he led Apple and Pixar in the late 1990s. Treatment for kidney stones led to an examination that discovered his cancer.
Even so, the prognosis was good; the tumour was treatable and slow-growing. However, Jobs rejected medical recommendations for surgery. He consulted nutritionists, acupuncturists, followed vegetarian diets, underwent colon cleanings and banished negativity from his thoughts.
In 2005, he made mention of his mortality in a graduation speech at Stanford University. Jobs told the trainees, “Remembering that I will be dead soon is the most important tool I have found to help me 
 … There is no reason not to follow your heart.”

Final Notes
Steve Jobs has transformed industries, invented new forms of communication, put the world at your fingertips, and made it fun, intelligent and cool. His belief that the product was everything guided Apple’s philosophy and its focus on how the consumer would perceive and use those products.
Jobs felt, just like his idol Edwin Lan of Polaroid, that he was in the “intersection of the arts with science.” Like Walt Disney, Jobs wanted to leave a company that contributed to society and represented more than just profits.
He recognized that his personality was difficult and that his behaviour was sometimes cruel but believed that being honest was the only way to give his best and extract the best from those around him.

You know everything there’s to know about evolution, right?
The fittest survive and so on and so forth.
Well, Richard O. Prum would like a chance to change your mind with a new theory, one aptly titled:
.
Who Should Read “The Evolution of Beauty”? And Why?
The obvious answer is biologists, social biologists, and ornithologists.
However, we think that this is a book that should interest everyone who likes to reread Darwin with fresher eyes.
Or Dawkins.

After receiving a BA at Harvard in 1983, Prum went on to obtain a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan six years later.
His field of specialty is the evolution of feathers, and his main interests include phylogenetics and sexual selection.
 is his only book so far.
“The Evolution of Beauty PDF Summary”
Darwin’s Biggest Problem
Darwin’s theory of evolution is, quite possibly, 
.
In fact, when back in 2012, Edge.org, the world’s smartest website, 
 the world of science “what is your favorite deep, elegant, or beautiful explanation?” most of the intellectuals surveyed answered something along the lines: “of course it’s Darwin’s theory of evolution, but I suppose everyone will say that, so I’m going with…”
Consequently, Darwin’s theory of evolution is a theory which needs no introduction, and which, by Darwin’s own admission from 
, can be summed up in a single phrase of Herbert Spencer: “the survival of the fittest.”
Most of the biologists living today would certainly agree with it; after all, why shouldn’t they: it’s a nice, neat theory which seems to explain the complexity of the world in such an economical manner that it’s difficult to find any flaws with it.
And yet, Darwin himself found a big, almost gaping hole in it: if the biological point of life is to be fit enough so that you can leave some offspring, then why should so many animals be so brightly colored and feature traits which instead of helping them survive, make them more vulnerable?
“The sight of a feather in a peacock’s tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!” – grappling with this problem, 
.
Why should such a beautiful thing as a peacock’s tail make anyone sick?
“Because,” writes Richard Prum, “the extravagance of its design seemed of no survival value whatsoever; unlike other heritable features that are the result of natural selection, the peacock’s tail seemed to challenge everything that [Darwin] had said in 
.”
Darwin’s Beautiful Solution
So, twelve years later, in his second-most famous book, 
, Darwin tried to solve this problem, the problem of impracticable beauty.
“In this book,” writes Richard Prum, Darwin “proposed a second, independent mechanism of evolution – sexual selection – to account for armaments and ornaments, battle and beauty. If the results of natural selection were determined by the differential survival of heritable variations, then the results of sexual selection were determined by their differential sexual success – that is, by those heritable features that contribute to success at obtaining mates.”
Put plainly, sometimes it’s not the fittest, but it’s the most beautiful that survive.
This would explain not only the peacock’s lavish tail, but also the elaborate feathers, exquisite songs, and mating dances of numerous other birds; it should also explain the white backside and legs of the Malaysian Banteng bull; it explains the red buttocks of many monkeys and apes as well.
Darwin proposed that within this second dynamic force of evolution – sexual selection – two distinct and sometimes opposing mechanisms are at work:
• 
, or “the struggle between individuals of one sex – often male – for sexual control over the individuals of the other sex;” according to Darwin, the battle for sexual control was the main reason why some weapons of aggression (such as horns, antlers, and spurs) and large bodies appeared and evolved.
• 
 
, or “the process by which the members of one sex – often female – choose their mates on the basis of their own innate preferences;” it’s Nature giving its species a second chance: you better be beautiful if you have no brains or brawn.
The law of the battle explains the evolution of armament; the taste for the beautiful – the evolution of ornament.
The Rejection of Darwin’s Theory
Unless you’re an expert in Darwin, the section above should probably come as a surprise to you (we sure found it quite surprising).
Its full implications: natural selection is 
 the only driving force behind evolution; as impractical as it has become in the eyes of many precisely because of Darwin’s theory, beauty may be an even more important factor in speciation and survival.
How did it happen that we forget this?
Well, blame it on two Victorians and a bunch of Neo-Darwinists, writes Prum.
The first one among these is St. George Mivart, an English biologist and an ardent believer in natural selection for the fifteen or so years following the publication of the 
.
Mivart had problems specifically with the taste-for-the-beautiful mechanism mostly because, unlike natural selection, this one presupposed “choice, exercised freely.”
Also, because he lived at a day and age when it was fashionable to be misogynist: “such is the instability of vicious feminine caprice
” Mivart wrote in a review of 
 “that no constancy of coloration could be produced by its selective actions.”
The other one to challenge Darwin’s belief in the second evolutionary force – “sexual selection” and “mate choice” – was none other than Alfred Russel Wallace, a man largely forgotten by history though he devised the theory of evolution concurrently with Darwin.
“The only way in which we can account for the observed facts,” wrote Wallace in his 1878 book, 
, “is by supposing that color and ornament are strictly correlated with health, vigor, and general fitness to survive.”
And this view prevailed.
Most of the Neo-Darwinists today believe that the flashiness of a peacock’s tail speaks volumes of its fitness: 
”
There’s more to it, says Prum.
Richard O. Prum to the Rescue
An “obsessive birder,” Richard O. Prum has studied the world of birds for over four decades, and so far has personally seen (and, in many cases, thoroughly examined) about a third of the world’s ten thousand known bird species.
His view?
As far as birds are concerned, “aesthetic evolution has great explanatory power” – in fact, much greater than the power of the “fitness first” model; rereading Darwin once again, he suggests, and accepting his more complicated evolutionary theory “rescues us from the tedious and limiting adaptationist insistence on the ubiquitous power of natural selection.”
Prum writes:
In other words, humans don’t find symmetrical faces beautiful because they suggest great fitness; they find them beautiful because beauty is an important factor in evolution as well.
Now, how did that happen?
Because (since we don’t know the point of it all) it is inevitable that, at one point, natural selection should make way for sexual selection.
Wallace and Mivart thought that most of the species – in fact, all, excepting humans – are simply not that smart to make aesthetic choices.
The point is: they needn’t be; either way, aesthetic evolution will happen.
Let’s explain this a little bit more.
Remembering the Genius of Ronald Fisher
First of all, as Prum himself indicates, this is far from a new idea.
In fact, the mathematical biologist Ronald Fisher, “the greatest of Darwin’s successors,” proposed quite a few theories that explain the lavishness of the peacock’s tale, as well as sexual attractiveness as an evolutionary factor a century ago.
The most interesting among these are certainly 
 and 
. 
According to 
(a theory which wins our vote for the best-named scientific theory in history), a female’s ideal choice for a male partner is one whose genes should produce a male offspring with the best chances for reproductive success.
The result – 
 – “is that one of the most desirable qualities a male can have in the eyes of a female is, quite simply, sexual attractiveness itself.”
Sounds a bit tautological, but it makes sense:
Brad Pitt is not healthier than most males; he’s just more beautiful than them and a guarantor that his children will also be beautiful enough to have children themselves.
And this makes even more sense if you add the second of Fisher’s many theories: the Fisherian runaway, basically the foundational block of Prum’s book.
According to Fisher, both Wallace and Darwin were right, but in relation to different phases of evolution.
Namely, originally females preferred male traits which were “honest and accurate indices of health, vigor, and survival ability.”
In other words, the first generation of peacock’s with more ornamental tails was necessarily healthier and more fit for survival than those whose tails were ordinary; consequently, these were the ones who survived.
But this is where it gets interesting: with them, the genes contributing to ornamentation survived as well.
Ready for another tautology?
Now precisely because of the fact that these birds were the chosen ones, their genes evolved to make their tails even more ornamental so that their male offspring be the chosen ones as well!
In other words, “the very existence of mate choice would 
 the display trait from its original honest, quality information by creating a new, unpredictable, aesthetically driven evolutionary force: sexual attraction to the trait itself”:
“Once the trait is attractive,” writes Prum, “its attractiveness and popularity become ends in themselves… Desire for beauty will endure and undermine the desire for truth.”
Manakin Dances and Bowerbird Nests
Now, Prum spends most of his book demonstrating the effects of this theory in practice; and he does this so beautifully that we think summarizing or even paraphrasing his descriptions of bird-mating rituals is both a sin and beyond our capabilities.
Nevertheless, we do like to at least point out to you two interesting examples. 
After going over the sex life of the Great Argus (“eminently interesting” for Darwin) as well, Prum spends the third chapter of his book describing the carefully choreographed dances of the manakins.
In lieu of words, here’s a Nat Geo video that will force you to reinterpret 
:
What about bowerbird males?
They mastered bower building millennia before humans.
Why?
Because of sex, that’s why. 
We guess some of these birds realized that if you’re not fit enough to be a boxer to beat the hell out of your competitors, you can become a poet or an architect and pray that you’ll charm the socks off of ladies through skill only.
Speaking of –
The Two Routes of Evolution and the Queering of Homo Sapiens
Unlike most of the hardcore Neo-Darwinists, Prum thinks that evolution is not merely about the survival of the fittest.
In fact, that mechanism, in his opinion, is just one of the two routes of evolution, the one in which predominantly males make the choice for females; but, there’s another more beautiful route, the one in which ladies are the ones who choose.
Different species have taken different routes.
For example, in the world of gorillas and many duck species, males use threats and force to command exclusivity in their mating access to females; often they even murder the offspring of their predecessors; this is the route of force, survival of the fittest at its brawniest.
The aesthetic route works in a much different manner; in this case, one of the sexes respects the other sex’s priorities and tries to appeal to them through certain behaviors and rituals.
The second route is the route of the modern humans; and it explains why some ostensibly counter-evolutionary behaviors and traits (homosexuality, monogamy, female orgasm, paternal care, the shrinkage of all body parts except the brains and the genitalia, permanent breasts, etc.) appeared.
In a way, most of this happened because we select each other 
 via sexual attractiveness, respecting the choice of the other sex. 
And because, consequently, for humans, sex has become a ritual, not unlike the manakin dances or the bowerbird nests.
Key Lessons from “The Evolution of Beauty”
1.      You Don’t Really Know Your Darwin
2.      The Fisherian Runaway: How Natural Selection Becomes Sexual Selection
3.      Beauty Happens – and Is All Around You
You Don’t Really Know Your Darwin
According to Prum, though his thesis may sound a bit controversial to modern Darwinists, Darwin would have undoubtedly approved of it.
Because, in addition to the natural selection theory (from the 
), he also devised a corollary sexual selection mechanism (in the 
) which aimed to explain the ornamental qualities which appear in many species – such as, for example, the highly impractical tail of the peacock:
Darwin’s Sexual Selection and the Fisherian Runaway
Darwin’s theory of mate choice includes two mechanisms – 
 and 
 – which should explain the origins and the evolution of both armament and ornament in all species.
However, the latter one was all but scoffed at by everyone – because the female choice was too subjective to be a driving evolutionary force – until Ronald Fisher tried to explain it in an interesting manner.
Namely, according to Fisher, the ornaments originally were practical signals for fitness; however, precisely because of this, in time, they evolved to become signals on their own, and future generations developed them because the individuals with these traits were the individuals with offspring.
Here’s an interesting analogy: 
Gout was historically known as the “rich man’s disease” because it appears more often in those who regularly eat meat and drink beer. So, when a poor man happened to develop gout back in the 18
 century, he wore it proudly – it gave him a chance to have sex with a money-grabber.
Beauty Happens – and Is All Around You
Prum demonstrates – through many examples from the avian world – that evolution is not only about the fittest, but also about the most beautiful or about the ones who can produce most beauty.
That’s why some birds dance and others build beautiful bowers; and that’s why humans write poems or sculpt statues of their Muses.
It’s their best shot at getting some.

After all, Steven Pinker’s objective in it is to challenge most of the modern views on what makes us human and to demonstrate that, due to modern politics and sociology, most of us are in denial when it comes to the basic building blocks of the human nature.
In a nutshell – as should be only obvious according to Pinker – these building blocks are the ones we’d describe as such

Highly influenced by Noam Chomsky, Pinker has authored numerous books in which he argues that the human aptitude for language is, more or less, preprogrammed in our brains by evolution and natural selection.
The most well-known among these is, perhaps, 
, the first of Pinker’s (so far) eight books aimed at the general public; published in 1994, the book was followed by

The other three popular science books by Pinker –

Winner of many awards, Pinker has been listed as one of the most influential intellectuals of today by numerous publications.

 “The Blank Slate PDF Summary”
In 
, Steven Pinker attempts to refute the theory that we are all born as a 
 and to demonstrate to which extent human behavior is shaped by evolutionary and psychological adaptations.
In other words, as far as Pinker is concerned, nature beats nurture by a country mile.
And he provides a lot of evidence to corroborate this claim.
Part I: The Blank Slate, The Noble Savage, and the Ghost in The Machine
In the first part of 
, Steven Pinker introduces us to the three most influential theories about human nature ever developed; and then he examines their flaws.
As the title itself reveals, this explanation of human nature is the one Pinker is interested in the most. It is also one of the earliest ones, first posited by John Locke in 
 back in 1690.
According to Locke, there is no inherent human nature: the mind is nothing more but a blank slate at birth (
in Latin) and, throughout life, experience fills it with relevant information and data.
In other words, if you were switched at birth and raised by a different set of parents, you would have developed into a completely different person.
When it was discovered in 2001 that the human genome contains several times fewer genes than what neuroscientists and geneticists initially believed, the blank slate defenders were all but sure to have won a resounding victory.
At least as far as they are concerned, our complex minds are developed gradually, via two powerful mechanisms: connectionism (the neural networks grow connections – and that’s how we learn) and 
 (the brain changes its form over a lifetime). 
The main problems?
Well, if this is the case, then why do computers (aka AI) don’t learn as well as we do? Why are even children capable of recognizing that both Garfield and your neighbor’s Siamese are cats, and yet the most powerful computers need millions of images to make that connection?
Moreover, why do twins grow to look so much like each other even when separated at birth?
More on this below.
Little more than half a century after John Locke developed the tabula rasa model of humans – namely, that we are products of our experiences – Jean-Jacques Rousseau came up with yet another theory, the idea of the Noble Savage.
In his “
,” Rousseau argued that prehistoric humans would have completely obliterated each other if their minds were blank slates and they acted in 
.
Consequently, the first humans must have been peaceful and uncompetitive, because, in addition to the fact that there weren’t that many of them, they were also living in a world which provided everything in abundance.
It was civilization that made everything worse, promoting greed and violence as a way to deal with the scarcity of resources.
Few modern authors – 
 – still believe that Rousseau was right.
However, a number of studies have shown that 
, aggression and violence included.
The third theory of human nature was first devised as a cogent theory by 
, even though it is as old as some of the earliest religious and philosophical thinkers.
In Descartes’ opinion, we are composed of two different systems, one of which is our physical/material body, and the other one which is our mind.
And as much as the former can be explained in terms of simple physics and mechanics, the latter is just too complicated to be translated into terms ordinary humans understand, because, well, it’s beyond our rational comprehension.
Modern science backs some of these claims, referring to this latter part as 
. 
However, even this division fails to explain why separated twins often grow to prefer the same brand of cigarettes!
Part II: Fear and Loathing
If a few simple experiments with twins are enough to put a question mark next to these three prevalent theories, then why are they still resiliently alive?
Steven Pinker thinks he knows why.
It isn’t because of science, he says; it is because of politics and religion, which – as you should be aware by now – are the two least scientific aspects of human existence.
Simply put, the ideology of the political left would crumble to pieces if human nature 
be explained in terms of the blank slate or the noble savage theory.
Contrarywise, the political right and many religious groups prefer “the ghost in the machine” model of human nature, because, otherwise, their notions of the world would prove to be scientifically faulty.
Consequently, as soon as modern researchers started pointing out that the natural human state is a bit more complicated than what Locke and Rousseau believed, radical Marxists attacked the ideas as “discriminatory.”
Because if humans are 
 different, and if violence is in their blood, then the idea of a utopian society where everyone is equal is, well, utopian; even more – fairytale-like, having nothing to do with reality.
On the other hand, if we think and feel due to nothing more than some chemical processes happening inside our brains, and if the mind isn’t able to live without (aka 
) the body, then most of the religions of the world make no sense whatsoever.
In conclusion, it seems that we hold on to certain beliefs of what human nature is like due to our fears that if it is any different, the world should collapse.
Part III: Human Nature with a Human Face
In the third part of 
, Steven Pinker examines further these fears; he deduces that they all boil down to four fundamental fears.
The Blank Slate theory, admits Steven Pinker, is 
appealing; after all, if every single difference is the result of nurture and upbringing, then we merely need to change the society and humans should change as well.
The Blank Slate, he says, serves as “a guarantor of political equality;” dismissing it, say its defenders, would unavoidably lead to three evils:
• 
: “if groups of people are biologically different, it could be rational to discriminate against the members of some of the groups.”
• 
: “if differences among groups in their station in life—their income, status, and crime rate, for example—come from their innate constitutions, the differences cannot be blamed on discrimination, and that makes it easy to blame the victim and tolerate inequality;”
• 
: “if people differ biologically in ways that other people value or dislike, it would invite them to try to improve society by intervening biologically—by encouraging or discouraging people’s decisions to have children, by taking that decision out of their hands, or by killing them outright.”
According to Steven Pinker, all of these are nonsequiturs, since “equality is not the empirical claim that all groups of humans are interchangeable; it is the moral principle that individuals should not be judged or constrained by the average properties of their group.”
Pinker says that all of our societies are based on a tradeoff between freedom and material equality; and “the major political philosophies can be defined by how they deal with the tradeoff”:
Now, if our genes influence our behavior to such a great extent, and if violence and immorality are 
in this sense – then how are we supposed to go on living?
“The dread of a permanently wicked human nature takes two forms,” clarifies Pinker.
The first form is rather practical: if human nature is unchangeable, then it’s a waste of time to try and change some individuals.
The second is even deeper: if it comes naturally to someone to rape someone else, then, by which measures, have we decided that this individual is fit for jail?
Hold your horses, says Pinker: if something is natural, it doesn’t mean that it’s good or that it must be tolerated.
Because just as natural as it comes to the rapist to rape someone, it comes to the raped one to defend himself/herself and to 
want to be forced into having sexual intercourse.
That’s why we have a society: to decide which of the things that come naturally to some people can be tolerated and which should not.
The second fear is related to the third one, possibly the shallowest one and the one least related to the blank slate.
Namely, the fear of determinism, the “gaping existential anxiety: that deep down we are not in control of our own choices.”
Now, if that’s the case, then why shouldn’t I use it to excuse my behaviors, no matter how immoral they are?
The answer is much the same as the one above: because we’re talking about two different systems, muddled by the Romantic idea that what’s natural is good.
Not only this most certainly is not the case, but it should also influence not one bit our legal and penitentiary institutions. 
Explaining someone else’s behavior doesn’t excuse it.
Think of it this way: even though, in 
Raskolnikov has a perfectly cogent, logical explanation as to why he has murdered two fellow human beings, he still ends up in Siberia.
It makes no difference whether the explanation is biological or a philosophical one.
“The final fear of biological explanations of the mind,” writes Pinker, “is that they may strip our lives of meaning and purpose”:
To go back to Dostoyevsky and a question he posited in another one of his classics (
): is not, in a world without God, 
 permitted?
Pinker thinks that this argument is blown out of proportions, due to at least two different reasons:
• Everything is permitted in a world 
God as well; only, in that case, it is to a selected number of people (the ones who interpret God’s message 
 than the rest); after all, both Hitler and the terrorists who crashed into the WTC believed they were carrying out a divine mission;
• There is a difference between “
 (why something evolved by natural selection)” and “proximate causation (how the entity works here and now).”
“Sometimes the most selfish thing a gene can do is wire 
 motives into a human brain—heartfelt, unstinting, deep-in-the-marrow unselfishness,” explains Pinker. 
And he goes on: “The love of children (who carry one’s genes into posterity), a faithful spouse (whose genetic fate is identical to one’s own), and friends and allies (who trust you if you’re trustworthy) can be bottomless and unimpeachable as far as we, humans, are concerned (proximate level), even if it is metaphorically self-serving as far as the genes are concerned (ultimate level).”
Part IV: Know Thyself
Even centuries after the three visions of the human nature described in Part I above were first proposed, people still think of humans along these lines.
For classical economists, for example, humans are still those rational self-interested people who base all of their decision on whether they benefit them personally; utopian socialists, on the other hand, are even surer that humans are biologically nothing less than noble savages who’d much rather live in peace than die by violence.
Science has conclusively shown, however, that neither of these views is accurate: we are neither selfish egoists nor selfless altruists.
We are something in-between.
We prefer to live in harmony with others because, evolutionary, this has helped us survive; misanthropes never stood a chance in ancient societies, and tribes thrived.
However, there are limits to our desire to live in a community, and you can discover those limits if you take a look at the history of the Israeli kibbutzim, collective communities envisioned as utopian a century ago.
However, in time, this vision evolved since, for example, mothers wanted to sleep next to their children and didn’t want them to be raised communally. 
When you think about it, as much as classical economists say that humans are by nature competitive, they almost never steal food from their children, loved ones or close relatives – even when very hungry.
However, they might even kill someone they don’t know in that situation. 
Part V: Hot Buttons
In the final part of his book, Steven Pinker tries to show how science can help us reach some common ground in relation to some of the most hotly debated topics in all times and all places:
• 
. Unfortunately, it seems that a large part of our political beliefs is in our blood: twins, separated at birth, share 0.62 (out of 1) of their political beliefs; it is because of the rest 0.38 that there are changes; education may help;
• 
. Once again, violence is hereditary, and it is an inseparable trait of the human nature; prehistoric societies were violent, and no matter how much we progress, future societies will be violent as well; interestingly enough, economic equality seems to stifle violence;
• 
. Male and female brains aren’t interchangeable: they are different; while women are better at spelling, reading body language and matching shapes, men have a stronger capacity to manipulate 3D objects mentally; but science has found no reason whatsoever to believe that one gender is more superior than the other;
• 
. According to Eric Turkheimer, three things influence how children turn out to grow up in the end: their genes, their family environment, their unique environment (friends and neighborhood); we don’t know the ratio, but these are the estimates: genes: 40%, family: 10%, unique environment: 50%.
• 
. Art is in our nature – in the blood and in the bone, in our brains and in our genes. However, we seem to be evolutionarily programmed to prefer traditional art and beauty to their modern counterparts; art, in other words, is not in decline; conventional art 
– and this has to be remedied as soon as possible.
Key Lessons from “The Blank Slate”
1.      There Are Three Theories of the Human Nature – and All Are Flawed
2.      The Blank Slate Is a Political Vision of the Human Nature
3.      Facing the Facts Doesn’t Mean Tolerating Them
There Are Three Theories of the Human Nature – and All Are Flawed
Throughout history, there have been three attempts to describe the human nature:
• 
: experience makes us who we are: at birth, we are all equal;
• 
: human nature was originally benevolent and cooperative – civilization ruined us;
• 
: our body can be explained in matters of mechanics; the same isn’t true in relation to our brain.
According to Steven Pinker – and science – none of these three theories makes sense.
The Blank Slate Is a Political Vision of the Human Nature
The most resilient of these three theories seem to be the Lockean: the blank slate. However, the main reason why we still believe it is an accurate depiction of human nature is political.
Put simply, believing that we are biologically one way or another is, on the surface, much more dangerous than believing that society makes us who we are; if the latter is true, then we can still talk about equality and sexual freedom; however, the former seems too restricting.
Facing the Facts Doesn’t Mean Tolerating Them
However, Pinker shows that all of those fears of biologically determined human nature – the fears of inequality, of imperfectability, of determinism, and of nihilism – are nonsequiturs.
The fact that we’ve got to here is evidence enough.
We don’t need to be 
to be 
, nor do we need to be inherently altruistic to start caring about some other people in a more rational manner; finally, if our biological constitution is purposeless in terms of grand meaning – then why shouldn’t we just invent one?
We’re good at doing that.

Mark Nepo, the author of the eulogized 
is back with another classic of the same kind:
.
Stay with us and get a glimpse on how to find the wisdom that waits in your heart.
Who Should Read “The One Life We’re Given”? And Why?
On November 19 and November 22, 2010, Oprah Winfrey hosted the biggest Favorite Things show to date; on its second day, between Josh Groban’s 
and a Talbott Teas holiday assortment she listed a book which was little-known by then: Mark Nepo’s 
Unsurprisingly, this launched Nepo’s 2000 book to the top of the 
 bestseller list, where it stayed for a while.
Considering the fact that Oprah subsequently named Nepo one of the 100 most inspiring visionaries of today, it’s only natural that all of Nepo’s subsequent books have been both eagerly awaited and well received.
is not an exception.
Combining poetry, personal stories and spiritual lessons, this book is for anyone who wants to discover the innermost parts of his soul; and find a way to come to terms with them or elevate them to a higher plane of being.
About Mark Nepo
 is an American poet, philosopher, and spiritual adviser, dubbed “a consummate storyteller,” “an eloquent spiritual teacher,” and “one of the finest spiritual guides of our time.”
After obtaining a doctorate in English, Nepo taught for almost two decades at the State University of New York in Albany, New York; afterward, he moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan where he still lives.
In 1987, Nepo was diagnosed with a rare form of lymphoma, a struggle which helped him form an idiosyncratic and syncretic spiritual philosophy which he has since shared in a number of books. 
The most famous among them is 
, which though published in 2000 made it to the top of 
bestseller list a decade later, after being endorsed by Oprah who included Nepo in both her 
and the 
 program.
Many of Nepo’s recent works have been included in 
’s list of best spiritual books:

On his webpage, Mark Nepo notes that 
“affirms how precious this one life is and opens the chance we have to be fully alive and to be of use to each other and the world.”
In other words, it moves on from where 
 left off, and it’s unsurprising that it shares much the same short-chapter format of that book.
“A continuous inquiry in what it means to be human, to be here, and to care for one another,” 
is divided into four thematic sections, each of which contains twenty or so few pages’ long chapters.
Each chapter contains an autobiographical story, a metaphor or some other type of example “that brings a question or quandary of living into view.”
Next, Nepo digs deeper and uncovers the lesson hidden beneath these stories.
Finally, he offers a question, a meditation, or a type of conversation to have with a loved one.
Nepo calls these “seeds of water along the way” and invites you to keep a journal as you read, “as an intimate space where you might hear your soul, as a sketchbook where your heart can personalize the themes” explored by the book.
Since there are so many of them, it is very difficult to summarize this book; if we have to use just one excerpt to do so, it will certainly be this one:
Key Lessons from “The One Life We’re Given”
1.      Getting Closer to Life: Your Legacy and Your Personal Mythology
2.      Loving What You Do: Touch the Branches of Meaning
3.      Finding What Can Last: Face the Serpent King
4.      Being Kind and Useful: Cultivating Wonder and Self-Awareness
Getting Closer to Life: Your Legacy and Your Personal Mythology
Your life is what is happening to you at this very moment; and yet, most of the people reading this sentence think that it’s something about to begin, something in the distance.
Unfortunately, it is usually the undesirable events in life which awake us to its mystery and beauty, to the fact that it is all around us and that we must get closer to it before it slips away.
Three years before Mark Nepo published 
, his father, Morris Nepo, died at the age of 93.
Sitting beside him during the last months of his life, Mark started thinking about what his father had left behind him; and that called into his mind the fact that he is part of a lineage that goes way back to a Russian leatherworker, his great-grandfather.
“When in trouble,” he would supposedly say – remembering the time he fell into a river after being chased by Cossacks who didn’t kill him because they didn’t want their horses to get cold – “wait till you see a way out.”
Mark’s grandfather lived through the Great Depression in the US. “Break whatever we have in half,” he’d say to his wife when she’d complain that they don’t have enough. “It will be enough.”
And what sentence was Morris’ legacy?
“Give me a minute, and I’ll figure out what to do” – the thing he’d always say to his wife, no matter the hardship or the circumstance.
After braiding their lessons into a rope he can use, now it’s time for Mark to leave a legacy, a personal story his loved ones will further braid into the rope.
And that rope, you see, that’s the essence of a few personal myths; even the largest ones began the way this chapter does.
Loving What You Do: Touch the Branches of Meaning
“Regardless of what you do for living,” writes Mark Nepo in the first chapter of the second section of 
(“Bring Up the Lights”), “the only important vocation is listening to the heart when it says: this is vital, this is alive, this can’t be lost.”
Most of the things we have that help us go through life – “every book and form of art, every keepsake and treasure we pass from generation to generation, every story told” – are this kind of cries of the heart.
Someone, somewhere, sometime thought that something mustn’t be lost; and he made every attempt in his power to make sure that it won’t. 
“No one knows how to live or how to die,” writes Nepo. “We only know how to love and how to lose, and how to pick up branches of meaning along the way.”
These are, in fact, the words a wise old woman tells to a widower who has lost all faith in life after the death of his wife. 
He comes to her to ask for advice, and instead, the woman asks him to poke a branch through a running stream and feel the movement of the water.
“You see,” she says to him, “that you can feel the water without putting your hand in the water, this is what meaning feels like.”
That’s how we feel the presence of someone who is absent; and that’s how meaning saves us.
By way of proxy – even when it’s seen through the glass, darkly.
Finding What Can Last: Face the Serpent King
In one of the chapters of the third section of 
, Mark Nepo talks about fear – and relates a story about his crippling fear of snakes.
Two decades before he published the book, Nepo noticed a large snake (about five feet long) in a crack of the front stoop of his house.
Incapable of facing it, but fearing for the safety of his family, he did the first thing that came to his mind: he bought a liquid concrete and sealed the snake within the crack.
However, a few hours later, he noticed that the snake had somehow managed to slither away.
There was no way out now: the only thing he was left to do was to kill it; so he did.
However, after dumping the remains, the fear was not gone. “I couldn’t calm my heart,” writes Nepo. “I came close to vomiting several times, and wondered why it had never occurred to me to call someone to take the snake away. I’d let my fear create a life for itself.”
The story doesn’t end there.
Twenty years later, Mark – now with his new wife – took a walk and a small snake jumped in front of his feet; then another one; and then a third one.
Mark Nepo realized in a second what was happening: it was his karma, coming back to haunt him for needlessly taking away the life of another sentient being.
He concludes:
Being Kind and Useful: Cultivating Wonder and Self-Awareness
One of the chapters in the final section of his book, Nepo begins with a quote by George Bernard Shaw: “the only man I know who behaves sensibly is my tailor; he takes my measurements anew each time he sees me. The rest go on with their old measurements and expect me to fit them.”
This is the work of self-awareness, says Nepo: to be our own tailor, to take those measurements (whether ours or someone else’s) anew, over and over again.
For these are the eyes of the child, the ones which see everything as if they have never seen it before; the ones which seem to always say: “Oh, my God, look at that magnificent something!”
These are, of course, the eyes everyone should have, filled with wonder and astonishment:

Think you know yourself?
Think again!
Timothy D. Wilson’s research into the adaptive unconscious uncovers a startling truth: 
We are all 
.
Who Should Read “Strangers to Ourselves”? And Why?
Timothy D. Wilson is a professor at the University of Virginia and one of the foremost and most distinguished researchers on self-knowledge and the unconscious mind in the world today.
Consequently, if you are interested in psychology and you really know your Freuds and 
, then 
should be at the top of your next month’s reading list.
Eye-opening and groundbreaking, Wilson’s book should invite the interest of both specialized and casual readers: it’s Malcolm Gladwell’s favorite book (see the “Critical Review” section), and we won’t be surprised if you start listing it among yours as well – as soon as you finish it.
About Timothy D. Wilson
 is an American social psychologist, the Sherrell J. Aston Professor of Psychology at the University of Virginia, and the author of two very popular books on psychology, 
 and 
.
Known for his research in areas such as the limits of introspection and unconscious processing, together with his long-time collaborator 
, Timothy D. Wilson is widely considered one of the leading social psychologists of today.
In fact, his 1977 article “Telling more than we can know – verbal reports on mental processes” (co-authored with Richard Nisbett) is one of the most cited psychology articles in history, and his introductory primer 
(co-authored with 
 and Robin Akert) is used as a textbook at many universities around the world.
In addition, Wilson is the winner of several awards, such as the All-University Outstanding Teaching Award (2001) and the University of Virginia Distinguished Scientist Award (2010); since 2009, he is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Chapter 1: Freud’s Genius, Freud’s Myopia
Two thousand years ago, in the pronaos of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi – at least according to ancient writers – still stood inscribed one of the most famous maxims in the history of philosophy: “Know thyself!”
And up until the end of the 19
 century, many people believed that, buried beneath those two words, there lay an eternal truth, an almost divine imperative: not knowing yourself was a sin; knowing yourself was the only right way to go about in life.
And then came 
 and uncovered a frightening secret, one which nobody was prepared to hear out loud: it is difficult to know yourself, and that’s because most of your mind operates 
.
: not only is not all thinking conscious thinking, but 
 
eludes us.
Interestingly enough, as Wilson shows, this is not something uncovered by Freud; philosophers and thinkers such as Leibnitz and Pascal, Shelling and William Hamilton had devised theories of the unconscious long before the Austrian.
They all shared the belief that some of our thinking is automatic and that some of our prejudices are beyond our rationality; even more, that we may be wrong about many of our own feelings and that some things, well, we just do (despite what we think about them).
What these authors intuited and Freud failed to see is that the unconscious is, almost by definition, ungraspable through introspection.
And that’s one of the scariest sentences you’ll ever read.
Chapter 2: The Adaptive Unconscious
“Consider that at any given moment,” writes Timothy Wilson in the second chapter of 
, “our five senses are taking in more than 11,000,000 pieces of information.”
That’s a lot!
So much, in fact, that scientists have long wondered about the capability of our conscious mind to process that many signals at any given moment.
The short answer: no, it cannot. 
The long answer: not only it cannot, but it is also incredibly bad at it. In fact, “the most liberal estimate is that people can process consciously about 40 pieces of information per second.”
Where does the rest of it go?
You’ve guessed it alright!
Down the drain, hidden from sight, in the adaptive unconscious, from where it constantly lurks and influences us.
Which is why Wilson neatly defines the adaptive unconscious thus:
But how does the unconscious influence your feelings, judgments, and behavior? 
Well, we have some vague sense about it.
You’ll make no mistake to think of it as a sort of a guardian angel, filtering out information it deems unnecessary or harmful so that it can protect your psychological wellbeing – in much the same manner that your physical wellbeing is protected by your 
.
“When it comes to maintaining a sense of well-being,” writes Wilson, “each of us is the ultimate spin doctor.”
OK, that’s a strange kind of a guardian angel – one that spits in the face of everything you know about yourself.
Or at least you think you do.
Chapter 3: Who’s in Charge?
To answer the question from the title of this chapter, you have to first understand that your unconscious mind is much older than your conscious mind; and that the role of the latter is, in many cases, to create an illusion of control.
In other words, both your unconscious and conscious mind work simultaneously inside your head; however, most of the time, you feel as if your conscious mind has everything under control.
“A more accurate view of the role of consciousness,” writes Wilson, “may be consciousness-as–Ronald Reagan.” 
Put simply: your consciousness is (both to you and itself) your presidential self, the Great Communicator, the executive power; but, in fact, it is no more than “a spokesperson for a cadre of smart and hardworking powers (actually layers of powers), some known to outsiders, and some unknown.”
So, the truth is – it’s difficult to say who’s in charge and when; but it’s somewhat easier to note the differences between the two thinking authorities working inside you.
You want to hear the most interesting and frightening part of Wilson’s analysis?
We have absolutely no system inside us to decide which task would be better processed by which system; the only system at work seems to be 
.
Hence all of your prejudices, 
, beliefs not supported by stats, etc. etc.
Chapter 4: Knowing Who We Are
The reason why it is difficult to discover who you are is very simple: you are not one person.
There are at least two personalities inside you, one accessible and constructed by your conscious self, and another all but unreachable and created by your adaptive unconscious.
Up until the 1970s, almost all research was focused on the first type of personality; after all, it was the only one of whose existence we could be sure of.
And then, in 1968, a guy named Walter Mischel discovered that none of the approaches popular at the time “met the gold standard of personality research very well, namely [Gordon] Allport’s criterion of predicting with any certainty what people actually do”:
What Mischel actually discovered was that our “characteristic behavior and thought” (Allport’s definition of a theory of personality) actually a mixed genre.
Namely, in addition to being non-fictional (what our conscious mind objectively thinks is our characteristic behavior) it is also at least as much a fiction, created by our conscious mind to describe the actions of our adaptive unconscious.
Mischel described at least 5 (if-then) rules which guide behavior:
• encodings (people’s constructs of themselves and others);
• expectancies about themselves and the world;
• affectations and emotions;
• goals and values;
• competencies and self-regulatory plans.
Chapter 5: Knowing Why
Whether you like it or not, as we already told you while summarizing David McRaney’s 
, “you are often ignorant of your motivations and create fictional narratives to explain your decisions, emotions, and history without realizing it.”
It’s called confabulation and is what you may be doing all the time to stay alive and healthy.
To test out the implications of this, Timothy Wilson and his collaborator Richard Nisbett showed four identical pairs of pantyhose to numerous people.
Their job was to choose their favorite one.
The strange thing is that all of them 
 chose one; the even stranger one is that almost all of them had an explanation for their choice.
Unfortunately, these explanations may be nothing more but a way of your conscious mind to explain the decisions of the unconscious mind, and, thus provide your sometimes-inexplicable actions with a “why.”
Our explanations of our own behavior are often no more accurate than the explanations a total stranger may have and are based on four general types of information:
• 
 (such as “people are in bad moods on Mondays” or “opposites attract each other”);
• 
(first we observe our own responses and then infer what is causing them: I like these two movies, and DeNiro is starring in each of them – I like DeNiro);
• 
 (“People have idiosyncratic theories about the causes of their responses that are not shared by the culture at large, such as the theory that going to large parties often makes them depressed.”
• 
Chapter 6: Knowing How We Feel
According to many philosophers – Descartes and Wittgenstein among them – “reports about sensations and feelings are incorrigible.”
In other words, if you feel that your head hurts and you claim that it does, then it most certainly 
, regardless of whether doctors can find something wrong with it.
And there are at least two reasons why almost everybody believes to be so: the measurement and the theory problem.
According to the measurement problem, “even if people can be wrong about their feelings in principle, we have no way of knowing if and when this is the case because we do not have a pipeline to people’s feelings that is independent of their self-reports.”
The theory problem, on the other hand, is “the question of how and why the mind would be organized in such a way that people can be wrong about their feelings. Why on earth would humans be built this way?”
However, Wilson shows why both the measurement and the theory problem are not enough to dismiss the idea that reports about sensations are incorrigible.
In the case of the measurement problem, there is often evidence that self-reports are false and can be discounted: husbands often say that they are tired when they are, in fact, jealous; and their wives can guess this.
In the case of the theory problem, it’s even simpler: the functional approach can’t explain many other things (such as dreams, contagious yawning, lefties), so why should it be able to explain all reports of feelings?
In addition, there are people who suffer from alexithymia, a condition in which they are unable to explain the things they authentically feel.
Chapter 7: Knowing How We Will Feel
Think winning the lottery will make you happy?
Think again!
Studies show that most lottery winners are actually miserable after winning the lottery.
The reason?
Their only goal was to win it, and, unfortunately, they overestimated the duration of happiness this will bring them.
In truth, we all this: we think that finding the perfect partner will make us happy forever or that the death of a closed one will cripple us for eternity.
The truth is, we’ll overcome the latter, and the former will make us happy only for a certain amount of time.
We are resilient because we have a sort of an allostasis mechanism which prevents us from experiencing extremes, regardless of whether they are positive or negative.
Simply put, we tend to 
everything, so that we can survive: unless we rob some events of their emotional power, we may be unable to function properly in their absence (if positive) or constant presence (if negative).
Think of what happens to your ears when you go to a crowded place in which there’s loud music; at first, you can’t really understand what’s happening, but then you can even discern voices. Your ears equalize the noise; well, so does your mind when it comes to feelings.
You can encourage it to do this by setting yourself a goal toward which you need to work; 
, as long as you have a goal, you can recover from everything.
Chapter 8: Introspection and Self-Narratives
“Introspection,” writes Wilson, “is a very broad term, covering many different ways of examining the contents of one’s own mind.”
Either way, whether it’s “brief, off-the-cuff attempts to figure out how we feel about something” or “decades-long self-analyses recorded in lengthy journals,” introspection is incapable of helping us find out how our unconscious is working.
Because it is hidden by a self-narrative, the biography of ourselves written by us, whose goal is not to make us known to us better, but to help us find our way around.
The most important thing to note here is that more accurate self-narrative doesn’t necessarily mean a more functional person.
In fact, it is often the other way around.
For example, according to a well-known study, students who analyze why they have chosen a poster for their room feel much less happy about it two weeks later than students who don’t.
Even stranger, relationships tend to last longer with people who scrutinize them less often and less profound; and the ones who do may be wrong; it doesn’t matter.
Does this mean that we shouldn’t be collecting information?
No.
It only means that we should collect just enough data so that we can inform our unconscious to make a gut decision, and then let our conscious mind to stabilize it in a narrative we’ll firmly believe in.
Too many questions – and you’ll threaten the stability of the narrative. 
And that’s rarely a good idea.
Chapter 9: Looking Outward to Know Ourselves
Consider this: instinctually, you have nothing more than a vague idea of how your pulmonary system works and, yet, you breathe.
The only way to find out what happens inside you when you do is if you consult outside information.
Why should it be any different with your psychological system?
Interestingly enough – and contrary to just about every self-help book ever written – this means that you should listen to what others are saying about you much more than you do; because they actually know more about you than yourself.
Why?
Simply put, they see you how you act and do not have access to the narratives you use to explain your actions; so, they devise their own.
Studies show that these are necessarily more objective than your survival-driven self-narratives.
Of course, people tend to lie, and we sometimes project our theories and analyze their words through them.
Either way, when it comes to your behavior and your personality, the lesson is this: believe others at least as much as you believe yourself, if not more.
Chapter 10: Observing and Changing our Behavior
There’s also another thing you can do in addition to observing others observing you; namely – analyzing your actions.
In other words, try to dissever your actions from the things you think are your motivations and then try to find patterns among them.
You’ll be surprised to find out that, at least some of the time, your motivations are actually hidden from you.
And that you’ve hidden them from yourself.
Can you hack the system?
Apparently, you can.
And it’s as simple as that AA motto: 
.
Namely, act like the person you want to become, and that may trick your unconscious into believing that this is the person you are.
Or, in the words of Wilson:
Key Lessons from “Strangers to Ourselves”
1.      You Don’t Know Much About Yourself: You Is Someone Else
2.      Want to Know Yourself Better? Ask Your Friends What They Think of You!
3.      Fool Your Unconscious: Act as the Person You Want to Be
You Don’t Know Much About Yourself: You Is Someone Else
“I is someone else,” wrote French poet Arthur Rimbaud a century and a half ago.
Science thinks that he was pretty right: contrary to what philosophers try to inspire us, we are incapable of knowing ourselves.
Not due to lack of effort, but because there are at least two personalities inside us, one of which (the adaptive unconscious) is beyond our reach.
In other words, much of what you do, you do for reasons you don’t know and may never find out.
Want to Know Yourself Better? Ask Your Friends What They Think of You!
The reason why you see yourself differently than how others see you is simple: you invent self-narratives which help you function better which often don’t correlate with the objective truth (if that’s at all attainable).
In other words, other people know you better than you know yourself because they don’t have mechanisms inside them to justify your behavior.
That’s why peer reports tend to predict better the behavior of people than self-reports: as much as the latter are related to the conscious part of our own beings, the former delve into the adaptive unconscious, virtually unknown to us.
Fool Your Unconscious: Act as the Person You Want to Be
Many therapies for both alcoholics and chronically depressive people include a well-known and sometimes unjustly ridiculed credo: fake it until you make it.
There’s a reason for this.
Deliberately changing your behavior (your conscious mind telling your body to do something your body is refusing to do), in time, will certainly affect your self-conception and may even alter your unconscious being.
“Little steps can lead to big changes… and all of us have the ability to act more like the person we want to be.”

“Strangers to Ourselves Quotes”
Our Critical Review
“In 
,” 
 about a decade ago, “I probably owe a bigger intellectual debt to Tim Wilson (and his longtime collaborator, Jonathan Schooler) than anyone else, and 
 is probably the most influential book I’ve ever read.”
Describing his own work as “a kind of popularized version of Wilson’s own work,” Gladwell goes on to note that in the “beautifully written” 
Wilson is such a crucial book because it “asks the question: what, at the end of the day, can we really know about ourselves?”
The answer: “not much. Or, at least, not nearly as much as we think we can know. But it’s a tribute to Wilson, that in giving that answer he is never disheartening or depressing.”
“A rare combination of lucid prose, penetrating insight, and cutting-edge research” (Gilbert), 
“covers many diverse areas of psychology in a very accessible style… to make a radical argument: that for the most part, we have very little real understanding of how we work, or why we do even the most ordinary things” (John Bargh).
A truly fascinating read: precisely what books ought to be all about."

Not everybody is ready to cut through the BS and get to the point.
Mel understands why motivational quotes and phrases are viewed with a negative connotation and wants to lift the veil on the stuff that actually yields positive results.
Furthermore, she delivers an outline of the theory of being happy, and why it contradicts with the mainstream narrative.
Let’s delve into it.
Who Should Read “Stop Saying You’re Fine”? And Why?
Sometimes, you’ll be chastised by your colleagues, friends or even family, and you don’t have to pretend that you are fine.
On the second thought, some people reckon that beliefs form the inner reality, even when these notions are nothing but self-created.
Anyway, “
” unravels the cause of downheartedness and helps you to pick up the pace in generating a response. As such, we find it highly insightful and immensely practical for the general audience.
Giving it a quick read is the least you can do. 
About Mel Robbins
 obtained a law degree from Boston College Law School in 1994. Before becoming a CNN commentator, she worked as a criminal defense attorney.
Mel Robbins rose to prominence with her TED Talk “
.”
Her book “
” written in 2017 is an international bestseller!
“Stop Saying You’re Fine PDF Summary”
There are some days when you are filled with excitement, and you’re ready to seize the day. The coffee smells good, and at work, you leave no stone unturned in the pursuit to make the most out of everything.
You are ready to go the extra mile, but how long will that last?
It’s one of those days when you feel invincible and eager to step up regardless of the risk.  
Yes, but in the meantime, an equally powerful force holds you back, using a wide array of concealed tools.
This form of resistance stems from our lower version of ourselves, and it impedes the progress. The safe zone becomes the omnipresent reality and the preferred choice! You no longer have the passion for going the extra mile, and you’d rather be in the “known.”
In all honesty, resistance is winning on the long-haul.
Just think about it for a moment.
The alarm goes off, and you have to jump out of bed, walk barefooted to the bathroom, get yourself ready to do a bit of morning exercising.
Whose idea was it, in the first place? 
You hit the snooze button, and curl up in your bed. It feels good, besides, it’s just one day; it’s no big deal! 
When that snooze button is activated, we transfer our power over to something external. Later on, you try to summon up every ounce of strength to make up for this minor setback, but you feel strangled between different expectations.
Who wants to be stuck in a dead-end job for years? Besides, why would someone be motivated to do that kind of job? 
Well, it’s not about the job, nor the performance, it’s about the passion for taking control over your life.
Feeling stuck is a very vague term.
It merely explains our position when there’s no particular problem to be solved, but you have this sense of edginess. It seems as if something is missing, but you can’t quite nail down what that is. You decide to rationalize the problem, and make excuses.
In all honesty, it’s easier to pass up on the opportunity and turn a deaf ear to the voice of reason. In doing so, you get the load off, but at the price of abandoning your dreams.
You have to understand that this feeling of perpetual stuckness will not fade away on its own accord.
When you enter a routine, the mind loses its creativity, and you have to suffer the consequences.
The same applies to marriages.
At first, you visualize how awesome it’ll be, and you romanticize even the trivial tasks. In the foreseeable future, you find yourself just doing the same old stuff over and over again. Monotony is killing you from the inside, but on the surface, it doesn’t feel like a problem at all. 
You understand that change is inevitable, but how, when, why – all of these answerless questions can overwhelm you.
Your life demands a challenge, something to stimulate growth but it’s so hard to burst this bubble. 
Wanting something from the bottom of our heart is a good first step, but without taking action, it’s all for nothing. We just sit there in the corner of the room, (actionless) contemplating our life choices, and trying to find the missing link.
To illustrate a point, Mel puts Brian in the spotlight.
Brian is annoyed with the way life has turned out for him. Back in college, he would have jumped into a crappy car, drive miles down the road to pay a visit to a friend, meet new people and have his ideas challenged. Now, all he has left is a meaningless job, which pays the bills. 
He complains about the lack of intimacy with his wife Jennifer and fantasizes about Molly who has started working at the company a couple of months ago. 
As you can see, Brian tends to pass the blame onto others. If he had realized his mistake, he would have ended things with Molly, initiated a dialogue with Jennifer, and perhaps wrote a business plan by now.
But sometimes, when this resistance takes over our body and mind, we start acting like jerks. Out of habit, we orchestrate an illusion that there’s no alternative route. The truth is – we don’t have the guts nor the audacity to make a bold move. 
Do you want a straight-out answer?
Your “stuckness” has little to do with the exhausting to-do list. When simple chores pile up, we feel like not having enough free-time is the only reason for our economic and mental slump.
In order to 
, you have to be good at thriving under pressure.
Mel doesn’t circumvent the struggle, and tells us the way things are, not how we would want them to be!
Despite what everyone is saying, making a change is not easy. Trying something new, and getting out of the stigma that holds you imprisoned is always harder than it seems at first glance. An idea can get you all fired up, but just as easily put you in dejection when negativity rolls in.
These days, we have the victim-cult mentality that is practiced and embraced by many individuals. 
Bearing the brunt of negativity can be very complicated, mostly because it pushes your psychological snooze buttons.
There’s something strange about getting stuck; it looks like an epidemic we cannot outrun. The external reality never takes into account your emotional situation, and the frantic pace of the digital age only makes things worse. 
Hence, it’s hard to be at your best, and distinguish yourself from the herd. 
When you reach adulthood, you are compelled to make decisions. For some, this is a heavy burden that robs them of joy and playfulness.
The truth of the matter is, both internal and external tendencies instigate this sense of captivity. And it’s not easy to break from the daily grind, let alone changing your whole mindset. 
The uncertainty and the struggle create this illusion of being stuck.
The main thing is to resist the urge to jump on the latest bandwagon and understand how you can maintain 
.
Gauge the level of effort you put in, day in and day out, and conduct the same testing with regards to action-taking and procrastination.
According to Mel, an action is only a thought brought to life.
So, the first thing you ought to do is quell the surge of emotions, and focus on rationally. 
Mel reckons that it’s hard to point out your true desires when you’re immersed in your work or story. It may come as a surprise to you, but breathing new life into your ideas is not something that comes as an end result of a surreal narrative.
First and foremost, we have to take a stand against the fictional approach of dealing with things. Next, we need to find out what comprises the reality.
You can start by taking into consideration the seven major areas of your life: 
Bear in mind that nurturing positive connections with others is the backbone of life.
Here’s the step-by-step process that can help you identify which actions generate the best results, and give you support in the pursuit of fulfilling your lifelong ambitions:
Leaning in is most definitely a philosophy that can bring about change if you understand its meaning.
Seth’s life was literally a mess. Married at a young age to a woman he barely knew, which led to a divorce. He lost half of his marital assets, and pretty much all of his friends.
Huge problems only continued to pile up from there.
He had no real plan to tackle this aimless state, until one day, he had enough! So, the question was – What to do?
He was afraid of heights for as long as he could remember and had the “craziest” idea one can come up with. He boarded a plane, wearing a jumpsuit, hooked up to the instructor, and ready to jump from 10,000 feet. However, during the flight, he got this weird feeling.
What was I thinking? – No way! The instructor told him, the ride down is free, so he plucked up his courage and just went for it! 
And yes, he wasn’t doing any insane skydiving maneuvers in midair, but he did break the ice. 
Now you might wonder, what leaning in represents?
It’s about taking those small actions and building that momentum when the odds are against you. It takes a tremendous amount of courage and spirit to push forward and find real meaning in the things that you do. 
Key Lessons from “Stop Saying You’re Fine”
1.      Get up and start making things happen
2.      Keep your composure
3.      Take one step at the time
Get up and start making things happen
By all means, this is one of the most straightforward advice you’ll ever come across with. 
If you believe that someone else should be held accountable for your life, and choices, prepare yourself for a bumpy ride.
People who have this urge to scale their careers or improve their lives must start with this simple test: 
Who’s to blame? – You!
Keep your composure
It’s easy to veer off course when you make decisions on a whim. 
Keep your cool, analyze what’s holding you down, and then take action. If you are afraid to step in and figure out a solution, you’ll never get to the top.
In order to become a winner, you have to act like one.
Take one step at the time
No one asks of you to reinvent the wheel.
The only thing you are required to do is to take small steps towards a certain goal.
Keep doing this on a daily basis, and you’ll see that sooner or later, the sun will shine on you again.

: 
The book starts from the premise that small changes can produce great results.
If you want to learn how to efficiently stay in shape and without hunger, how to have good nights of sleep, run better and even how to improve your sex life, this is the ideal book for you.
You do not have to have good genetics or count on luck to do it! Author Tim Ferriss explains how to get better results from the least effort with simplicity. Let’s go on this adventure for health and well-being?
The 4-Hour Body Summary
The rules of weight loss always say that some things are impossible: you cannot lose more than 1kg per week; You can not change your muscle type; the only way to lose weight is by cutting calories.
The Foundations Of The 4-Hour Body Plan (4HB)
You have heard all these things and tried to be healthier, but the reality is these rules are not as accurate as most think.
You can do some things differently, small changes that will allow you to reach your ideal weight.
The purpose of 4HB is to show what you can change in your life to improve your health regarding weight loss, sleep 
, physical stamina, and overall longevity.
Tim tells the story of Arthur Jones. He was one of the most influential people in the field of physical education.
Jones did a lot of research and experimentation and left a substantial legacy. One such legacy was the idea of an Effective Minimum Dose (EMD).
The EMD is the least amount of something that will produce the desired result.
For example, the minimum amount of exercise you need to do to see results is the exercise EMD for you. If you overdo your EMD in any situation, you can interrupt your progress and hinder your efforts.
If you think about reinventing your life, especially with regards to your physical appearance, removing stored fat and gaining muscle are two essential elements.
When it comes to stored fat, you need to find out your EMD to activate fat burning hormones.
To gain muscle, you need to find out your EMD which activates muscle growth and the hormone responsible for it.
Experiments show that losing weight is not as simple as just counting calories.
Calories should not be your focus to achieve weight loss. In fact, calories are only considered significant because they are measurable and monitorable in tests. The 4HB plan will not make you count and cut calories to lose fat.
Your motivation needs to be large enough that you not only start the process but also stick to it. You need to monitor your progress by always measuring your results to keep you on track.
Measuring And Accompanying The Results
When you start following the 4HB plan, you will lose body fat and gain muscle.
You will begin to notice a substantial difference in your weight in the first few months. You may also notice that your weight loss will begin to get less dramatic after the initial three months.
While you lose fat, you are gaining muscle as well. Muscle gain appears on the scale, so even though you are still losing fat, it will not appear because of the muscles you gain in the process.
You cannot let the numbers on the scale hinder your progress.
If you are the type of person who needs to see measurable results in terms of 
, there are some tests you can do to determine the fat percentage.
When you begin the plan, write down your measurements so that you see your progress throughout.
Begin by measuring your circumference. Use a tape measure, note the size of your upper arms (middle biceps), your waist, your hip at the widest point and both of your legs.
Add these measures to determine your overall measures. Next, estimate your percentage of body fat based on your body shape.
Eliminating Fat
When you are following the 4HB plan, your diet will be low-carb. If you follow the diet correctly, you can lose up to 10kg of fat in a month.
The first rule of dieting is to avoid white carbs. These foods are banned during the diet, except thirty minutes after a high-strength workout.
That means you’ll need to cut out all bread, rice, cereal, potatoes, pasta, and fried breaded foods. That includes whole foods as well.
The second rule is to have repeat meals. You can mix the foods in your meals, but you should eat the same foods in your meals. These are the foods allowed:
You can eat as much as you want from the above foods. You also need to make sure you have enough vegetables to maintain your caloric intake while you are on a diet, as vegetables do not have many calories.
Make three to four meals and repeat them every day. If you are going to eat in a restaurant, or anywhere but your house, ask to replace the starch with more vegetables.
You can also eat other vegetables that are not listed above; Just stay away from potatoes.
You may have noticed that there is no milk on this list. Milk is forbidden as it causes a high insulin response in the body. The only dairy product that is allowed is cottage cheese since it is high in protein.
Butter is also allowed as long as it is pure butter and has only butter and salt in its ingredients list.
t. You need to make your first meal of the day the first hour you wake up. From there, your meals should have a 4 hours gap.
If you NEED to snack between meals, carrots are the best thing to eat but do not eat too many. If you have noticed that you are getting hungry between meals, you are not eating enough and you should increase your portions.
The third rule is to stay away from liquid calories. You can drink as much water as you want, unsweetened tea, black coffee or other non-calorie beverages. You cannot drink milk, soda or fruit juices.
You can drink soda diets, but need to limit yourself to 400ml per day. Alcoholic beverages should be avoided. However, you can take two glasses of red wine a day.
The fourth rule is to stop eating fruits. That may seem strange, but the reality is that you do not need to eat fruits to be healthy. The only fruits allowed in the diet are tomatoes and avocado. Avocado should be limited to one unit per day.
The fifth and final rule is to take a day off per week in which you can eat anything you want in any amount. That is not just to help you not give up; There are also benefits of weight loss.
When you increase your calorie intake dramatically, you will actually help your fat loss by ensuring that your metabolic rate does not get slow because of the long periods of calorie restriction.
You will notice that you have gained weight after your day off but as long as you follow the plan on all other days, you will lose that weight within the next 48 hours.
Beyond the diet, you can take supplements like potassium, magnesium, and calcium. You can also use different seasonings and sauces in your meals.
Pepper paste, unsweetened sweeteners, olive oil, macadamia oil, and grapeseed oil may also be used.
The above five rules are the basis of the 4HB meal plan. Here are two other factors that will contribute to your fat loss and muscle gain:
Nutraceuticals are supplements that you can add to the diet to give you more energy, improve your immune system,  cholesterol, and other benefits. PAGG is a nutraceutical that can help you in your weight loss and muscle gain.
This supplement consists of 20 or 25 milligrams of policosanol, which is a plant extract to lower cholesterol, 100 to 130 milligrams of alpha lipoic acid, an antioxidant that will prevent your body from storing carbohydrates in fat cells, 325 milligrams of green tea flavanols also known as EGCG and at least 200 milligrams of garlic extract, which prevents fat recovery, and coats cholesterol.
It is recommended that you take this supplement before each meal and before bed. You should take it six days a week and stop taking it for a week every two months.
While using this supplement, make sure you maintain your optimal levels of B-complex vitamins.
Consult a doctor if you have any health problem or taking any medicine, especially anticoagulants. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, do not take PAGG.
 Scientific research has found that the body burns more energy when subjected to cold temperatures.
One option is to put an ice pack in your upper trapezius muscle area or behind the neck for about twenty minutes every morning. A second option is to drink at least 500 ml of ice water as soon as you wake up, before eating anything else.
You should then have breakfast no more than half an hour later. The third option is to take icy baths for 5 to 10 minutes in the morning or before bed.
The fourth option is the most extreme: you will need to sit in an ice bath for 20 minutes.
Cold baths have numerous benefits, including the release of fatty acids, an increase in adiponectin, stimulation of thermogenesis, improvement of your immune system and an 
Getting Stronger And Building Muscles
The next step is to learn how to gain muscle, which will help keep the fat away and make you feel better. For this, we present some exercises that you can do:
 balancing with kettlebell done with two hands is one of the best exercises you can do to gain muscle. It is, in fact, the only exercise you need to produce drastic changes.
To properly balance the kettlebell, stand with your feet at a distance of approximately 30 cm (12 in) from each other, and with your fingers pointed slightly outward.
Keep your shoulders back, start swinging backward with the kettlebell while making a movement as if you would sit in a chair.
Hold your shoulders back and push your hips forward as you squeeze your buttocks. As you move forward, the thrust and weight of the kettlebell will push your arms, creating a swing.
 These exercises are designed to help you get in shape and improve your posture quickly and easily.
Exercise A
Make 10 sets each with thirteen reps and as much weight as you can, except for swings with the kettlebell. For the kettlebell, make 20 to 25 swings. Repeat the entire circuit twice.
This series has different repetitions for each exercise, but the whole circuit must be repeated twice.
 The abdominals are probably the most coveted muscle group, especially for men. Here are two moves you can do to set your abdominal muscles.
The myotatic abdomens use their fully extended positioning and their stretch reflex to create a strong contraction. To perform these sit-ups, you need a Bosu, a Swiss ball or a pile of firm cushions.
You want to position yourself on the ball or on the cushions by sitting as close to the ground as possible.
Begin with your arms stretched over your head as high as possible; Keep your arms behind or close to your ears throughout the exercise.
Then lower yourself slowly for four seconds until your fingers touch the ground, all the while trying to keep your hands off the ball. Stop at this position for two seconds, attempting the maximum elongation.
Climb up slowly and stop at the top, in full contraction position for another two seconds. Do a total of 10 reps.
After completing them, add weight to your hands, but women should not exceed 5 kg in weight.
The “cat vomit” exercise will contract your abdomen inward. Instead of working the vertical muscles in your abdomen like the myotatic abdominal, this exercise works the horizontal muscles known as transverse abdominal muscles (TAM).
To do this, stay on all fours and keep your eyes focused directly on your head or slightly forward. Do not arch your back or strain your neck.
Then exhale through your mouth until all air is expelled.
Your abdomen should contract with this forced movement. Hold your breath and contract the navel upward toward the spine as much as you can, aiming for 8 to 12 seconds. Take a deep breath through your nose after holding your breath.
Do a breathing cycle as rest and then do 10 repetitions of this exercise
When it comes to the 4HB plan exercises, it is important to remember that extrapolating your EMD is risky and pointless.
Improving Your Sex Life
The 4HB plan is not just about your weight and your muscles. The purpose of the plan is to reinvent your life so that you become a better person overall. For this reason, improving your sexual performance is important.
Some women say they have never had an orgasm while others say 
.
The goal here is for you to have an orgasm through manual stimulation or intercourse, or for you to be able to give a woman an orgasm through these methods.
A woman first needs to feel comfortable with her own sexuality and what she likes in bed. If a woman does not masturbate regularly, it will be difficult to facilitate orgasm.
If you are one of these women, you should start exploring your body for five minutes before bed or when you wake up. You will not be able to enjoy orgasm as a partner until you can enjoy one on your own.
Regarding positions that increase pleasure and induce orgasm, the penetration angle is important.
By changing the angle at which the penis penetrates the vagina, you can ensure that the head of the penis contacts the female G-spot, which lies 2.5 to 5cm 
, at the top.
If a man inserts his index finger to the second joint (palm up) and makes a move up and back, as if he were calling someone, the fingertip should touch a spongy tissue.
That is the G spot. Change the penetration angle so that the penis head has a better chance of coming into contact with that area.
Similarly, you can change the applied pressure during sex to facilitate female orgasms. Increasing the force will allow the male pelvic bone to be in direct contact with the clitoris. That will lead to increased pleasure for the woman. Here are some positions that facilitate female orgasm:
This contact should last for exactly 15 minutes. Man, start by separating the lips and hold the clitoris with the right thumb, keeping the prepuce of clitoris upwards.
Place your left hand under her butt, two fingers under each buttock, with the thumb at the base of the vagina.
This will work as a support and help the woman relax. Imagine that you are looking directly at the clitoris in the middle of her legs, with the top of the clitoris at the 12 o’clock position.
Find the position 1 hour – ideally a small flap or pocket between the hood and the clitoris – with the index finger on your right hand and start stroking using the lightest possible touch, with a movement around the region of about 1.5 mm
Use a consistent speed for two or three minutes before varying the speed.
That will cause her to orgasm.
 Testosterone is the male sex hormone produced in the testicles. Some men have low amounts of testosterone for many reasons.
That is usually treated with medicines, but it need not be so. There are two different methods for you to improve your testosterone levels without medications.
The first is for your long-term testosterone levels. Take two capsules of cod liver oil with butterfat rich in vitamins. Take 3,000 to 5,000 IU of vitamin D when you wake up and before bedtime (until you reach blood levels of 55ng / ml.)
Take short 10-minute ice baths when you wake up and before bedtime. You can also eat three nuts when you wake up and before bed.
The second method is for the short term. Consume at least 800 milligrams of cholesterol three hours before bed the night before sex.
That works because testosterone is derived from cholesterol, 
. Also, eat four horse nuts, 20 raw almonds and two capsules of cod liver oil and butter, four hours before sex.
Improving Your Performance In Physical Activities
The next step is to reinvent yourself, focusing on improving your performance in physical activities.
 To improve your vertical jump, you should do the workouts prepared by NFL coach Joe DeFranco.
Begin by making ten conventional jumping jacks, ten with forward arms, five steps backwards on each side of your body, five steps to the side on each side, ten full leg swings, and twenty seconds of jump rope, landing on the front part of your feet and straight legs, as fast as possible.
Once you complete these exercises, you can measure your vertical jump base distance and save your results.
To improve the initial average, you must first change the way you jump. You need to use your shoulders and upper body strength to pull back.
You should also leave your arms at the highest point without pulling them back. Narrowing your squatting position can also help you improve your heel.
The tension in the hip flexor muscles can also be a problem to improve vertical jumping. Stretch your flexor muscles using static stretching 30 seconds before your jump; Hold the position for 30 seconds.
 Start with a warm-up: jump rope for 18 meters (60 feet) twice, six reps backward on both sides of the body, 18 meters backpedaling twice, 18 meters semi-squatting with a lateral pass.
Continue the procedure with stretching and muscle activation: 10 roll-overs with legs apart, 10 hip circles on the move 4 pads and 10 alternating pads.
These exercises should be followed by 
: 20 seconds of jump with plantar flexion and two sessions of 5 seconds of normal squatting with jumping.
To start improving your speed, correct your starting position. Place your right hand down and your left leg forward. Keep your left foot about 30cm behind the finish line, then touch your right toes at the back of your left heel.
Bend and bring your right hand in front of the line with your index finger, middle finger and thumb together. Bend your right arm at a 90-degree angle.
Boost and look at the first step with your back leg to land almost 1m ( 3ft) from the toes of your front foot. When running, keep your chin down and do not look up.
Improving Your Sleep
If it takes a long time to fall asleep, this is considered early insomnia. If you wake up several times during the night, this is called intermediate insomnia.
If you wake up too soon and cannot go back to sleep, you have terminal insomnia.
Because it is very hard for someone to assess their own sleep quality and understand what is actually happening, it may be necessary to have some outside help, such as using a sleep monitor with a variety of functions.
Some important points about having a good night of sleep are:
 Whether or not you get a good night’s sleep for eight or ten hours depends on the relationship between your REM sleep and your total sleep.
If you have high percentages of REM sleep, you feel more rested. You can increase your REM percentage by waking up for five minutes approximately four and a half hours after sleeping.
You can also increase your REM sleep percentage by taking huperzine A thirty minutes before bed.
 If you have a high percentage of deep sleep, you will perform better the next day. Be careful about your wine consumption: drinking more than two glasses of wine in the four hours before bedtime can decrease your percentage of deep sleep.
You can also find the ideal temperature for your room. On average, you’ll want your room to register somewhere between 19 to 21 degrees Celsius.
You can also make great meals based on protein and fat four hours before bed to improve your sleep. Light therapy can also improve the quality of sleep.
Insulated movements performed before bedtime as well as a cold bath an hour before.

The 4 Hour Body Quotes
Final Notes
4HB’s plan is incredibly simple and can fix almost every aspect of your life if you dedicate enough to the process.
The plan is somewhat restricted and may take some time for you to adjust to it, however, if you commit, you will achieve the results you are looking for.
The sheer amount of scientific research used in the different aspects of the plan and the fact that the creator himself made personal experiments puts this plan into a different class when compared to standard diets and exercise plans.
The downside of this plan is that either you do everything or nothing. You cannot choose to follow just one part of the diet and expect it to be successful.
Another downside is that the plan asks you for too many tests to monitor your progress. These tests cost money and are not available to everyone.
Finally, this plan was created so that you would only fail if you drop the ball. Follow the Tim Ferriss method and reap the rewards of a healthier life."

You think that you need a motivational speaker to get yourself motivated?
Jeff Haden is here to burst your bubble: you believe in a myth, he says.
Who Should Read “The Motivation Myth”? And Why?
If you are a fan of 
, then be sure to check Haden’s book out for quite a few counterintuitive advices.
The most important among them: motivation is not merely the precondition for success; it’s also its result; and it’s not that easy to separate the two as most of the other books do.
To quote Dr. Dan Reardon, the co-founder of FitnessGenes, “a must read for all entrepreneurs, company executives, managers, parents, coaches, and wellbeing hackers.”

“The Motivation Myth PDF Summary”
Introduction: You Can Do—and 
—So Much More Than You Think
Quick: what do the Philadelphia 76ers and Jeff Haden have in common?
The process.
Of course it’s not funny!
But that’s only because you haven’t read 
.
If we are forced to summarize it in one word, then “process” is definitely the one we’ll choose. As Jeff Haden explains in the “Introduction,” the difference between successful/happy people and the rest of us is because the former understand both success and happiness as processes, not moments.
In other words, it’s not about the finish line and the gold medal – it’s about the race; or, to use a Joseph Campbell quote, “the goal of the journey is the journey itself.”
“When you consistently do the right things,” writes Haden, “success is predictable. Success is inevitable. You just can’t think about it too much. No obsessing allowed.”
But let’s see how this process works in Jeff Haden’s understanding.
Chapter 1: Motivation Is Not the Spark
Haden begins his book by taking a swipe at 
’ extremely popular book, 
.
If you remember well, one of the key moments of that seminar is the “hot coals” walk, which Robbins describes as “a symbolic experience that proves if you can make it through the fire, you can make it through anything.”
It sure sounds great – and not only because it reminds us of 
. After all, fire-walking should give you confidence and motivation – just enough to awake that sleeping giant of potential within you.
The problem?
It doesn’t work that way.
Simply put, motivation is never something that can be initiated via a one-off event; and even fire-walking is just that.
You need much more than that to get motivated. Fire-walking or a great motivational speech rile you up for a few hours, but you wake up the next day no different than the day before.
Haden uncovers the deeper problem:
In a nutshell, motivation stems from success and fuels more success; consequently, the only thing you need to succeed is just one small victory to get a head start.
Then – just follow the loop.
Chapter 2: The Greater Your Focus, the Lower Your Chances of Success
If you want to reach a goal, you shouldn’t focus on reaching it.
You should set it alright, but one of the worst mistakes you can do is keeping your goal in mind all the time; that’s discouraging.
And it has countereffects: it stimulates you to live much more in your dreamworld than in reality; and you need to do some work in your real life if you want to reach your goals while you’re alive.
So, once you set your goal, forget about it! This unleashes the power of feedback, which works sweet as a mediator in the self-reinforcing loop of Success → Motivation → More Success → More Motivation → More Success…
How does this work in practice?
Say that you want to earn a few more friends; set that goal and now forget about it for it will work against you.
Next, follow these simple seven steps:
1. Don’t talk a lot;
2. Don’t blame;
3. Don’t try to impress;
4. Don’t interrupt;
5. Don’t control;
6. Don’t preach; and
7. Don’t dwell on the past.
That’s it.
Chapter 3: Your Goal Must Always Choose Your Process
Once you know what your goal is, the process chooses itself:
How to create a successful process?
It’s easy – all you need to do is just follow these 8 steps:
1. Set your goal;
2. Set aside decision anxiety and choose a reasonably promising routine;
3. If necessary, customize your process to be extremely specific;
4. Rework your schedule;
5. Map out your daily plan;
6. Work the process;
7. Fix your schedule problems; and
8. Your results may vary, so adapt accordingly.
Sounds too theoretical?
Haden offers a sample plan, one which will help you lose ten pounds in thirty days:
1. Start with a fast day;
2. Exercise first thing every morning;
3. Eat four almonds fifteen minutes before every meal;
4. Drink a glass of water right before every meal;
5. Always stop eating the moment you start to feel full;
6. Don’t eat anything white;
7. Make sure every meal is healthy;
8. Toss in a snack;
9. Burn about five hundred extra calories a day;
10. Cheat wisely;
11. Keep a food journal;
12. Check off each step in the process.
Chapter 4: Happiness Comes to Serial Achievers
In the fourth chapter of his book, Haden teaches his readers how to choose an appropriate goal and why choosing the right one can transform you into a serial achiever.
And serial achievers are usually happy because happiness “requires evenly balancing your multiple nonnegotiable goals, blending in a negotiable goal where appropriate… and never, ever forgetting to self-evaluate along the way to ensure the balance never gets out of whack.”
That’s why the best goals are usually the ones which solve your current problems; and they all fit well within Maslow’s pyramid.
In other words, “if you are in financial straits or relatively poor physical condition, your goal must help you overcome that challenge.”
Everything else will make you unhappy; you can’t climb Mount Kilimanjaro if your physical condition doesn’t allow you to do that; you need to set another goal before that one: getting back into shape.
Chapter 4.5: Wishing and Hoping Is the Most Unrealistic Approach of All
Most of the books you’ve read about motivation and accomplishing your goals are 
: just imagine your goal and the whole universe will work in your favor.
You don’t need Haden to tell you that this would never work.
For the simple reason that, if everyone does that, then how will everybody’s wish come true?
Chapter 5: To Gain Incredible Willpower… Need Less Willpower
Time for a few more plans: one which will help you have the most productive day ever, another the most productive week in your life, and a third one the most productive mindset ever.
And a fourth one to explain the title of the chapter.
The steps, you ask?
Here they are!
1. Let everyone know you won’t be available;
2. Decide how long you will work;
3. Totally commit to how long you decided to work;
4. Start your EPD at an unusual time;
5. Delay and space out your rewards;
6. Refuel before you think you need to refuel;
7. Take productive breaks, not relaxation breaks;
8. Take your breaks at a counterintuitive moment;
9. Don’t stop until you’re done—even if finishing takes longer than expected.
1. Every Sunday, map out your week;
2. Actively block out task time;
3. Follow a realistic to-do list;
4. Default to thirty-minute meetings;
5. Stop multitasking;
6. Obsess about leveraging ‘edge’ time;
7. Track your time;
8. Be thoughtful about lunch;
9. Protect your family time;
10. Start every day right.
1. Stop making excuses for doing less;
2. Stop letting disapproval, or even scorn, stand in your way;
3. Stop letting fear hold you back;
4. Stop waiting for inspiration;
5. Stop turning down the help you need;
6. Stop stopping.
1. Eliminate as many choices as possible;
2. Make decisions tonight so you won’t need to make them tomorrow;
3. 
;
4. Refuel often;
5. Create reminders of your long-term goals;
6. Remove temptation altogether.
Chapter 5.5: One Question Provides Nearly Every Answer
In the second intermezzo of the book, Jeff Haden reminds us of 
 and how it is related to his goal: “Will this help Southwest be the lowest-cost provider?”
Since Kelleher’s plan was to achieve exactly that, then this is the only question which matters.
Use it yourself, in the modified version that suits the goal you’ve chosen: “Will this help me reach my goal?”
If the answer is yes – then do it; if the answer is no – then don’t do it.
Chapter 6: Why Work Smarter When You Can Work Your Number?
With 
, you can achieve more with less of an effort. 
Haden is not even interested in giving you that option: we learn through trial and error, and you need to be aware whenever you start doing something that there’s always the risk that you’ll fail.
However, the more you fail, the higher the chance that you’ll succeed.
You miss 100% of the shots you don’t make, said once Wayne Gretzky.
Well, that’s one of the greatest lessons you’ll ever learn in your life.
Chapter 7: You Don’t Need a Coach; You Need a Pro
“Want to get great at something?” asked once Atul Gawande in 
. “Get a coach.”
Despite the title, Jeff Haden shares much the same opinion. What he doesn’t like – and doesn’t suggest you to get – are motivational coaches.
You need someone who is experienced in an area and who knows what you are doing; not someone whose only expertise is to brand motivation-practices which work for nobody.
Pick your pro/coach based on your goal; not based on the number of books he/she has sold or the number of people who say they’ve been motivated by him/her.
And once you do choose your pro – connect with him; sooner or later, you’ll start becoming him.
Chapter 8: Do More by Doing Less
Doing more doesn’t mean accepting everything that’s on the table; more often than not, it means saying “no;” that’s what’s hidden beneath the somewhat paradoxical title of this chapter.
Doing more is a process which starts with eliminating everything that you don’t need to do. Whether it’s a permission, report, or sign-off – one should do it.
Then “fire” one of your friends: Jim Rohn says that you are the average of the five people you spend most of your time with.
Next, move on to cutting one expense and dropping one personal commitment.
After you manage to streamline your lunch and do away with a full category of decisions, suddenly you’ll feel a lot freer.
Because – one plus one plus one… well, you get the point.
Chapter 9: The Bottom Line
Since this is the conclusion and what 
is all about, we’ll let Haden speak for himself here:
Key Lessons from “The Motivation Myth”
1.      Motivation Is Not a Spark – It’s a Result
2.      The Feedback Loop
3.      Becoming Feels Wonderful Because You’ve Earned It
Motivation Is Not a Spark – It’s a Result
They’ll tell you that you need to watch motivation videos to inspire yourself; they’ll tell you that it’s a nice idea to do something akin to walking on fire to tap into the potential you naturally have.
What they don’t tell you is that motivation is much more than a one-off event: it’s a result; it’s, even more, a stream of results; and success is a process.
You don’t get motivated because you’ve done something or heard something once; the next day you wake up feeling no different.
You get motivated because you do something continually.
And you do it well.
The Feedback Loop
Basically, motivation is not merely the prerequisite for success; it’s also its corollary; together, they form a self-reinforcing feedback loop which looks something like this: Success → Motivation → More Success → More Motivation → More Success…
The only thing you need to start?
A plan.
And a small victory.
 Feels Wonderful Because You’ve Earned It
“The one thing I truly loved about being a pro cyclist was the process,” once Lance Armstrong said to Jeff Haden. “Not the accolades, not the money, not the podium… I miss the process of getting to the point where you can stand on that top step
”
And then he went on: “I miss the hours spent alone and suffering and working to get to the point where I could win. I loved the process. I loved all the thinking, all the collaborating, all the planning and effort and working with great people. I feel like I got paid to do the races, meet sponsor obligations… That’s what they paid me for. I would have trained for free.
I don’t really miss the result. I miss the work.”
And that’s the main point of Haden’s book: 
 feels wonderful because you’ve earned it.

Who Should Read “Great at Work”? And Why?
A management professor at the University of California, Morten T. Hansen is probably best known as the co-author (with the ever-great Jim Collins) of 
, widely considered one of the greatest books on how to build a successful company in a dynamic, unpredictable and tumultuous age such as the 21

“Great at Work PDF Summary”
Morten Hansen is not only a co-author of 
 but also sort of a protégé of Jim Collins; so, no surprises when it comes to the methodology behind this book: 
tries to give a simple answer to a complicated question via an extensive, wide-ranging study.
The question: 
Why do some people perform great at work while others don’t?
The study:
200 published academic articles; in-depth interviews with 120 professionals and a survey study of 5,000 managers and employees, representing 15 industry sectors and 22 job functions.
The results:
The difference between the superstars and their peers are seven “work smart” practices:
: “select a tiny set of priorities and make huge efforts in those chosen areas;”
: “focus on creating value, not just reaching preset goals;”
: “eschew mindless repetition in favor of better skills practice;”
: “seek roles that match your passion with a strong sense of purpose;”
: “shrewdly deploy influence tactics to gain the support of others;”
: “cut back on wasteful team meetings, and make sure that the ones you do attend spark vigorous debate;”
: “carefully pick which cross-unit projects to get involved in, and say no to less productive ones.”
The first four practices relate to mastering your own work; the latter three to mastering working with others.
Hansen explains each of them in the rest of the book.
Part I: Mastering Your Own Work
“The conventional wisdom,” reminds us Hansen, “states that people who work harder and take on more responsibilities accomplish more and perform better.”
The data, however, doesn’t support this view:
As you can see from the table above, managers who “do less, then obsess” perform a whopping 25 percentage points (on average) better than those who perform more, and then stress.
According to Hansen, because of this, this strategy is 
 most potent practice among the seven discussed in the book.
The problem is that 
results in two traps:
• The 
, aka taking on many tasks and being unable to allocate enough attention to each;
• The 
, “the energy required to manage the interrelationship between tasks leads people to waste time and execute poorly.”
If you want to implement the “do less, then obsess” strategy in practice, then use these three ways:
• 
: shave away unnecessary tasks and focus on the remaining ones;
• 
: set clear rules beforehand which will ensure that you’ll never procrastinate (e.g., don’t allow yourself to check your email for certain periods of time);
• 
: put limits; when your to-do list looks too much, it probably is; explain to your boss that accepting any other assignment will affect your performance; he/she will understand.
The more hours you work, the better you perform.
50 hours a week is just enough; counterintuitively, anything more will impede progress and performance; so, redesign your work.
You should rarely work more than 50 hours a week, aka about 8 hours for 6 days; according to Hansen’s study, sometimes, working up to 65 hours has some benefits, but just slight; working more than 65 hours is actually detrimental.
Instead of extending your workday, it’s much better to redesign it.
There are five ways you can do this:
• 
: get rid of activities of little value;
• 
: increase activities of high value;
• 
: create new activities of this latter kind; 
• 
: improve quality;
• 
: do some activities more efficiently.
As Malcolm Gladwell taught us in 
, 10,000 hours of practice is all you need to master a particular discipline; repetition is the mother of learning – says 
.
Hansen’s conclusion:
In other words, it’s not the number of hours that matters; it’s the quality of practice; it’s not 
, but merely 
.
Instead of the 10,000-hour rule, adhere to the Learning Loop rule; namely, focus on the quality of iterations and not the sheer number of them.
This is how the basic steps in a Learning Loop look like:
The reason why people believe that repetition is the mother of learning is that most of the studies in deliberate practice have treated areas such as music, chess, sports – all of them memory-related.
It’s different in the business world.
Hansen suggests six tactics to implement the learning loop in your job:
: every single day, spend 15 minutes to better one of your skills;
: break your desired skill into daily 
; 
: trace the micro-behaviors;
: solicit brief, informal feedback from your peers;
: conduct small experiments;
: de-automate your routines.
They say that if you do what you love, success will inevitably come your way.
Passion is not enough; you need to match it with a strong sense of purpose; hence the P-squared.
Many people are passionate about what they do; the ones who excel among them excel because they attach a much nobler purpose to their passion.
If you do not feel that you’ve achieved this, you can expand your passion and sense of purpose via these three tactics:
• 
. You don’t need to find another job; you can expand your passion and purpose just by finding a different role in your existing company;
• 
. Passion is the result of several factors – not just taking pleasure in the work; it can also come from your success, social interactions, learning, competence, and creativity. “Expand your circle of passion by tapping into these dimensions,” says Hansen.
• 
.
   ○ Add more value to your activities;
   ○ Pursue personally meaningful activities, regardless of other people’s opinion;
   ○ Pursue activities which have a clear and sound social mission.
Part II: Mastering Working with Others
Just argue rationally for your ideas, explain the wonderful merits of your case, and you’ll undoubtedly overcome all the opposition to your work efforts.
“I’ve learned that people will forget what you said,” wrote once Maya Angelou, “people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” 
Well, Hansen’s study vindicates Angelou: the best performers deploy the 
 maneuver, evoking emotions in individuals whose support they need and tailoring tactics in the face of opposition.
Forceful champions inspire others in one of these three ways:
• They make them excited for tomorrow and angry about today;
• They use striking photos: 
;
• They make people 
 resolute, connecting their day-to-day activities to a grander purpose.
In addition, forceful champions display 
 in at least one of these five ways:
• They stand in the shoes of their opponents;
• They confront them when necessary;
• They make concessions they can live with to appease their opponents;
• They co-opt opponents;
• They mobilize people (see above) to advocate on their behalf.
Meeting fights and disagreements bring about discord which spills over other meetings; that’s why fights should be avoided, and only the best and the brightest should be heard.
Fights are a necessary product of good team debate; follow-up meetings are unnecessary when you fight and unite well enough.
To have a productive fight during a meeting, use one of these five strategies:
• Maximize diversity, not talent
• Make it safe to speak up
• Prod the quiet to speak
• Show up as an advocate, not a salesperson
• Ask nonleading questions.
To improve the unity at the end, try the following:
• Ensure everyone has a voice (being heard creates buy-in)
• Commit, especially when you utterly disagree
• Confront the prima donna
• Sharpen the team goal
• Stop playing office politics and get behind decisions.
The more collaboration, the better.
Actually:
Both overcollaboration and undercollaboration are detrimental to success; to achieve balance, you need disciplined collaboration.
It consists of the following five rules:
• If a collaboration initiative seems questionable, say no; if not – say yes;
• Craft a unifying goal for everybody;
• Reward the collaborating people only for the results – not for the activities;
• Commit everything to the collaboration; if you can’t – then kill it;
• Tailor trust boosters to specific trust problems in the relationship.
Part III: Mastering Your Work-Life
We’ll try to summarize this chapter in three charts, each answering the three questions Hansen posits here.
As you can see, even p-squared worsens work-life balance (by about 4%), and “do less, then obsess” improves it the most (by 26%).
Once again, do less, then obsess is the best strategy to go!
All “smart work” practices improve job satisfaction; unsurprisingly, p-squared the most.
Epilogue
Morten T. Hansen conclusion is pretty straightforward: anyone can become a top performer.
True, effort, talent, and luck all play their parts, but these seven practices statistically have played a more important part than anything else.
In fact, that’s the very first graph in this book, but we decided to put it here so that you understand the importance of these seven practices better:

Coincidentally, Lehrer’s book begins with a recollection of Super Bowl XXXVI, contested by the same two teams and concluded in a much the same manner.
The only differences: the Rams, the Greatest Show on Turf, were the runaway favorites back in 2002 (not that they weren’t favorites this year as well), and Tom Brady was just a back-up QB for the Patriots, expected to be the Hall of Famer that he is now by absolutely no one.
After all, he was the 199
 draft pick (in Round 6!) just two years before that and was deemed to lack “great physical stature and strength” in the 
 draft report.
The report did get one thing right: Brady, it said, excels at decision-making.
As you know full well, the NFL has a way to check 
 with a test: the Wonderlic test.
Brady’s score: 33. 
Not bad, considering that it’s twice as much as Dan Marino (16) and a third more than Brett Favre (22); however, certainly not as good as Ryan Fitzpatrick’s 48 (in 9 minutes) or Jason Maas’ 43!
But why are Brady, Marino, and Favre the record-holders?
Because, says Lehrer, the Wonderlic test is somewhat flawed.
Simply put, it sees decision-making as something done with the rational part of our brains; the truth is, that’s merely half of the truth.
You see, our brain consists of both a limbic (emotional) part and a neo-cortex (logical) segment; and we use both to make a decision.
Let’s see how.
Chapter 2: The Predictions of Dopamine
The reason why Tom Brady is so good at making the right decisions when in the pocket – i.e., when he has to make a decision in two or three seconds – is because in addition to analyzing and remembering thousands of plays before the game, he is also capable of deactivating the part which studied and absorbed them during it.
In a nutshell, that’s the story of making the right decisions.
Contrary to what Plato and Descartes believed and advocated, it isn’t right to always think a decision through; when you need to make a decision in a split second – you should always go with your guts.
You know why?
Because your emotions are genuinely empirical as well; after all, they too have evolved during a period of hundreds of thousands of years.
And you owe your competence to something called “the dopamine feedback system,” which functions by detecting subtle patterns that you’d otherwise fail to notice.
Dopamine neurons “assimilate all the data that we can’t consciously comprehend. And then, once they come up with a set of refined predictions about how the world works, they translate these predictions into emotions.”
This was demonstrated by Antonio Damasio in the 
, popularized in his aptly titled book 
.
In short, thanks to dopamine releases, people pick up the patterns in a rigged game of cards even though they consciously have no idea what the pattern is.
People who suffer from orbitofrontal cortex dysfunctions, however, have problems doing this.
Surprise, surprise:
The orbitofrontal cortex is related to emotions and reward systems in decision-making processes!
Chapter 3: Fooled by a Feeling
But, be aware: your emotional brain is not perfect and, unfortunately, it is programmed in such a manner that if you adhere to its rules too much of the time, it will undoubtedly lead you on the wrong path.
The reason?
There are at least three:
• First of all, as we suggested above, the emotional brain is preprogrammed to see patterns; however, as Taleb taught us well (or at least tried to teach us), it can be easily 
. Gambling streaks or hot hands in basketball are not real: they are just your emotional brain seeing patterns where there are none.
• Secondly, as Tversky and Kahneman showed us, the brain is much more interested in avoiding losses than winning; for the brain, “bad is stronger than good,” because even though winning releases dopamine, losing activates the amygdala which in turn makes you feel fear and anxiety;
• Finally, due to the power of dopamine, the emotional brain always favors short-term rewards and disregards long-term costs; dopamine is fired three or four times the usual amount when you win something unexpectedly; and now you know why you keep gambling even after you’ve lost everything.
In a nutshell, the emotional brain keeps you focused – and sometimes this can be a problem.
Chapter 4: The Uses of Reason
Of course, the neocortex, the rational part of your brain, is here to help.
You see, being focused means ignoring many things which don’t matter and directing all of your energy only on the ones which do.
However, what if you’re focused on the wrong thing? Well, then it’s almost certain that you’ll make not only wrong but the 
 decision.
Think of the last time you panicked about something.
A few things happened inside you, the most important of which was 
: you ignored everything but one thing.
It usually works like this: earthquake = significant threat = I need to run away.
However, your emotional brain is far from correct in this case: you can try to run away from a dog, but you can’t run away from an earthquake.
In cases such as these, in order to think straight – science tells us – you need to regulate your emotions.
How do you do that?
So, in a way, science has vindicated Aristotle who argued, in 
that “the key to cultivating virtue was learning how to manage one’s passions.”
It’s not about getting angry; it’s about getting angry to the right and at the right time.
Chapter 5: Choking on Thought
From Malcolm Gladwell’s essay “
”
– recapitulated as part of our 
 – we learned that choking is the failure of 
 things you’ve otherwise mastered.
Well, that’s the foundational one of the few flaws your rational brain is intrinsically peppered with.
Let’s look at the most important ones:
• The thinking mind works best when working with small amounts of data; you can remember the last seven things someone says, plus or minus two; anything more than that, overburdens your rational brain and inspires it to oversimplify things and, consequently, make mistakes because of it;
• There 
 such thing as TMI: your rational brain makes a decision based on merely small chunks of data and uses everything else to support the initial decision;
• Just as your emotional brain is too constricted, your rational brain is too open: it can’t ignore any information, no matter how irrelevant; that’s why it’s pretty open to suggestions;
• As you have experienced so many times in your life, your rational brain tires easily; 
• Perhaps the strangest thing about your rational brain: it’s illogical. Here’s a great example: would you drive 20 miles to save $5 on a calculator worth $15? You probably would. Now, would you do the same to save $5 on a $125 jacket? You probably won’t. Even though, $5 is $5 either way.
Chapter 6: The Moral Mind
We mentioned Aristotle’s 
 above, one of the foundational books on the moral mind.
What does science have to say about it?
Well, strangely enough, that no matter how much you try, your moral decisions are usually made by the emotional part of your brain; the prefrontal cortex usually provides the reasons for it 
.
What does this mean in a nutshell?
A few things:
• First of all, that data and stats would never work as much as something directly related to your emotions; Paul Slovic, for example, discovered that one photograph of a malnourished child inspired people to give much more money (about twice as much) than a whole poster of very real and frightening facts;
• Statistics have no effect on our moral decisions – they are all about sympathy; in a way, Stalin was right: as far as our brains are concerned, a single death is a tragedy; a million deaths are a statistic.
• Mother Theresa said this better: “If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will;” 
.
• If you can’t see the person you’re unfair to – you will almost certainly have no sympathy for him or her.	
Chapter 7: The Brain is an Argument
The conclusion?
Inside your brain, there’s a constant argument between different parts of it.
But that’s a great thing!
When there is none, then you’re a close-minded person, an ideologue, someone who is capable of rationalizing any fact to fit your own system of beliefs.
Since that’s the worst thing that can happen to you, it’s best to encourage inner discord and try to test your opinions from time to time.
We learn best through trial and error.
Chapter 8: The Poker Hand
Speaking of –
No matter how much you try, you’ll never be able to avoid errors; you’re simply not designed to.
However, you can minimize them by following these simple strategies:
• When you need to make an easy decision, then it’s better to never go with your guts; 
 spend some time reflecting and analyzing; however, don’t overthink it either;
• When you need to make a difficult decision, then the best strategy is to gather all the information you can, absorb it and then forget all about it; make the decision after a while, in a split second, using nothing but your intuition.
Key Lessons from “How We Decide”
1.      Your Brain Consists of Both an Emotional and a Rational Part
2.      You Need Both Your Brain and Your Emotions to Make a Decision
3.      Think Over Easy Decision; for Difficult Ones – Go with Your Guts
Your Brain Consists of Both an Emotional and a Rational Part
Plato and Descartes believed that the reason why we make so many mistakes in our lives when making a decision is that we don’t use our rational selves as much as necessary.
However, science has found out that this is not true: in addition to the neocortex, the limbic brain (which deals with our emotions) plays a large part in our decision-making processes.
Don’t believe us?
Well, people who have suffered injuries in the limbic brain are incapable of making a decision.
You Need Both Your Brain and Your Emotions to Make a Decision
If you use your rational brain too much, then there’s a good chance that you’ll be fooled by irrelevant suggestions or/and you’ll eventually choke.
If, however, you exclusively use your emotional brain, then you might start seeing patterns all around you and start preferring illogical short-term gains despite the long-term price.
The key to making a good decision lies in the balance between the two: regulating your emotions when necessary and letting them run riot when not.
“People who are more rational,” says Benedetto de Martino, “don’t perceive emotion less, they just regulate it better.”
Think Over Easy Decision; for Difficult Ones – Go with Your Guts
When making an easy decision, always prefer the rational part of your brain to your guts.
When making a difficult one, however – to quote Ap Dijksterhuis –

Aphorisms are general statements designed to contain and express the undistorted truth.
And that’s pretty much what this book is all about. 
From a philosophical standpoint, Nassim’s words penetrate deep into our behavioral patterns and point out the inconsistencies.
Without further ado, let’s take a gander at the core principles!
Who Should Read “The Bed of Procrustes”? And Why?
At first, we weren’t quite sure that we understood the message emanating from this book. From the looks of it, it seemed as if Nassim had scattered a bunch of things and quotes without any natural flow. 
But we were wrong.
 is genuine in its entirety, and it covers everything pretty much every aspect of an ordinary person’s life.
Therefore, we wholeheartedly recommend it to the general audience, with a promise of an excellent, and enlightening read. 
About Nassim Nicholas Taleb
 is an acclaimed author and a prominent personality whose work brings to light the elements of randomness, probability, risk-taking, and uncertainty.
Apart from unearthing some misconceptions related to the likelihood of something happening, he also excels as an essayist, scholar, and statistician.
He has received both his bachelor and master degree from the University of Paris; and has a Ph.D. in Management Science.
Nassim is also the author of several best-selling books:
“The Bed of Procrustes PDF Summary”
Procrustes, in Greek mythology, describes a vicious owner living in Attica who was renowned for his unusual hospitality. He kidnapped travelers, took them to his home, fed them, and then invited them to get a good night’s rest in his rather special bed. 
Meanwhile, he was obsessed into making the bed fit the traveler to absolute perfection. Those who were tall, had their legs chopped off, while those who were quite short for his standards, were stretched until there were no imperfections. 
According to some sources, the name of this “generous” host was Damastes. 
In addition to this, you can also find another version of this somewhat mythological tale. In the Pseudo-Apollodorus’s Bibliotheca, Procrustes had two beds, one small and one large. The beds depict the limited knowledge of society and the fear of the unknown.
Once you get into reading, you’ll get the idea of why Nassim uses aphorism to illustrate a point.
Remember aphorisms lose their appeal when explained, so we distill the essential meaning into this summary to make them more digestible.
However, we try not to engage ourselves in explaining the symbolic meaning.
Let’s start with probably the most controversial but dead-on aphorism:
To pick it up from here, he also asserts that education can make the wise one wiser, but the fool very dangerous. 
Ideas are not conceptual thoughts that don’t have predecessors, but a blend of rather incompatible ones. 
We can see clearly that Nassim is very critical of the way we absorb information. 
He also points out that modernity has taken a toll on humanity, and further impugns our capacity to make the world a better place. 
Those who can’t see past their nose tend to conflate religion with a belief-system. The same people who struggle to distinguish between system and free will, claim to be speaking on behalf of society, which is quite ironic.
Nassim even sheds light on procrastination, as a method in which the soul tries to break the chains of imprisonment. But yeah, as it is with most other things, nobody has the temerity to exercise radical transparency, especially not to himself/herself.
How to deal with a liar?
By accepting his/her remarks! That seems like a cruel punishment, but it’s exactly what could turn the tables around.
However, we came to the conclusion that saying “No” is not an easy task, especially when you mean it. 
Bear in mind that: 
People prefer to nurture their shallow sense of self and be successful. 
When it comes to wisdom, society kind of puts it on the same page with academia. In other words, we tend to adopt the same attitude, when these two are under scrutiny.
Nassim also cast light on the fragility of temporary deals, and the permanency of the so-called temporary ones. It kind of portrays humans as inconsistent in their desires, and pretty much restless in their deal-making pursuits.
He goes on by saying:
Well, hatred is not easy to conceal and put it under the carpet.
But, when we find ourselves engaged in some topic, ideas have this magical power to be multiplied and shared openly. 
Society has a hard time defining both success and failure. As oscillating terms, we find it hard to accept an absolute definition and evaluate our efforts based on it. 
One of the key elements towards stoic freedom is the unbreakable urge to refuse being wrapped up in chains. 
However, people have been deluded that the opposite of being a slave, is owning one. 
The slave thing has symbolic meaning because it applies to our devotion towards a certain system without questioning its utterances.
Paying the price for freedom is too much for some people.
Karl Marx even discovered that the best way to control a slave is convincing him that he is an employee. Great analogy and pretty accurate depiction of how the slave-business is conducted – masked as a form of empowerment.
Let’s give thought to happiness, as a concept.
That’s a hell of a thing to say, and only a small portion of the people have the audacity to implement it, thoroughly.
And yes, success is probably the journey from the “hating” to the “hated.”
So, who should we follow, do we need role models, to begin with?
It’s much easier to find anti-models who exhibit behavior you don’t wish to emulate, than people whose actions are in line with your view of the world.
Do we need to apologize for our wrongdoings? All the time, except when you are sincerely wrong. 
If the 20
 century is remembered for its failure to produce a social utopia, the 21
 will be known for its technological demise. 
The true measurement of success is the one that revolves around the concept of time. How much time, effort, and skills are you willing to put in?
Some dress to impress an entire group of people, whilst others do it to impress that single person that means to them.
Whatever you’ve learned on your own, would be the thing that never fades away.
True love merely celebrates the win over the universal and the unconditional over the conditional. 
Universal is protected by the manipulative nature of the human conditioning, and that gives us the impetus to exercise control over our surroundings. 
Randomness, however, is rarely taken into account.
On top of that, friendship or nurturing relationships with other people as a process is pretty much debatable. If you try to find a reason for being friends with someone, you are on the wrong path.
Polite disdain is another word for hatred, embraced by those who believe in high-achievement.
Key Lessons from “The Bed of Procrustes”
1.      The spread of rumors
2.      The power of an apology
3.      Slavery with another name
The spread of rumors
The truth of the matter is that rumors are only valuable when they are debunked or challenged with facts. 
This denial serves as a shield or a bulwark against those who intend to neglect the moral principles of the community. 
When it comes to gossiping and whispers, you are much more likely to fool yourself than others. 
The power of an apology
Do you know that people who have a habit to apologize for everything, only intend to do it again? On the second thought, why would they even try to make amends for their behavior, if they only repeat it once you turn your back?
Ask you can see, every apology should be taken with caution because real words are the ones springing from actions.
Slavery with another name
The main distinction between slaves and tech-geeks is that slaves are fully aware of their imprisonment. To some extent, we are all dragged into this mainstream prison; but there’s a way out.
First and foremost, you have to be sharp and attentive to spot the danger.
Next, you ought to take appropriate follow-up actions.

Quiet Summary,https://blog.12min.com/quiet-summary/,,"5 min read ⌚ 
Have you ever heard the sound of silence?  It’s hard to, in this extremely individualist world. The breathing of a forest or the quiet rehearsal of an artist preparing for an audition tend to get lost in the modern hubbub of phones, TVs, and computers.
Susan Cain provides us with an instruction book on how to cope with introverts. I enjoyed reading this book very much, and I found it very liberating.
The book “Quiet” explains the real power of introverts. How can silence positively affect our way of life? GetNugget’s book summary covers some fundamental aspects of quietness as a tool for happiness and self-satisfaction.
Raise awareness about the importance of Susan Cain’s book. A Large portion of the population identifies themselves as introverts (according to some unofficial statistics – it is 1/3 of the population). Like any other self-help book, it provides its readers with a dose of authority and integrity. To move one step further, you have to understand the difference between “open-minded” and “self-sufficient” people. The first ones, give a lot of importance to speaking, socializing, partying, etc. The other half want to spend a little more time analyzing the world and looking deeply into one’s heart.
Don’t take introverts as some uncreative freaks; they are capable of inventing as well as taking risks, however, for the majority of times they’d rather keep their ideas for themselves. You must be able to look at both worlds, see the wild part of the extroverted world, and the passion from the introvert one. Combine these two to come up with a “deadly” combination. This book summary is one-of-a-kind because it reveals the genuine effect of a peaceful mind.
“Quiet Summary “
Susan Cain is a former Wall Street attorney who made a very bold change, leaving her prosperous job to start a career in writing and psychology. She started out seeking answers to the common problems of professional life – like the fear of public speaking – but her curiosity about human behavior didn’t stop there. A decade of research later her first book, 
, has finally been published.
What’s going on?
‘s purpose is to change the way 
. Research shows that almost half of people are introverts. And yet they tend to get overlooked, overshadowed by the louder extroverts. Cain believes society has a lot to gain from paying attention to the quiet ideas of the introverts.
Cain, herself an introvert, carried out enormous amounts of research in order to give us a better insight into her world. Introversion is an innate personality trait, characterized mostly by preferring to spend time alone; a desire for deep, meaningful conversation; a restricted social life; and a tendency to daydream.
The study of human psychology dates back to ancient times, yet in the 21st century, we are still looking for ways to solve the problems facing introverts. According to Cain, these are some of the biggest challenges they face:
Western culture tends to promote 
 as a fulfilled, successful life.  Until 9/11 we thought we were unbeatable and our society superior to any other. This was the norm for all types of economic sectors, and everyday life too. Individuals acted on this belief, and then came the great crash of 2008.
In 
, Susan Cain compares Western and Eastern ways of thinking, acting, and living. Talking to first- and second-generation Asian immigrants established in the 
., she determined that newcomers to the country are already beating locals in many fields. She believes this is because of the way they approach any scenario, mundane or extraordinary: carefully. Asian schools tend to encourage listening and thinking instead of talking, meaning Asian children grow up with a more sophisticated way of dealing with problems. It builds up their perseverance. Cain believes Americans see them as unequal competitors, in both academic and professional circles.
Unfortunately, academic performance is already affecting the professional work environment, too. People who were in school when the book was being written are now employees. Studies show the Millennial generation lacks basic skills such as literacy or, surprisingly – for a generation described as  ‘digital natives’  – computer knowledge.
 is divided into four chapters:
Cain believes that as we can’t help where we are born, the color of our skin, or our personalities, we should accept who we are and make the best of it. Science can help us slightly by pinpointing our potential personalities from a young age, but without a proper environment to thrive in we may give up hope at some point. That is why leaders have a responsibility to represent the interests of everyone they are in charge of. Sometimes introverts end up as leaders; studies prove their work is just as efficient as their extrovert peers, even though their approach may be different.
Cain suggests we must seek – and find – solutions to help introverts thrive in a world ruled by extroverts. We must give them the right kind of tasks and the right amount of time they need to finish it. But the introverts must make efforts, too, and adapt their behavior by pushing themselves as much as possible.
She believes these are the best ways to involve introverts:
We may not be able to change the way some things work, and it’s not always possible to put an introvert in a job situation that requires an extrovert. But we can take an example from Eleanor Roosevelt or Rosa Parks – both introverts who learned to overcome their fears and speak up for what they believed in. Nature shows us that every species has its own role in this mighty ecosystem, and we cannot judge the role that someone else plays in it.
Since Cain’s book was published in 2012 there have already been big changes made on the issue; the International Day of Introverts celebrated on January 2, is now recognized. The fast-growing digital media offers a vast platform for introverts to make their voice heard too, in their own way.
After all, the most important thing in life is to enjoy it as best we can, so why not give the same opportunity to introverts, too?"

Although not for the first time; we’ve been bombarded with false narratives regarding the status of introverts. 
And yes, we are not perpetuating yet another victim-cult mentality, only raising awareness to help the vast majority of people who struggle to blend in.
Yes, you can make up your mind without being pointed at, as a weirdo.
Who Should Read “Introvert Power”? And Why?
Despite the false information swarming the media that introverts are the minority in Western countries, Laurie managed to unearth the real story.
According to a lot of research and statistics, introverts make up more than half of the population, and they are most-definitely misrepresented.

About Laurie Helgoe
 is an American psychologist personal development coach and an author. 
She was praised and awarded by Publishers Weekly for debunking the myth of introversion and extroversion.
Laurie has also appeared on several TV & Radio Shows.
“Introvert Power PDF Summary”
Many people struggle to blend into society, especially when their form of expression is not in line with the curve of the culture.
America, for example, is probably the world’s richest country in terms of diversity, freedom, opportunities, etc. But is the US shifting its culture with regards to competition, and more importantly attitude?
Probably not, but introversion is no longer taboo, and is no longer regarded as a secondary phenomenon. 
Well, when you dragged into this combative workforce, introverts do feel threatened and uncomfortable.
When introverts sense that someone is trying to break their defensive perimeter, they have three options:
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is embedded in the research methodology that covers the effects of introversion and extroversion. 
The most misleading aspect incorporated in this research was the idea that Introverts make up the minority of modern 
. Approximately, every 1 in 4 is considered to be an Introvert, and another misconception that floats around is that: Introverts are quiet, scared and unwilling to take chances. 
From an early age, we receive schooling regarding social norms, and how to behave. 
This doesn’t necessarily mean that we are compelled to act in a given manner, but more so to capitalize on the extrovert traits.
So, what’s the main issue related to introversion?
They are not so easily understood since they hide most of the stuff inside, and have no urge to show off in front of other people.
According to Laurie, one of the biggest misconceptions regarding introverts is the one that they are anti-social. 
In comparison to extroverts who look for answers on the outside, introverts tend to care about human condition, but inwardly.
For instance, traits that describe a sociopath are not anger and bitterness, but charm showcased outwardly. However, they feel no sympathy toward their intended victims, so it’s more than evident that categorizing introverts as anti-social is utterly preposterous.
After a long and exhausting week, you can finally take some time off on a cold Friday night. You decide to go to the bookstore, pick an exciting novel, recline on the sofa, curl up, enjoy your time and recharge your batteries. 
But on the way there, you bump into a friend who invites you to a party.
Your facial expression reveals that you are not up for the offer, but out of fear of judgment, you accept. Once there, you begin to question your decision and feel how everyone is validating your choice except you. You dread being labeled as some anti-social type of person, even at the expense of your own preferences.
Association is productive, no matter what, they say.
You would much rather have a thoughtful conversion about a book that you’ve read, or just sit in silence contemplating about life. 
However, this choice is not well-received by society. 
Laurie puts it perfectly by stating that: 
And there’s no difference between the sexes, the same is true.
How would you interpret this situation? As a display of loneliness or solitude?
When it comes to friends, we are often told: The more, the better.
Solitude is regarded as a 
. Throughout life, you are encouraged to hang out with people, to expand your network, to nurture family values, to abide by these norms, and never ever deviate from this pathway.
Well, that’s not even kind of close.
Let us expand on why solitude is, by all means, a mystery and a problem to society!
In a competitive culture and workforce, your main asset is knowing what the competition is planning. But how can you come out a winner if your competitors don’t allow you in? 
You would have to make assumptions without any information to 
. 
Now, you can begin to understand why solitude is a great source of power and a pain in the ass to those who want to dominate you.
You can hear it on the news when introverts commit serious crimes and get a lot of public attention. This backlash is later used to demonize introverts and denigrate their self-expression.
However, they fail to mention that perpetrators and sociopaths are externally oriented. They see destruction as a way of dealing with their inner chaos for which they cannot find an antidote.
It stands to reason why most introverts are perceived as aliens; unhinged individuals – walking on eggshells.
But that’s not true!
If you look at sci-fiction movies, aliens are often associated with intruders or unwanted visitors.
So, the only thing an introvert can do is choose between:
– Staying faithful to yourself, and risk being labeled or discarded by society
– Adapt to the social norms, and fall victim to the self-alienation
Which one is the lesser evil?
The strange thing is, more than half of the population are introverts. And people act with disbelief when they hear this.
Inasmuch as we all like to live in one society, and garner the support from our community, it’s hard to maintain a homogeneous mindset.
And we all know that there’s nothing more frightful than an independent thinker.
Case in point, the Russian Revolution. 
And, in the aftermath of the revolution, people witnessed the horrors of the thought that drove their utterances.
Introverts want leeway to make up their own minds, but they often fell into disfavor which further crumbles their outward appearance.
They are not prompted but forced to act in a way that is deemed suitable by the so-called majority, which is utter nonsense.
The paradox is presented as a clash between the desire and death model.
Desire or urge, when appropriately initiated, can’t be stopped, and it propels itself. 
The holding capacity or the ability to withstand pressure and still work your way through life is the epitome of introversion.
So, what’s the step-by-step process, let’s dig in:
It may not come as a shock to you, but introverts are much more in tune with the intrinsic qualities of oneself.
And yes, if you are an introvert, you have the right to back down and not follow the norms imposed upon you. Escaping can be difficult, but it’s also expedient, and you’ll rarely have other option to maintain your comfort.
According to the desire-based model, there are several questions worth answering:
It may seem strange, but introverts do find a lot of support in being around animals and enjoying nature. Sometimes, it is for the better to avoid human interactions altogether, for the sake of preserving your inner peace.
They won’t start off a conversation with some meaningless pickup line, or simply to fill in the void. They would much rather be engrossed in a dialogue by sharing something meaningful that could actually make a difference.
If you tone it down, you might listen to what introverts are saying, even when their lips are not moving. 
Ann Landers makes a point by saying the following thing:
And yes, many people feel reluctant to avow their anti-party sentiment, mostly out of fear. 
In all honesty, it’s hard for some extroverts to understand how overwhelming a party can be to introverts. If you recall similar situations, you know how hard you’ve tried to make them stay a bit longer, but you weren’t able to make them love the noisy gathering.
As an introvert, you should learn to say “No,” and stand your ground.
Some introverts have a hard time working with many people and being deprived of 
. Then again, you can’t control the company’s policies, but being a part of an environment that is too clamorous can impede your creativity and make you less productive.
With that said, the corporate environment is rarely if ever, adjusted to them.
And most importantly, introverts always blame themselves and internalize their problems. 
Key Lessons from “Introvert Power”
1.      Get right into the fight
2.      Don’t follow the self-alienation mentality
3.      Capitalize on introversion
Get right into the fight
Well, we are not advising you to throw fists at people for not understanding your position. 
We are merely implying that you don’t have to subdue your basic instincts in order to fit into a certain community.
Get into the right shape of mind and fight to preserve your peace.
Don’t follow the self-alienation mentality
What do we mean by that?
If at some point, you decide to throw away your desires, and simply adapt to the environment, you’ll only activate the self-alienation process.
It doesn’t work to your benefit and only makes you miserable.
Capitalize on introversion
Despite what society says – introverts are immensely creative. 
Don’t squander this opportunity by feeling guilty for your desire to remain in solitude. 
Follow your passion, and if something doesn’t work for you, just abandon it!

“The Dichotomy of Leadership PDF Summary”
If you’ve already read 
, then you already know how difficult it is to be a good leader. It’s not merely about owning your mistakes (which is, nevertheless, difficult and a big part of it); but, it’s also about balance. 
And a lot of it!
A good leader must be – Jocko Willink and Leif Babin pointed out explicitly in the conclusion of their most celebrated book:
Well, this is exactly what 
is all about.
Its goal is to go deeper beneath the dichotomies listed above, so as to “help leaders overcome the struggle through examples of how to find the right balance in leadership – to moderate the idea of leading from the extremes and focus on maintaining balance – within teams, among peers, and both up and down the chain of command.” 
The book is divided into 3 parts and contains 12 chapters, each of which examines a single dichotomy, through a memorable example from the battlefield.
However, since this is a summary, we’ll share with you only the principles.
Part I: Balancing People
There are limitless dichotomies in leadership, but none are as difficult and as central as this one: to care deeply about your people (Part I), and yet, at the same time, accept the risks necessary to accomplish the mission (Part II).
In other words, in addition to building strong relationships with your subordinates, you also need to recognize that you are a leader with a mission, aka you have a job to do.
If you care too much about your objectives, you’ll neglect your people; care more about them than is necessary and you’ll compromise the success of the mission.
A good leader always finds a way to drive his team to accomplish the mission without pushing them off a cliff.
If you know your extreme ownership principles well, you should be pretty much aware that this one is the foundation upon all the others are built: effective leaders take ownership of every mistake, and never place blame on anyone else.
But this doesn’t mean that you should make every decision for everyone on your team; that’s called micromanagement and is awful; however, hands-off leadership also doesn’t work, because it usually leads to a cacophony of commands.
Effective leaders always find a balance between these two extremes: 
“With Extreme Ownership,” concludes Willink, “you are responsible for everything in your world. But you can’t make every decision. You have to empower your team to lead, to take ownership. So, you have to give them ownership.” 
Leaders should be neither lenient nor overbearing’ to find the balance, they must learn when it is important for them to hold the line and when they should allow some slack; and then carefully evaluate each situation.
Two things should help you do this: understanding the concept of “leadership capital” and the power of “why.”
The former refers to the “finite amount of power that any leader possesses.” Now, you can expend it foolishly on strategically unimportant matters, or you can smartly allow your people to blow off some steam in some of these less critical areas.
Because you’ll need to exert that power when push comes to shove. And so that you can be sure that others will listen when it really matters – give them a reason to.
The 
.
Another lesson from 
there are no bad teams, only bad leaders. And also – the team always comes before the individual.
When an individual thinks otherwise, then you need to react: underperformers usually just need to be led properly.
However, “when a leader has done everything possible to get an individual up to speed without seeing results, the time has come to let that individual go. Don’t be too quick to fire – but don’t wait too long. Find the balance and hold the line.”
Part II: Balancing the Mission
Hard training is critical to the performance of any team; after all, there’s no growth in the comfort zone. 
Consequently, training must be hard. It should push the team beyond the limits of their day-to-day easy (because learned by heart) tasks and prepare them for greater challenges; all good training focuses on three critical aspects: realism, fundamentals, and repetition.
Training must be realistic. It should push the team – and the leaders, especially – into realistic, uncomfortable situations where they aren’t sure what to do. So, role-play scenarios in which hard decisions must be made immediately. (
)
Training must focus on the fundamentals; often people think they know them and want to skip through them, but the truth is our brain and memory don’t work that way; never skip the fundamentals lest you want to forget them.
And that brings us to the final point: training must be repetitive. Repetition is the mother of learning: 
.
“An aggressive mindset should be the default setting of any leader,” writes Willink in Chapter 6 of 
.
And that’s because an aggressive mind is a proactive mind: it doesn’t mean an angry one or one that loses its temper easily. It merely means one who is trained to react in the best possible way in the worst possible scenario.
Forget your 
: the only aggression which wins – and every single member of the military knows this – is the one directed towards the problem, not towards the people.
However, aggression can devolve into recklessness, especially if you get a case of that strange “disease of victory.”
Never get complacent, no matter how many victories your decisions earn.
Overconfidence is your enemy.
Alexander Pope once wrote:
                                 
.
In other words, when you learn by heart the rules that should guide your steps in a dance, you’ll suddenly feel the full freedom of movement, and walking would feel as easy as flying.
Rules give freedom; however, too much of them, stifle it. 
So, never forget: leading a team is about procedures and processes because discipline gives more freedom; however when it stops doing that – then the procedures probably don’t work.
Accountability is an important tool, but should never be the primary one:
“A reliance on heavy accountability,” concludes the chapter, “consumes the time and focus of the leader and inhibits the trust, growth, and development of subordinates.”
Balance accountability, on the other hand, results in empowerment and educated subordinates. And that’s the goal!
Part III: Balancing Yourself
There’s a reason why you should never allow your subordinates to feel as subordinates: it stifles their creativity and incapacitates them to make a decision when they are expected to; they’d expect that from you.
So, in other words, you should train your subordinates to be latent leaders, because sometimes your job will be to 
.
“Leaders must be willing to listen and follow others,” writes Babin, “regardless of whether they are junior or less experienced. If someone else has a great idea or specific knowledge that puts them in the best position to lead a particular project, a good leader recognizes that it doesn’t matter who gets the credit, only that the mission is accomplished in the most effective manner possible.”
.
Usually, the team who wins is the team who is capable of seeing a little step further into the future. And, obviously, being able to plan ahead is a trait of great leaders.
However, there’s a limit beyond which planning becomes a burden; it’s, more or less, a physical limit. Unless you’re a chess player, you can’t remember a million scenarios; and even if you are, you may forget the one you need when you need it the most, and, thus, lose due to over-preparedness.
The trick is to choose three or four most probable contingencies for each phase and a worst-case scenario and prepare for them.
Everything else is probably just an iteration, and you’ll do just fine when – or even if – that happens.
There’s a difference between being humble and being passive: the latter is one of the worst traits a leader might have and the former – 
. 
In fact, Leif Babin says that is “the most important quality in a leader.” Case in point: SEAL leaders are usually fired not because of unfitness, unsoundness or incompetence – but because of arrogance.
However, the point is not to become humble to a fault, because being 
 humble usually leads to passivity and leaders should be 
passive.
Once again, it’s all about the balance.
“Leaders must be humble enough to listen to new ideas, willing to learn strategic insights, and open to implementing new and better tactics and strategies,” writes Babin. 
“But a leader must also be ready to stand firm when there are clearly unintended consequences that negatively impact the mission and risk harm to the team. “
Naturally, it’s always good to be attentive to details; however, once again, there’s a point after which this attentiveness becomes a liability. 
Just like you should never allow yourself to not see the trees because of the wood, you can’t risk not seeing the wood from the trees.
This is what “focused, but detached” means: you must find a way to analyze the details of every situation, while still not losing the sight of the big picture.
For that’s the only context in which the details really matter.
Afterword
Willink and Babin conclude their exploration of the dichotomies of leadership thus:
Key Lessons from “The Dichotomy of Leadership”
1.      How to Balance Your People
2.      How to Balance Your Mission
3.      How to Balance Yourself
How to Balance Your People
In order to be a good leader, you need to find a great balance between some of the dichotomies of leadership.
The ultimate one concerns the two most important aspects of it: you need to both care about your people and still be willing to put them in risky situations because of your mission.
So as to do this, you need to own your mistakes, but also empower others to make theirs; you need to be resolute, but not overbearing; and you need to know when to mentor and when to fire.
How to Balance Your Mission
Balancing the mission starts before the mission itself – with training. Training must be hard, but also smart; the former is self-explanatory, the latter is based on three vital aspects: realistic situations, foundations, and repetitiveness. 
To balance your mission, you need to be aggressive, not reckless, and disciplined, but not rigid. You also need to hold your people accountable but never hold their hands as well.
You’re a leader, and they expect to be led by you.
How to Balance Yourself
Balancing yourself as a leader is all about staying humbled; humbled doesn’t mean staying passive – it means staying open to suggestions and ideas. In other words, humble leaders also know when it’s best for the team to be followers as well.
Humble leaders are also focused, but never detached; and they know when planning becomes overplanning.

“Triggers PDF Summary”
The crazy traffic that you have to face every day on your way to work. An unexpected call that distracts us from a face-to-face conversation.
Are we really that weak in front of such of triggers?
Written in a conversational tone, Marshall Goldsmith’s book, 
, clarifies plenty of issues related to this.
Marshall Goldsmith’s main approach is that it is in our power to control how we act, even when we have to deal with spontaneous events.
If you haven’t had the chance to read other books by Marshall Goldsmith, let me tell you a few things about him.
He’s a bestselling author, a world-renowned executive coach, one of the 
in the world, and the top-ranked executive coach at the 2013 biennial Thinkers50 ceremony in London.
At the core of Goldsmith’s book, you’ll find the environmental and psychological triggers that can “threaten” us in our daily activities.
As Goldsmith points out, these events are usually the result of unexpected triggers in our environment — people or situations as a stimulus that make us react in a manner opposed to the colleague, partner, parent, or friend we imagine ourselves to be.
We are surrounded by those kinds of triggers, which appear to be relentless and omnipresent – a cake that makes us forget the warnings about sugar content, a song that distracts us from a conversation.
All these modify our behavior in less than a second. The good news is that WE HAVE A CHOICE. We can control them.
And maybe this is the most powerful insight of the book. Goldsmith shows how we can overcome those triggers and make lasting changes.
Marshall’s theory of the overcoming triggers process is the following:
 We are superior planners, but become inferior doers as our environment

: daily self-monitoring, through 6 “active”/engaging questions – questions that measure our effort, not our results:
Goldsmith filled his book with illustrative stories of the most successful chief executives and power brokers in the business world, offering a personal playbook on how to make really meaningful changes in our lives and rebuild our behavior.
Being too used to an environment may become risky and make you vulnerable in front of unexpected triggers. A good example is represented by successful people. Used to winning, they risk mismanaging their emotions when faced with environmental triggers.
How can we prevent a situation like this? Marshall Goldsmith brings us five questions we should all ask ourselves:

and why it sometimes falls through.
It’s packed with information on how to attract customers and what they’re looking for in your product, shop, website, or ad.
 began his journey in marketing after reading Jim Collins’s 
. That book convinced him to switch careers from cartoonist to public speaker, marketing specialist, and author.
BRAINY BUSINESS / THE BRAIN AUDIT
 starts off with a revolutionary idea: “The brain works just like a 
”. And that conveyor belt is waiting for 7 “bags”, or ideas, in order to complete the sale.
“The Brain Audit PDF Summary”
According to Sean D’Souza, to gain the perfect score in a sale you have to be able to interest your client in your products. At the same time, you have to keep them curious and eager to find out more.
And you can do that by creating a “
”. The seller has to create a sense of security within the client, easily done through well-planned testimonials specifically selected to defuse objections.
Let’s go back a little to the 
. These “bags” must be followed, developed and respected in this exact order to achieve your expected result. According to 
the 7 bags are:
When reading 
, you’ll learn how to follow and exploit each bag. You’ll also learn the motivation behind searching the bags in this exact order, from small to big, from problem to complete closure.
In the “Problem chapter,” you’re presented with the idea that our brains calculate every possible outcome of a certain decision in order to keep us alive. That is why
In order to light up the brain, you have to feed it the information it’s trained to notice if it wants to keep you safe.
Here comes the revolutionary idea: despite the fact that most courses and books tell you to highlight the benefits of a product, Sean D’Souza teaches you to underline the PROBLEM, because, after all, benefits are merely solutions.
He provides an excellent example to explain this: a computer problem you didn’t know you had until you’re presented with a solution that fixes it – a slow computer that may present signs of an imminent hard disk crash.
This example can go even further if you think about the fact that we wouldn’t need cell phones if we didn’t know they existed.
D’Souza even analyzes the fact that problems presented first don’t scare the customer because the problem already exists. All you have to do is enhance it in order to highlight a solution to it and future problems that can develop from this initial problem.
Taking this into consideration, we have to isolate a problem if we want to get the message out effectively.
Later in the book, during the “Solution” chapter, you encounter the idea that providing a solution only works if the customer is first presented with a problem. We’re hard-wired to concentrate on the benefits and features, and this will engage your customer.
Our brains respond better to problems simply because this is the natural sequence: first we see the problem, and then the solution. That’s why D’Souza believes “all the solution should do is flip the problem around”, leading to chapter 3 – Target Profile.
Every one of us is different, and we love to believe that we’re unique and special.
When a seller creates a product that targets a certain profile, he includes a lot of people who identify with that specific profile.
The perfect example is that of Anita Roddick, the founder of The Body Shop – a beauty chain that stands out in a market where “beauty products are a dime a dozen” – who found success by appealing to a profile and not a demographic.
A handy tip presented in 
 is the steps to follow in order to create a profile. They are: start with a demographic; choose a real person from that demographic; speak to that person and find out their list of problems regarding your product or service; pick one problem and expand it; and, last but not least, use a real person for feedback.
After you’ve listened to your target audience feedback, reproduce what you understood from it; in other words – 
 to make sure that you’ve understood what you’ve heard.
This book summary will clear the path to a new scientific discovery – you probably receive many messages on a daily basis, but the attention and energy are pointed only to those that matter to you. Follow Sean D’souza tips and make your life easier.
And with this in mind, D’Souza glides into the next chapter – The Trigger. The message that grabs our attention, the one that gives us no option but to respond predictably.
Faced with the problem, solution, and target together, you’re likely to get the trigger if you use the information correctly.
’s book summary indicates that any message starts with the problem. The problem gets the customer’s attention. Then the solution kicks in – The Brain Audit.
To keep the client’s attention, you have to bring up more detailed information about the problem. That gets the customer’s attention all over again.
We seem to have about 6 or 7 main objections for 
 – creating a “bag”. When this bag appears, the Objection bag, the customer is more likely to purchase your product regardless of any obstacle.
As D’Souza says in a footnote, during his presentations he only explains the first 3 bags but is always asked for the entire list. So far we’ve reached bag number 4, objections – the first 3 being a problem, solution, and target and the adjoining trigger.
The final 3 bags play an equally relevant part in 
: testimonials, risk reversal, and uniqueness.

For argument’s sake, the whole right-left thing has nothing to do with politics! It’s a perspective that entails features and personalized decision-making that best describe the thriving culture. 
This culture transforms the society and is entwined with the artistic, sophisticated and creative expression of one’s flair.
It all boils down to the idea that “
” will benefit you because it may evoke an emphatic response to this call.
Do we all have an equal opportunity to excel in this particular realm? – Let’s see how Daniel Pink defines it. 
About Daniel H. Pink 
 truly is a linchpin in the realm of behavioral science and business. 
As the author of 
… he continues to write in a provocative style.
“A Whole New Mind PDF Summary”
No one can deny the fact that our brains are an incredible blend of neurons, dendrites, and axons. The average one is composed of 100 billion cells, each of which is connected and assigned to transmit special signals. 
This process basically controls how we act, move, breathe, think, etc.
Throughout history, people, societies, and physicians regarded the left side as the pivotal one. Let’s puzzle it out a bit. 
According to Daniel, two general misinterpretations are floating around that need to be debunked.
To address the first, you have to realize that followers of the savior perspective hinge on empirical data and scientific evidence to understand the mechanism. It’s a process that induced a transition – from legitimacy to reverence. 
According to them, the right brain merely reflects the noble and benevolent traits of human conditioning. 
With regards to the saboteur position, adherents to this perspective attach weight to the idea that the right side is somehow inferior. 
As a general rule of thumb – you have to understand that both brains are not under your control. You cannot turn on/off the switch and adjust them based on your beliefs. It’s one driving factor, without any inconsistencies. 
If you like to dive deeper into technicality then you should know that:
All of these elements actually are an integral part of the brain, a mechanism that operates as a whole.
An old adage says: 
Many professions such as lawyers, engineers, doctors, are also under scrutiny regarding the functioning of the brain. To label these people, you have to have an aerial perspective of the situation. Peter Drucker came as close as anyone could get and characterized them as 
.
Knowledge workers are people who unlike the docile workforce which relies on physical readiness and endurance to get a job done, earn a living based on the skills learned at school. 
Well, their prowess most definitely is harder to acquire, because it’s predicated on analytical and theoretical thinking.  
In the age of abundance, if you are endowed with valuable knowledge, it’s much easier to distinguish yourself from the herd. Logic, rationality, and functionality would be your main tools to get the ball rolling. However, if their work is not appealing to the eye, few people will be interested in it. 
Just a couple of words more for you to understand the nature of “plenty.”
People’s lives have changed so much in the past century, and in the aftermath of this alteration, the focus has shifted from short-term thinking into the broader context. 
Generating wealth has remained one of the key elements in our everyday lives, but not the only one. 
It’s totally accurate to imply that the number of people trapped into poverty declines consistently over the years. On top of that, abundance as a way of looking at things has helped the less-developed societies to get access to goods and services previously unavailable to them. 
One of them is electricity.
On this quest, Daniel met with a group of people from India who exhibited an enormous amount of talent in computer science, aerospace engineering; you name it. 
In the US, a typical chip designer makes around $7,000 a month, while in India or Russia you can get the same quality and pay no more than $1,000. Thus, knowledge workers are rapidly changing the workforce and add to globalization. 
Outsourcing is becoming an integral part of the modern-day organization, and you should not underestimate the long-term impact of it. 
Next up, Daniel Pink addresses the whole revolution regarding market changes; from the industrial age to the digital era saturated with opportunities!
So, what does this have anything to do with the brain? Insofar as our brains are concerned, societies have built their cultures and cities on the backs of workers (people’s left brains). Nowadays, the emphasis falls on the right side, which embodies more artistic expression and freedom. 
In the conceptual age or the age of abundance, a lot of people ponder the matter of outsourcing the work and transferring the financial burden to lower-wage countries. 
On top of that, students in medical schools are taught to go beyond computer diagnosis and pay attention to the patient’s story. You can interpret it in countless different ways, but that is the consequence of the high-touch & high-concept process that is permeating the Western system. 
The answer lies in the six-sense rule contrived by Daniel that guides the R-Directed aptitudes.
#1 Design
It goes without saying that creating, launching and designing a product is no longer enough. Nowadays, we must strive towards excellence because the markets have shifted from mass oriented to user-centric and exclusive. 
The economic and social struggle has penetrated deep into the behavioral patterns, causing a massive shift in demand. Companies and organizations, in general, must do their best in making their products or services emotionally engaging and pragmatic. 
#2 Story
In a world saturated with information and data, one must try hard not to delude itself. The story you tell and the picture you portray will make a valid argument, or spark a debate that will help you evaluate your ideas.
Somewhere along the line, you’ll be reprimanded or even chastised for making a point.
Nonetheless, you must stay firm in what you believe to be true, and stick to it. Also, you have to advocate for freedom of expression by allowing productive intercourse to take place. 
#3 Symphony
It’s needless to say that the age of abundance requires specialization, above all else. 
What does that mean?
Much of the white-collar work is currently under transition and is steered toward Asia. The rest of it falls under software and depicts the symphony of skills. 
You may be misled into believing that analysis or data-tracking are in highest demand, when actually seeing the big picture, and pushing beyond traditional norms is on a higher scale. 
#4 Empathy
Truthfully, the ability to think, contemplate, figure out solutions is what makes us unique. 
It’s also totally inaccurate to lean on logic, as the only tool at our disposal. In a world filled with contrasts, being analytical isn’t the only solution. 
To thrive in today’s world, you have to put up with many new concepts not tilted toward the extremes. Surely, empathy and the aptitude for forging relationships can be counted among those concepts. 
#5 Play
Well, yeah, we all need to go crazy sometimes and lift the spirits of everyone around us. Games, laughter, playfulness are all necessary elements that could improve the quality of life in general. 
The lightheartedness illustrated here serves a great purpose. 
By no means should your seriousness be met with rebuffs, because there are times when being cold sober counts. Daniel reckons that conflating the idea of playfulness with the conceptual knowledge is probably the best approach.
#6 Meaning
Even third-world countries are starting to reap the benefits of the abundance age.
Living in a material plenty world has taken a toll on societal norms, but has freed millions of people from the everyday struggle for a piece of bread and roof above our heads. 
In other words, we have the power to pursue subtler desires, goals, and spiritual maturity. 
The future of jobs and societal structure will depend on the following three questions. 
Key Lessons from “A Whole New Mind”
1.      The Right-side keeps winning
2.      Transition is not bad
3.      Keep your chin up
The Right-side keeps winning
By now, you probably understand the necessity of mastering the R-Directed aptitudes and their absolute domination in the age of abundance. 
The right side of the brain offers a genuine response to the powerful and emotional urge of the society. It’s a legitimate indicator that shows why the L-Direction is falling behind.
Transition is not bad
Well, we cannot force you to embrace change, but it is something you should do. The strange thing is even if you’ve been dragged into accepting only the left side (unconsciously), the transition will automatically take place. 
The whole world is actually experiencing this change, without any visible instigators to back it up.
Keep your chin up
Well, not all people will easily fit into the Right-Brain category. Nonetheless, you shouldn’t be discouraged in the attempt to find your instinctive freedom.
Just be patient and try to blend into the biological twist.

Our Critical Review
That would be all folks. 
We kind of got the feeling that society can’t do anything about this phenomenon. 
The only thing left for us to do is to accept this transition, wholeheartedly. Well, if that’s the case, then we must become aware of the power emerging as a result of this acceptance."

You may know a lot about the world, but you know almost nothing about yourself.
Carl Gustav Jung is here to help you get to know with the most profound aspects of your personality.
We present you the summary of his testamentary book:
Who Should Read “Man and His Symbols”? And Why?
If you are interested in psychology, 
is a necessary read; especially if you are a beginner, and you want to understand the essence of Jung’s ideas.
Written for the general public, it covers all of the basics and serves as a great introduction to the work of one of the most important intellectuals of the 20
 century.
About Carl G. Jung
 was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, founder of the school of analytical psychology, and one of the most influential intellectuals of the past century.
While working as a research scientist under Eugen Bleuler at the Burghölzli in Zurich, Jung attracted the attention of Sigmund Freud who thought of him as his heir; the Austrian even named Jung the first head of the International Psychoanalytic Association, founded by none other than Freud in 1910.
However, Jung’s research led him away from Freud, and two had a not so amicable rift which deeply scarred Carl Jung and influenced his further thought and beliefs.
Creator of some of the most important concepts in psychology – individuation, archetypes, the collective unconscious, introversion/extraversion, synchronicity – Jung’s work has influenced many different areas of human knowledge, ranging from psychiatry and philosophy to anthropology and literature.
“Man and His Symbols PDF Summary”
Introduction
“The origins of this book are sufficiently unusual to be of interest,” writes John Freeman in the “Introduction” to 
,
“and they bear a direct relation to its contents and what it sets out to do. So, let me tell you just how it came to be written.”
Who is John Freeman, you ask, and how does he know about the origins of Jung’s last book?
Well, you can say that he is directly responsible for its existence.
He was a journalist – also a decorated soldier, a diplomat, and a politician – who worked for the BBC during the middle years of the past century; during this period he was mainly known as the presenter and the interviewer for BBC’s excellent show, 
In 1959, he got to interview Carl Gustav Jung – then in the ninth decade of his life – at the psychiatrist’s home in Zurich. 
Freeman was pretty affected by Jung’s views and overwhelmed by his amicable persona; he left Zurich lamenting the fact that Jung’s theories were seen as being inferior to Sigmund Freud’s at the time.
As far as Freeman was concerned, this was not because the latter were more correct, but because Jung’s were not available in a form which should communicate them to the general public.
So, he tried convincing Jung that he should write such a book; however, Jung was reluctant and firmly denied the need for such an endeavor. 
And then – as you would only expect from a man famous for researching the unconscious – Jung had a dream which convinced him in the opposite.
By this time, however, he was already pretty sick, so 
is authored by both him and a few of his closest collaborators.
And it’s everything Freeman hoped it would be.
Part 1: “Approaching the Unconscious” by Carl G. Jung
The first chapter of 
was written entirely by Jung, and originally in English, one of the very few things Jung ever wrote in the language.
Jung starts his essay by making a distinction between signs and symbols. 
Signs merely denote the objects to which they are attached; trademarks and names of patent medicines are good examples of them. 
Symbols, however, are much more complex, vague and unknown; they are terms, names, or pictures which, even though sometimes familiar from daily life, possess “specific connotations in addition to its conventional and obvious meaning.”
Dreams communicate with us in terms of symbols.
Why?
For the same reason that a stenographer uses shorthand to encode data in a form which can subsequently be decoded; namely, there’s just too much of it all around us, and our unconscious uses shorthand as well.
However, the shorthand of symbols written by our dreams is not exactly easy to understand; 
, but according to Jung he made a few big mistakes.
The biggest one?
Ignoring something Jung calls the collective unconscious.
Jung agrees with Freud that all of us contain two personalities within ourselves; every ancient civilization knew this, referring to the deeper part of us with the word “soul;” today, we call it “psyche” which is basically the same, since “psyche” means “soul” in Greek.
However, Jung goes a step further than Freud.
Yes, he says, we contain two personalities within ourselves, but the unconscious part of us is divided into two as well. 
Freud’s unconscious is Jung’s personal unconscious; and Jung’s collective unconscious is a new term introduced by Jung himself referring to a vessel of images and symbols shared by all human beings.
As opposed to Freud’s, Jung’s psychotherapeutic practice (called Analytical Psychology) usually revolves around a patient’s relationship to the collective unconscious.
As far as Jung is concerned, the problems he is interested in are, more or less, Western problems. 
In other words, most of the other civilizations – especially the Eastern ones – are not as dissociated from their souls (their psyches, their unconscious beings) as are we, the modern Europeans and Americans.
Why?
Because, ever since the Renaissance, we’ve put too much emphasis on our rational selves, and, as a consequence, ignored the irrational.
Since it is not something that can be ignored, our unconscious has come back to haunt us.
Literally.
It bursts into our dreams and forms the shadows that lurk behind us, reminding us constantly of the things we’ve never achieved or the things we want to.
The Western unconscious is darker simply put because, by ignoring it, we’ve disintegrated our very own selves and created a deep chasm in which the meaninglessness of our lives lies buried.
If you want to find some meaning and purpose, then your job is to find, once again, coherence, by first understanding the messages your unconscious sends you through your dreams and then use them as your guiding light.
Jung writes:
Part 2: “Ancient Myth and Modern Man” by Joseph L. Henderson
Joseph L. Henderson begins his essay by commending Carl Gustav Jung’s life-work.
According to him, it is Jung who taught us to not only rediscover our ancient symbolic history but also to think of it in terms of ever-important ever-presence. 
Unlike many other thinkers and philosophers before him who saw in the ancient rituals and images merely primitive beliefs, Jung was right to see something which is buried so deep within the human’s psyche that it always speaks to us in a deep and meaningful manner.
For example, we still celebrate Easter, Christmas, Halloween and many other holidays in a way which is profoundly riddled with symbolism; it is a sad affair that we have forgotten to understand its meaning, since, as Jung has discovered, it is still relevant to us.
Why?
Because, more or less, these images are as real and as vital to us as, say, our hearts and brains; these images are actually organic.
Jung calls them archetypes, and defines them as tendencies to form some representations of a single motif, “representations that can vary a great deal in detail without losing their basic pattern.”
“There are,” Jung writes in the first part, “many representations of the motif of the hostile brethren, but the motif itself remains the same.”
These archetypes are usually dismissed as merely “inherited representations,” but Jung says that it is absurd to link them exclusively to our conscious selves.
If it was so, then they wouldn’t be so bewildering, and we would have easily understood them.
The truth is, he says, that they are collectively-inherited unconscious ideas and patterns which are universally present in individual psyches.
In continuation, Henderson analyzes Jung’s four major archetypes (animus/anime, the self, the shadow, the persona) and four others: 
, the Trickster, Initiation, and Transcendence.
Part 3: “The Process of Individuation” by M.-L. von Franz
Marie-Louise von Franz’s essay “The Process of Individuation” deals more closely with the four major Jungian archetypes and with the different manners in which their interaction contributes to our development.
Individuation, if successful, is precisely that: the process of integration of the innate elements of our personalities (these archetypes) into a well-functioning whole.
It is an innate need for self-realization that leads us to explore and, subsequently, integrate these disowned parts; a failure to do so will result in neuroticism, manifested through psychosis, phobias, or depression.
All of these, if we are to believe Jung, are the result of us not being interested enough to get to know with our deeper selves.
Our inner core is the Self – and not the Ego; the Ego is merely the bridge between our unconscious and the real world; it makes real what the psyche imagines; so, in a nutshell, it is nothing more than the outer side of our psyche.
The Self always has some kind of a purpose; and our Ego, during our lives, has to recognize this purpose and works toward its realization.
Think of this purpose as destiny: as far as Jungians are concerned, you are preprogrammed to become something; self-realization is actually like solving a puzzle: you need to interpret your purpose correctly, and then walk the path toward making it a reality.
Just like knight must face dragons to save the damsel in distress and unite with her, you need to recognize your Shadow (the shameful behavior your Ego wants to stifle) and integrate with the contra-sexual aspect of your personality (Anima/Animus).
Only then your Ego will deflate and make room for your purpose; however, individuation is not narcissism, but the opposite of it.
It’s becoming who you genuinely and 
 are by accepting 
 else.
Part 4: “Symbolism in the Visual Arts” by Aniela Jaffé
Most of the points made by Von Franz in the third part of 
are repeated by Aniela Jaffé in the fourth, this time via an analysis of the history of the visual arts.
Jaffé mentions from the start that, in a way, humans are different from the other species mainly because of their capacity to shape symbols – 
. 
Three symbolic motifs which Jaffé considers central are subsequently analyzed through this essay: the motifs of the stone, the animal, and the circle.
It’s entirely possible that, in the beginning, it wasn’t the Word, but the Stone; millennia ago, humans somehow devised the notion that stones may have some more profound meaning if carved or arraigned; so, they started doing exactly that; because of this, stones may have been the earliest visual representations, the most ancient human symbols.
Soon afterward, humans moved on to drawing and redrawing another important symbolic motif: the animals; in fact, almost all of the cave paintings you know are animal representations.
Why?
Because of the Shadow we talked about above; the animal motif is symbolic of human’s instinctual nature. In other words, early humans realized – of course, not consciously – that they are divided, and that one part of them is still nothing more but a wild animal.
They knew full well that the only way for a society to exist is if everyone tamed his/her own animal; so, in a way, they talked about psychic individuation and integration through images.
The circle is the final motif that Jaffé explores, noting that it is almost universally recognized as a symbol of completeness and wholeness. 
Jung himself thought of the Circle as a representation of the Self-archetype; when it is combined with a Circle (usually the latter is within the former), Analytic Psychologists tend to think of these images as visual representations of our duality – the circle representing our psyche and the square our body.
Ever wondered why modern Western Art is neither realistic nor comprehensible?
Well, according to Jaffé – and Jung, and many other mythologists and anthropologists – it is because of how much Western societies have put an emphasis on our rational beings and because of how much they have ignored the unconscious.
The more they did this, the more modern art came to reflect the obscure, the ambiguous and the hard-to-decipher unconscious as a counterbalance.
In a way, art is not realistic because we are 
 realistic.
Part 5: “Symbols in an Individual Analysis” by Jolande Jacobi
“Other contributors to this book,” writes Jolande Jacobi in the fifth part of 
,
have described the nature of [dream] symbols and the role they play in man’s psychological nature. I wish to show how analysis can aid the individuation process by taking the example of a young engineer, aged 25, whom I shall call Henry.”
And so she does, outlining her attempt to understand the psyche of this young man whose dreams include walls and railings, monks, and visiting a brother as a soldier.
Through careful analysis, Jacobi shows how these dream images uncover a tender introverted soul trapped within a “mother-prison,” simultaneously afraid and willing to tread the path toward independence and self-realization.
Why have these dream images appeared now and not before?
Well, simply put, because previously he never had a job, and his first job was the breaking point because it faced him with a choice: to either leave his home and realize himself or stay trapped forever in his introverted nature.
Fortunately, through the course of several meetings with Jacobi – spanning many months – Henry successfully overcomes his anxieties and fears and is eventually able to leave his home and even marry.
Conclusion: “Science and the Unconscious” by M.-L. von Franz
The conclusion of the book is once again written by M.-L. von Franz.
In it, she tries to outline the scientific foundations for Jung’s theory of the unconscious, making a few quasi-scientific claims but also making an excellent point that our current state of affairs in the exact sciences must change profoundly if we are interested in finding out more about our very own beings.
Unfortunately, half a century later, not much has changed.
Key Lessons from “Man and His Symbols”
1.      You Are Someone You Don’t Know
2.      Embrace Your Shadow and Your Anima/Animus
3.      Western Civilization Has a Serious Problem
You Are Someone You Don’t Know
What Freud and Jung discovered was that something previous generations had taken for granted – namely, our integrity – is not only far from the truth, but is also the reason why we’re unhappy.
Namely, in addition to our conscious and rational part – the one we communicate with and understand well – there is also an unconscious aspect of our being which talks with us through the symbols of our dreams and stories.
These symbols are shared between all humans (they are part of the collective unconscious) and are individualized in the mind of every single human being.
Embrace Your Shadow and Your Anima/Animus
In stories, knights kill dragons and save the damsels in distress; in films, charismatic bandits stop trains and save the girl tied to it by the villain.
Even though it is a different story, the underlying motif is the same, and it is the program which guides us to our self-realization.
The thing that inspires us to be heroes is our Self; the dragon or the train is our Shadow, the repository of all dark and traumatic events our Ego buries far from our sight; and the lady is the Anima (or Animus if you are a woman), the counter-sexual part of our being.
Contrary to many intellectuals before him, Jung thinks that, instead of ignoring them, we should embrace our Shadow and our Anima, because that’s the only way we can grow to become self-realized beings.
Otherwise, we’ll suffer from neurotic conditions.
Western Civilization Has a Serious Problem
Western men are, in general, much more prone to suffering from anxieties and depression.
The reason?
The division between their unconscious and conscious selves is much greater than the division in Eastern societies.
And why is that?
Well, because, since half a millennium ago, we put all our chips on our rational selves and started ignoring everything else.
And the unconscious has come back to haunt us, as can be readily observed in our modern art, which is much more symbolic and less realistic than any other in history.
It’s the Unconscious – striking back!

“Man and His Symbols Quotes”
Our Critical Review
“This book,” says a 
 review “provides a unique opportunity to assess his contribution to the life and thought of our time, for it was also [Jung’s] first attempt to present his life-work in psychology to a non-technical public.”
And it goes on: “What emerges with great clarity from the book is that Jung has done immense service both to psychology as a science and to our general understanding of man in society, by insisting that imaginative life must be taken seriously in its own right, as the most distinctive characteristic of human beings.”And we have nothing to add, save a few words we wrote when we included 
in our list of 
: “Densely illustrated and beautifully written, the book is the best introduction to Jungian psychology, and one of the most influential psychological books ever published.”

Entrepreneurs of tomorrow, lend us your ears:
Richard Branson reveals his way of running things.
.
Who Should Read “The Virgin Way”? And Why?
If you want to become the leader of the future, then Richard Branson is undoubtedly one of your idols; he is just too colorful and vibrant to 
 be.
Unsurprisingly, most of his books share this description; true, none of them is as exceptional and interesting as his first one, his autobiography 
not even its sequel, 
But 
is as close as it gets to being that good.
So, it’s almost a must.
About Richard Branson
 is a British entrepreneur, one of the wealthiest people in the world (worth over $5 billion) and certainly the most colorful and unusual among them.
A high-school dropout, Branson set up a mail-order record business in his teenage years. In 1972, he teamed up with Nik Powell to open a record store, dubbed “Virgin Records,” because he was new at business.
The brand grew rapidly during the next few decades, and currently controls over 400 companies in many different spheres.
In 2000, Branson was knighted for his services to entrepreneurship; two years later, he was voted the 85th Greatest Briton in history and in 2007, one of 
’s Most Influential People in the World.

“The Virgin Way PDF Summary”
Published in 2014, 
 seems to have more subtitles than the Virgin Group has companies: “Everything I Know About Leadership,” “If It’s Not Fun, It’s Not Worth Doing,” “How to Listen, Learn, Laugh, and Lead”…
We chose the last one because that’s how the book is organized inside: four parts, each containing about five chapters, framed between a preface and an epilogue.
However, the other two subtitles should do as well.
In fact, most of the preface Branson dedicates to uncovering “the worst kept secret in entrepreneurship,” aka the second of the three subtitles listed above.
As you know full well, Branson left school when he was sixteen to found his own magazine-publishing company.
The reason why he did this is that the latter was his dream, and the former seemed an obstacle to it.
However, to his surprise, many people follow conventions rather than dreams and always hope that their lives will miraculously change in the future.
The simple point is: if you want to do something, then do it; and don’t look for excuses in the way society is organized or other people; your dreams are your own responsibility.
Achieving them is a four-step process, best summed up in four L-imperatives: listen, learn, laugh, and lead.
Let’s have a look at them. 
Part One – Listen
“I believe,” writes Richard Branson, “that listening is one of the most important skills for any teacher, parent, leader, entrepreneur or, well, just about anyone who has a pulse.”
Branson acquired this skill through the good parenting practice of his mother, who, ever since his earliest days, urged him to interact with people, and banned him from spending too many hours in front of the TV.
This influenced the young Richard to the point that he started carrying with himself a small notebook in which he regularly took notes; sometimes clever sayings, sometimes things said at a meeting or during a casual conversation.
It may have seemed a bit strange at first, but, soon enough, people grew accustomed to the notetaking Branson.
Listening, as far as Branson is concerned, is where it all starts: every great leader was a great listener beforehand.
After all, none of us is smart enough to know everything and many of us have come to some understandings or developed ideas which should be taken note of.
And that’s why listening is so essential.
It’s much different from hearing, which is what you do when you are annoyed by a baby crying on an airplane; you’re merely registering the information and doing nothing with it; however, listening is something else: it’s understanding what that info stands for and what 
should do with it.
In addition, listening is not sitting quietly for 20/30 minutes in front of the person you’re talking to; that may be a good start sometimes, but unless you’re actually absorbing the information, contrary to what other people say, you’re not a great conversationalist, but a great would-be psychiatrist.
The point is to speak 
 people, not speak 
 them.
And that’s the first lesson Branson wants to share with you.
Part Two – Learn
Listening is the foundation of learning.
According to Richard Branson, everyone can be a leader; and, in a way, almost everyone is – in his or her own orbit. Someone is a leader of his family, other of his football team, and yet a third one of his office.
But, as we have told you numerous times, great leaders – 
 – are usually the ones who can be something more than that.
How has Branson achieved it?
Well, first of all – and paradoxically – by learning that the more exceptional he is, the less exceptional he needs to be.
Leaders who don’t want to dine with their subordinates are not leaders – but feudal rulers with antiquated beliefs which will result in their ruin; in fact, as Simon Sinek says, real 
.
This is basically how the Virgin companies function – Branson doesn’t want to present himself as someone precious who is not interested in his employees, but the other way around.
And he does this by always finding new territories for his companies to conquer. That’s, in his opinion, the most important job of any leader: to venture forward into the unknown.
Standing still, in the dynamic age of today, is basically the same as writing your own death’s verdict.
Case in point: Kodak.
In the 1970s, Kodak was an industry giant and the first company of its kind to discover the digital camera. However, its executives didn’t want to embrace this new inventing, fearing that it would mean the end of their business model.
So, instead of further investing in developing digital cameras, Kodak spent large sums of cash into pointing out the flaws of digital cameras.
Other companies used this mistake, and they corrected them.
Kodak filed for bankruptcy in 2012.
Part Three – Laugh
Let us guess:
The first that that comes to your mind in the early hours of the last day of the workweek is a “thank god it’s Friday!” And, just like Brenda Ann Spencer, you too don’t like Mondays (OK, not 
much).
You know what the underlying message of it all is?
You don’t like your job, aka you are on a path of spending a third of your life doing something you don’t want to.
Richard Branson didn’t want to do this – and was willing to pay any price not to repeat the mistake of the majority of the population.
So, he decided to do something he is passionate about and wants to work with people who share this passion.
You know, people who, instead of being grumpy, are actually laughing and enjoying the office parties because they like where they work.
“I believe that hard-wired passion,” writes Branson, “for giving customers… a better work environment or service experience that they can’t find elsewhere is at the very heart of what the Virgin brand and I stand for.”
This is why Branson is always involved in the process of hiring, which he thinks is the one thing you should never delegate.
Even if you are Google and you’re hiring about 4,000 people a year; case in point: Larry Page still insists on having the final word whether someone is fit for his company or not.
Richard Branson is no exception:
The bottom line: CVs don’t matter; people do. 
Part Four – Lead
“When I started out with what was to become Virgin more than four decades ago,” writes Branson, “I genuinely wanted – and still do want to – change people’s lives for the better.”
The Leaders of the Future, according to Branson, are the ones who share this belief of his. You can’t be a good leader if you are only in it for the money; but you can be a great one if your goal is to make a difference, to make the world a more beautiful place for the future generations.
Speaking of – Branson firmly believes in collaboration as a way of achieving this. 
Gone are the times, according to him, when collaboration was deemed detrimental to the successes of an entrepreneur at the market.
Now, it’s the other way around: collaboration is the only key for success.
In fact, Richard Branson reiterates a point many people have made several times during the past few decades (think Isaacson’s 
or Matt Ridley’s 
): nobody has ever operated alone; and great innovators and entrepreneurs are just the last in a long line of collaborators across time.
The future belongs to those who collaborate across space.
Key Lessons from “The Virgin Way”
1.      “You Are Guaranteed to Miss Every Shot You Don’t Take”
2.      “Luck Is What Happens When Preparation Meets Opportunity”
3.      “Great Leaders Are Almost Always Great Simplifiers”
“You Are Guaranteed to Miss Every Shot You Don’t Take”
Richard Branson indicates several times throughout his book that he owes a lot of his success to the parenting methods of his father and mother.
For example, one time, his mum asked his dad to spank him on the backside for not adhering to her orders in Sunday church. His father took to the other room and clapped his hands together to simulate beating.
Branson thinks that he learned an even better lesson when, one day, after an abysmal performance in a cricket match, he returned home depressed and ashamed of his abilities.
“Ricky,” his mother said, “even though we both know that this wasn’t your best performance, you should never forget that you are guaranteed to miss every shot you don’t take.”
Life is an experiment. 
Try everything once. Except incest and folk dancing.
(Even though you can find it in 
, that funny quote is not by Richard Branson, but by Sir Thomas Beecham, the famous conductor).
“Luck Is What Happens When Preparation Meets Opportunity”
Mike Oldfield’s 
was the very first release of Virgin Records, founded in 1972 after Branson realized that he was earning enough money from his record store to realize a childhood dream.
Even though the album was a chart-topping bestseller in the United Kingdom, Richard Branson had problems selling it overseas.
Ahmet Ertegun, the co-founder, and president of Atlantic Records didn’t believe that an all-instrument album would be any kind of success in the United States.
However, he agreed to see what all the fuss was about.
The very day he played the record, William Friedkin, who was filming 
at the time, entered his office.
The rest, as they say, is history – 
.
The moral of the story is in the title of this section. 
The Romans had an even more pithy saying: “fortune favors the bold.” 
Try – and eventually, you’ll get lucky.
“Great Leaders Are Almost Always Great Simplifiers”
As inferred by Richard Branson, companies evolve in much the same manner as people, and leaders should act accordingly.
Startups are all about trying to find your feet – as you know full well, half of the companies don’t even survive this period; so that’s your only goal at the beginning.
The ones who do are like teenagers: they think they know it all and are full of vigor and energy, investing 24 hours a day into something much bigger than anyone can understand; of course, the teenage years come with many mistakes; the point is not to make a fatal one.
Because, if none of the mistakes in a company’s teenage stage is fatal, then the mature stage arrives when as a leader you should be smart enough to correct all of your mistakes.
Even though everything is quiet and well at this point, the mid-life crisis is lurking around the corner and many leaders, at this stage, spend most of their time looking in their rear-view mirrors.
Don’t do that.
Whenever you can, find the time to listen, learn, and laugh – and you’ll be able to lead better than most!

“The Virgin Way Quotes”
Our Critical Review
Described as “a book on leadership from someone who has never read a book on leadership in his life,” 
doesn’t contain everything Branson knows about leadership and is a bit of a letdown.
Not because it’s a bad one, but because its author is Richard Branson.
Paradoxically, that may be the main reason why you should read it."

How would you describe your mind? 
Analytical and chaotic, or neutral and silent? – In most cases, we deem the analytical side to be of utmost importance.
When it comes to tranquility, we need to ask ourselves the following question. 
Is it the stillness the speaks, or the action itself? 
Let’s see what Eckhart Tolle has to say about that.
Who Should Read “Stillness Speaks”? And Why?
We all know of 
 and his tone with regards to spiritual development.
In the past few years, he’s had a lot of open sessions on spirituality and how to attain the much-vaunted peace. 
In his YouTube videos, he gives his opinion on why stillness is best the weapon in the fight against aimlessness, depression, and despair. 
Hence, “
” is the ultimate guidebook for all people who want to find shelter and escape the madness of the material world. 
About Eckhart Tolle
According to many, Eckhart is the voice of reason.
Even celebrities such as Oprah, Jim Carrey have expressed their admiration for his words of wisdom, and how he changed their life, positively. 
Among other things, he is also the author of “
” (an international bestseller) and “
.”
“Stillness Speaks PDF Summary”
A real spiritual teacher does not feel the need to teach you how to survive nor which practices to follow. It doesn’t give you any new information, on the contrary, it tries to free your mind from the conventional wisdom that keeps you hostage in the world of attachment. 
In other words, a spiritual teacher attempts to “tear down” your belief system and leave you in total emptiness. 
Words conveyed up to this point act as a handbook that guides your efforts and incentivizes you to go deeper. With the help of a spiritually-awakened person, you must subdue the surge of thoughts, and tame the restless mind. 
This form of teaching originates from ancient times, sometimes even enriched with the sutras of ancient India. 
Just to be clear, sutras represent powerful pointers to the inner truth, with very little conceptual focus. 
Not just the ancient sutras, but the entire flow is merely an illustration of the stillness that speaks. 
The main thrust of Eckhart Tolle’s message is the fact that his word is in no way connected to any religion. It’s free from ties and meaningless indoctrination techniques. 
It speaks on behalf of humanity.
When silence is replaced with noisiness, you have abandoned yourself. 
This stillness is not something that can fade away, nor is it a “thing” one can attain. It’s the very core of your true self. 
If that’s the case, then how come I don’t see it?
The inner awareness is not something you can see; it’s the thing that sees. It’s the all-watchful eye of the soul, not a thing you should pursue to have in your possession.
On a busy day or a morning rush hour, you can feel the tension; it’s almost as if the negativity penetrates your heart. 
Well, the external noise is by no means more damaging than the internal chaos. 
Look at a tree, take a look at a plant, allow your mind to get back into its original state of silence. 
When silence becomes the driving factor in your life, peacefulness will emerge. We have been misled completely with the notion that happiness is a result of something attained after a long and arduous journey. 
From a spiritual standpoint, drawing happiness from the material world reflects an adrenaline surge. It doesn’t yield permanent benefits, only momentary satisfaction.
Real intelligence is hidden beneath the surface.
The tide of thoughts wields enormous influence over your life. And every single one that pops into your head is perceived with extreme care. 
Here’s a tip for you:
Your thoughts are not that important, let alone genuine! 
You’ve been a victim to a sequence of imposed opinions, beliefs and emotions. It’s time to snap out of it, and allow stillness to take over. 
Nobody denies the practicality of thinking, Eckhart Tolle only divulges information regarding the limitations of the mind and how you can overcome them. 
Keep in mind that the shallowest form of life is one of the thought. 
Throughout history, nothing has caused more suffering than the agendas and dogmas adopted by the members of a certain community. 
If you continue to identify with the thought, you’ll remain imprisoned. 
The stream of thoughts hampers the spiritual awakening and withers the inner evolvement. 
If you intend to grasp the truth while resting on the mind as the only channel, brace yourself for a big surprise.
The mind is confined in its essence, and all of its fruits are somewhat tainted. 
The egoic sense of self is powered by the need for identity, and the desire to obtain status. Eckhart Tolle portrays it like a wild animal in pursuit of meat, one that must constantly feed itself in order to survive. 
The main question is – when you say “I” what are you referring to? Your story, or perhaps your religion? 
By no stretch of the imagination is this sense of “I” constant and not-fluctuating. It’s prone to twists and modifications based on the environmental hurdles that it comes across. 
, this is a self-destructive reality, but to you is a form of liberation. 
Ask yourself – who is the observer or the seer of thoughts? Who is aware of the restless nature of the mind, who sees the psychological effects of a certain phenomenon that takes place in your mind? – No, you can’t see the seer; you can only be that. 
The deeper sense of “I” contradicts the need to control the past and the future. 
The preoccupation with what is to come is entirely within the real of the Ego. 
The victim culture or the victim mentality only adds to this dangerous ideology that basically manifests the kinetic energy of the ego. 
A great deal of sadness stems from this perpetual tendency to condition your existence.
And you do just that when you undermine the only thing that can’t and will not evaporate – the present moment. 
If you think that being in the Now requires mental strength, then you better change your tune. 
There’s not one thing that has happened in the future, and yet we feel hesitant to embrace the reality. 
You are not your thoughts; you are not your mind, you are not your emotions – you are the witness that keeps a watchful eye on these rising tendencies. 
Most of the things about life are evaluated through the eyes of the community. Your status or position in society is also under heavy scrutiny, and the life you live is under constant bombardment by the societal norms of success. 
It seems that, if you are not good-looking and rich, you don’t deserve to be happy.
Societal stature holds no meaning whatsoever because it relates to conceptual indoctrination, not the true self. If you only want to scratch the surface, then hunting down your imaginary enemies will suffice. However, if you have a genuine desire to delve deeper, then you have to relieve yourself from all the brands, labels and false titles attributed to your sense of self. 
Once you crush the inner resistance, you’ll be able to see who you actually are. 
So, who are you?
By being aware of your true nature, as the awareness in which the floating and non-consistent appear, you’ll become free of life-interpretations.
Long story short, what happens on the outside will no longer be a relevant factor in how you interact with your core-self. All the things that once caused despair will be caught in the midst of this transition, never to rise again. 
As a result, playfulness and cosmic dance will subtly take over your body & mind.
You’ll no longer be obsessed to re-create situations that are long gone, nor you’ll be inclined to agree with the overall projections of success. 
It might occur to you that society is not on your side, and you’ll also see how hard it is to stand with your shoulders straight. 
The habits that once were the embodiment of your life-choices will begin to die out. The self-identity portrayed as the egoic consciousness requires your attention to function, and if you don’t give your energy to it – it’s game over.
 believe that the best way to tackle this tendency is to do one thing at a time. 
Just forget about asking questions like:
By continuing this battle, you’re doing the opposite of surrender. 
Surrender to the flow of life, and forget about pulling the strings! 
The interrelatedness of all things is what Buddhism has known and has preached since its early beginnings. Physicists of the modern age, now have the means and resources to look into it and uphold these beliefs.
The more we put labels on our existence the more we deviate from the center. 
If we really like to put an end to all the suffering, we must look at freedom as much more than a concept. 
It reflects one’s liberation from the cultural, religious, social and personal features. 
It’s about embracing the moment and living the life in accordance with this law. Only then we can experience the end of suffering.  
Suffering truly is a broad term, and everyone interprets it differently. The analogy of it is quite disturbing because it signifies the ignorance of the humankind. 
Happiness and peace don’t need any strings attached to validate their existence, whilst unhappiness and suffering need to cling onto something, or better yet a personal story. This conceptual identity derives its legitimacy from our interpretation of a certain life-situation and fuels the existence of the egoic-self by perceiving it as the only reality.
The “suchness” of each moment (not in time, but in presence) is not flexible! 
Unlike the past and future, the presence has no memories, no plans, and no pain. 
It’s not the situation that makes you unhappy, but your thoughts about it.
It all boils down to this – unhappiness has no authority in the Now.
Key Lessons from “Stillness Speaks”
1.      Noisiness = bad outcome 
2.      Keep your wits
3.      Refrain yourself from plunging into mind-chatter
Noisiness = bad outcome
It really doesn’t come as a shock to anyone that whenever you are pissed off about something, you can’t think rationally.
Then why even bother mentioning this? 
Because, according to Eckhart, being emotional is not on an equal footing as winning the inner argument.
Keep that turbulence outside your head. 
Keep your wits
The world isn’t a land of milk and honey. Sometimes, a given situation may overwhelm you, and pound you while you are down.
Remember, people, grow roots when things get tough. 
Don’t fight it, and accept that you don’t have control over this predicament.
Refrain yourself from plunging into mind-chatter
No matter how many times we say it or hear it; you should really know where to look for answers. The painful past and the unknown future, should not be your first choice.
Eckhart reckons that the present moment destroys all the concepts in its wake and the only thing you should do is embrace it.

Our Critical Review
Are you ready to sit back and let it go? 
It’s something similar to being stranded on a deserted island, and the only thing left for you to do is to accept your present moment. 
By accepting, Eckhart Tolle doesn’t mean forcefully admitting defeat. 
It indicates our inner realization of the only thing that never changes (The Now) – your true self. "
Power Up PDF Summary,https://blog.12min.com/power-up-pdf-summary/,https://blog.12min.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image2-2.jpg,"9 min read ⌚ 
Do you want to be a successful woman?
Or do you feel like you already are – but you’re still trapped in a man’s world?
Magdalena Yeşil wants to share a few lessons with you.
They all boil down to the simplest of all imperatives:
Who Should Read “Power Up”? And Why?
We’ve already provided you with a fair share of summaries of books written by the women leaders of today for the women leaders of tomorrow.
You can find brief summaries – as well as links to longer ones – of some of the best among them 
.
Let’s just say that 
would have been on that list if we had the chance and the time to read it earlier.
So, all you businesswomen and female entrepreneurs out there – take note! Especially if, like Yeşil, you’re in the tech industry.
The world of tomorrow needs you; and you need to hear how the women shaping it got to do just that. It’ll be easier afterward.
About Magdalena Yeşil
 is a San Francisco-based Turkish-American entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and investor of Armenian heritage.
An immigrant already at the age of 18, Yeşil came to the United States in 1976 with less than $50 dollars and no more than two suitcases filled with the essentials. 
In barely few decades, Yeşil grew to become one of the most recognizable females in the tech industry, board member of some of the world’s top tech companies (SoFi, Smartsheet, Zuora), and one of the founders the first investor in Salesforce, the cloud-based software pioneer.
After having a stint as a general partner at U.S. Venture Partners, Yeşil founded some of the earliest e-commerce and Internet access start-ups in modern history: UUnet, CyberCash, and MarketPay; this earned her the coveted Entrepreneur of the Year title by the 
 magazine.
Yeşil is also the founder of Broadway Angels – a group of female angel investors and venture capitalists – and DriveInformed, her fourth startup.

“Power Up PDF Summary”
If you are living in the United States, then most of the things happening in the country during the past few decades may seem to you strange – especially in relation to employees’ rights.
After all – and this goes to all those people saying that the gender gap is a myth and so on and so forth – until very recently, you could barely find a single company in America offering maternity leave.
Translation:
If you were a woman and you got pregnant, then you had no choice but to leave your job – unless you wanted to abort.
In other words, you had to choose: either a mother or a successful businesswoman.
And, in some ways, things haven’t evolved past a certain point even today; but they sure have changed – and it is time women start rewriting the rules.
The Three Principles of Powering UP
Before becoming a multimillionaire and a respected board member of so many hi-tech companies, Magdalena Yeşil was an engineer just like many others.
And one time, during her first engineering job, she designed a semiconductor chip; it wasn’t the best thing in the world, but, in her opinion, it wasn’t the worst either.
However, her bosses certainly thought otherwise; after she presented to them the chip’s logic functions, she was severely criticized by almost each of them.
Now, she could have bottled up or replied back, but Magdalena choose the only sensible solution: she decided to be attentive and listen to every word coming in her direction.
Why?
Because these were people with much more experience than her and because she was merely a beginner.
This brings us to the second principle of powering UP: staying firm on your course even after making a mistake, no matter how terrible.
In fact, the unsuccessful first attempt at designing a semiconductor chip described above is not very high on the list of Yeşil’s things to regret.
Somewhere around the top is her decision to reject Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak’s job offer in the early days of Apple.
The reason?
She was advised by a fellow worker to never accept a job at a tech company named after a fruit.
The logic wasn’t sound, but it certainly influenced Yeşil’s rejection which, very soon, started hurting her like hell.
But did she give up?
No – she didn’t.
She just got out the best of the situation: a lesson for the future. 
In her case: always make informed decisions.
And once you gather enough info about a certain thing, then don’t look back; even if it doesn’t work out in the end, this won’t happen that often; 
, chances are, once you are informed about something, you’ll be right more than 50% of the time. And that is enough.
Take Marc Benioff, for example (by the way, the author of the foreword to 
).
The guy was a vice president at Oracle and, yet, he decided to give up on it all and found his own company, Salesforce.
He had no more than 10 employees at the beginning, but he acted confident in front of them as if he knows where the path would lead him.
He didn’t.
But his confidence paid off: he’s now worth more than $6 billion.
(And, by the way, it is 
; so great job, Marc!)
The Benefits of Intrapreneurship
Let’s just say that you are a teenager with an idea which, you believe, may change the world.
Do you:
a) gather some money and found a startup; or
b) find a job at a company in a similar niche?
You probably guess that the right answer – contrary to what most people would say – is the latter one. At least as far as Magdalena Yeşil is concerned.
Her reasons for this?
Well, first of all, you’re probably not ready for a start-up; not only in terms of knowhow but also in terms of the effort you’ll be required to put in for it to work. Think 24/7 – and this is not an exaggeration.
Steady paycheck and regular hours will help you build a much necessary pace before you dive in headward into the unknown.
In addition – as it should be only obvious – working for another company would result in enhancing your skillset for the future.
Finally, it’s a neat way to ensure future investors. After all, who do you think your boss at this company will be more willing to give his money: a dedicated worker or an unknown teenager?
Overcoming the Gender Pay Gap
Do you know why people resist change?
Because change opens the door to the unknown and the unexpected; and because, even when wrong, the status quo is at least predictable.
Well, this is the reason why women face so many problems in the workplace, sometimes receiving 
.
Yeşil’s advice:
Power UP!
Go and get what you deserve.
And be prepared to fight for it in advance.
She lists a few examples of women who were denied a promotion because of their inability to document their talents and competencies.
No – we’re not talking about CVs and portfolios!
We’re talking about documenting the results of every single of your own decisions, especially when you’re at a higher level in a company.
That way, when you go to your boss to demand a raise or a promotion, you will be the one prepared for him – and he will not be for you!
(Yes, we chose to write “he” for a reason.)
How to Get an A in Attitude and an F in Victim
As you have probably realized by now, 
advocates a no-nonsense approach to almost everything; and that includes sexual harassment as well.
Tired of all of those rude comments from the male colleagues in your office?
Time to develop some gravitas.
Suit up, 
, and make eye contact with the person who makes the comment. 
Now say one of these three things:
: “Now, what exactly do you mean?”
: “I know you think you’re funny, but I’m uncomfortable with your sense of humor; hopefully, you’ll be smart to accept that.”
: “The head of HR said to me that he doesn’t have a lot to do lately; perhaps you’d want to visit him?”
What? Do these things sound too inappropriate?
Strangely enough, most people seem to think that; assertive men are the leaders of the free world; assertive women are, well, bitches.
Yeşil’s advice: be a bitch until you give that word a new meaning. 
It’s better to be a bitch than a martyr – 10 out of 10 times.
Not just for you.
Mommy Guilt Is a Liar
Yes – 
.
We’ll repeat it because it’s true: maternity leave doesn’t spell the end of your career, and being successful businesswoman doesn’t mean giving up on building a family.
The truth is you can do all of those things simultaneously; the key: find a way to feel empowered in your career.
Magdalena’s mother Selma, for example, had to give up her promising career in medicine because she was expected to raise her children.
Of course, this eventually resulted in many regrets and, what’s worse, a bitter attitude toward everything.
However, when at 63, Selma got a job – the first one in her whole life – as a barista in a Whole Foods Market, suddenly her life transformed.
Why?
Because she started feeling that she doesn’t exist anymore 
someone or something; she was finally in a position to say: “I can make a contribution by being myself; and I can work 
 myself.”
And that’s the point: all those idealizations aside, motherhood is a sacrifice; but nobody is able to sacrifice his time or wishes for someone else until he/she figures out some things for himself/herself.
Otherwise, it’s too much of a burden.
Key Lessons from “Power Up”
1.      You Have Much More Power Than You Think
2.      The Three Characteristics of Powered-Up Women
3.      Be an Intrapreneur Before You Become an Entrepreneur
You Have Much More Power Than You Think
“Within each of us,” says Magdalena Yeşil, “lies 100 percent of the capability needed to overcome the obstacles to any goal we set for ourselves. You are much more powerful than you think.”
And you 
 – even though you sometimes feel as if a powerless victim to many passed-up promotions and comments by your male colleagues which border on sexual harassment.
If taking matters in your own hands requires you to become a bitch – then become one.
No matter what they say, even condescending 
.
The Three Characteristics of Powered-Up Women
According to Magdalena Yeşil, powered-up women share three traits:
1. They are their own primary energy source;
2. They refuse to accept the rules as they are written; and
3. They never define themselves by gender or any other exclusion parameter or allow anyone else to do the same.
Magdalena Yeşil’s word of advice:
Be an Intrapreneur Before You Become an Entrepreneur
This lesson goes to all the entrepreneurs out there, men or women.
Unless you are some kind of a genius, then it’s better to have some work experience before you decide to create your own start-up.
If you’re working in the niche, you can even be an intrapreneur – building your own company from within a company (aka partnership).
That’s what experienced intrapreneur Debra Rossi did while working as the executive vice president of Wells Fargo; namely, she recognized the potential of eBay and brought both herself and her company a lot of money.

Our Critical Review
Even if you don’t know Magdalena Yeşil’s name – as you have probably already read in her biography – you’re quite familiar with some of her work; and you’ll have to agree that the things she has done – despite being one of the first women in the tech world – are more than admirable.
Well, in

She drops the readers into the vividly recounted, career-defining moments to help them navigate and overcome gender bias in their own lives.”
Murat Sünmez, member of the World Economic Managing Board, agrees, claiming that 
“should be required reading for anyone building a company or making a career” and that Yeşil’s lessons “are more relevant than ever.”

Few months ago I heard 
 in an interview saying that 
. This shouldn’t be our goal. Mission come first and leads us to success.
I felt in love instantly by this idea. So, when I found out about this book, I looked foreword to know more about his approach. So, take a look on some interesting ideas I’ve discovered in this book.
“
“ is more than a guide to succeed. This book is a 
 that provides you with all the ingredients needed to define your goals and to take you to the winner position.
The information is much more valuable while it is the results of authors’ experiences over the past 10 years working closely with businesses of all sizes and in a large variety of industries around the world.
So, what 
 bring new by this book is the fresh, realistically and applicable lessons in order to build successful and powerful organizations, with teams strongly engaged in the mission.
Economy’s rules are changing so fast. It’s not enough to play the game. You have to rule the game. If you can’t keep up, you lose, become one with the background and are forgotten instantly.
Learning still represents the main prerogative of overcoming failures. Maybe theories are beautiful and make you believe in the perfect world, perfect idea, and perfect solution. But what stands between these theories and reality?
All the lessons that Jack and Suzy Welch have put in this book are built around 5 key-concepts:
So, let’s see how Jack and Suzy Welch describe mission.
From their points of view, mission is the leitmotif of any organization by defying its destination: 
.
To get to the best destination you have to get the best mission which is built on three levels: 
.
In order to get where you want, you definitely have to catch the right “train”. And what better transportation than behaviors do you know?
But, lucky you! ‘Cause you’ll never be alone in this journey as long as you know how to invite your employees to be a part of it. 
 Soon enough the sun will raise at the end of the tunnel and you’ll see the real beauty of a good mission: 
At the end of this journey you’ll be glad not only because you’ve personally meet the success, but most of all because you understood the process by aligning mission with the values.
“Leadership” no longer has to be approached as a solitary concept. Try to associate it with two more powerful words: truth and trust.
After this brief exercise try to define the whole new concept: “truth-and-trust leadership”. If you think is still difficult to understand it, read the authors approaches from this book, related to this subject. Building a genuine leader is about truth and trust. 
And to get the real leadership, what you have to do is:
Growth means a Mecca for each business dreamer. The way may seem to you being longer, but useful and straight when you do it right.
So, what brings growth to your business? Great leadership. Great teams. Great strategy. Great data crunching Great, refreshed compensation plans. All these lead to growth.
You’ll find out in this book a generous part dedicated to this concept. You’ll learn how to build a “wow” team by using classical approaches as a main part of a smart strategy. After reading it, you may rethink about how hiring, motivating, developing, and retaining your best players should be done.
It is no use to deny that money is the engine of every business. It might seem hypocritical to say something like this.


On the other hand, the real problem with growth isn’t the amount of dollars you make available for your business. This is more about how you strategically allocate them.
You’ll find in Real life MBA a great approach on this topic. I let you discover it on your own. Until then, I give you one more clue:
This book is about re – innovating yourself by facing the mirror of business reality. Embracing the real world as it is, with all its turbulence and sudden changes. Understanding what modern management means, going beyond theories and idealistic patterns and identifying pragmatic solutions.
And that’s because….

“Bad Blood PDF Summary”
No – this has nothing to do with Taylor Swift.
Although the main protagonist 
 a charismatic, blond female wunderkind and millionaire born in the penultimate decade of the 20
 century.
And, just like a Taylor Swift romance, she is just too good to be true – until, suddenly, she isn’t.
Her name: Elizabeth Holmes.
Her dream: to become the next 
.
Hence all the turtlenecks.
Elizabeth Holmes’ Great Idea
Just like almost everyone alive, Elizabeth Holmes was pretty afraid of needles.
She was barely 20 years old when she had a wonderful idea: to device a wearable patch which would do away with needles altogether!
Comprised of numerous microneedles, the patch was supposed to be cheap and promised to make wonders in terms of blood testing and early diagnoses.
The problem?
It couldn’t be built: microneedles didn’t take the proper amount of blood for the blood tests to work.
Even though many medical professionals told Holmes this before she even made a single step toward making this dream reality, she persisted.
In 2004, she teamed up with Shaunak Roy – one of her peers at Stanford University – and she founded Theranos.
In the meantime, their idea evolved to something like this:
So, in a nutshell, a revolutionary device, one that could democratize healthcare.
Holmes and Roy believed that this device – dubbed the Edison –could also perform tests for 240 different ailments – so, it was basically the next big thing.
Now, who wouldn’t want to hop on that train?
The Plot Thickens: the Edison Can’t Be Built
As you are already aware by now, neither this miracle credit-card-sized blood-testing machine was just that – a miracle.
But in the bad sense; meaning: it was much more part of Elizabeth Holmes’ fantasies than it was part of reality.
As it turned out, the blood sample the machine took was just too small to be used in more than a few tests, let alone 240!
Timothy Hamill, vice chairman of the Department of Laboratory Medicine at the University of California, knew this beforehand, claiming that 240 separate tests on a single drop of blood would never be possible due to the nature not of the tests, but of the substance it tests: blood.
However, nobody seemed to believe Hamill; on the other hand, everybody was more than happy to believe the endlessly charismatic wunderkind that was Elizabeth Holmes, by the way daughter of Christian Rasmus Holmes IV, 
.
Investors Are Coming, Employees Are Leaving
As far as Elizabeth Holmes was concerned, not being able to build the Edison wasn’t a problem: she was too busy enjoying her fame to be burdened by such minor setbacks.
Also, she was too busy attracting investors – and they seem to be arriving at a world record pace.
By 2014, helped by Oracle’s very own 
, and the ad agency famous for collaborating with Jobs and Apple (TBWA\Chiat\Day), Theranos had already made a couple of lucrative deals and reached a value of almost $9 billion!
By this time, Holmes was so confident of her product, that she started throwing away numbers and unsubstantiated claims by the minute.
Like, for example, that the test results Edison prints in less than half an hour and that they cover not just 240, but as much as 800 different tests!
Now, why did the investors buy this?
The correct answer to that question would be “oh, boy where should we start?” followed by numerous excerpts from 
The short answer looks like this:
• Because of FoMO, the Fear of Missing Out;
• Because Theranos covered up all of the Edison’s flaws systematically, testing the blood of angel investors and test-patients on third-party machines and presenting the results as original;
• Because Theranos dodged FDA inspections, by claiming that the Edison was simply an information tool and wasn’t subject to FDA regulations;
• Because it cherry-picked for demonstrations only tests which worked (the Edison did work well in relation to about 20 tests about 20% of the time);
• Because it made its employees sign confidentiality agreements which prevented them from talking even after resigning;
• Because Elizabeth Holmes’ boyfriend, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, started filling the empty chairs with Indian workers, dependent on their work visas to stay in the USA.
Need we say more?
The Epilogue
Since the Edison was touted as a success by so many people, one of Theranos’ lucrative deals was with none other than Walgreens.
The second-largest pharmacy store chain in the US started offering in-store blood tests at more than 40 locations and even had some plans to expand these “wellness centers” when all hell broke loose.
Theranos, Elizabeth Holmes and Sunny Balwani were all exposed to be liars and falsifiers, and the company went all but bankrupt in 2018.
In addition, it was forced to repay $4.65 million to residents of Arizona, where more than million people used the Edison to test themselves.
Nobody knows how many of them suffered because of the false results; it is widely speculated that many may have even died.
Key Lessons from “Bad Blood”
1.      A Great Idea Doesn’t Make for a Great Product
2.      The Investors’ Quandary: The Fear of Missing Out
3.      You Can’t Build a Bus While You’re Driving It
A Great Idea Doesn’t Make for a Great Product
The story of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos is, more than anything, a cautionary tale for all of those people dreaming to become the next Steve Jobs (who, by the way, wasn’t exactly a nice person either).
All her faults aside, it’s not like Elizabeth Holmes didn’t have a great idea, one which had all the writing upon it that it is capable of changing the world forever, democratizing medicine and saving countless of lives due to early diagnosis.
However, a great idea doesn’t make for a great product and, whatever all those movies and self-help books are saying, sometimes it’s much better to give up.
Especially when smart people are saying that your idea can’t be put into practice. Because, simply put, as great as they sound, some things are impossible.
And yet, Holmes, emulating the stubbornness of her idol Steve Jobs, persevered.
Carreyrou describes her tragic endeavor in a must-quote passage:
The Investors’ Quandary: The Fear of Missing Out
Imagine yourself in the place of an investor offered by someone the opportunity of investing money in a potentially revolutionary invention such as a cheap, carriable blood-testing machine.
Already more than familiar with those stories about people turning down the Beatles or the Queen and intelligent stockholders missing out on an opportunity to cash in on ideas such as the PC or Microsoft, it’d be only natural for you to think twice before opting out.
The executives of Safeway – among many others – faced this quandary. They didn’t like Sunny and liked even less the fact that they didn’t get enough info. And yet they were still hesitant to walk away from the partnership.
“What if the Theranos technology did turn out to be game-changing?” – Carrreyrou tries to guess their way of thinking. “It might spend the next decade regretting passing up on it. The fear of missing out was a powerful deterrent.”
The thing is: it always is.
You Can’t Build a Bus While You’re Driving It
The bottom line of 
is that Theranos is more than a single start-up. It is a symbol for many others doing exactly the same.
A source of Carreyrou – a former high-ranking lab employee – summed up the unhealthy manner (pun not intended) in which these startups work with a nice analogy: “The way Theranos is operating is like trying to build a bus while you’re driving the bus. Someone is going to get killed.”
And even though Theranos failed, the modus operandi of the Silicon Valley hasn’t changed one bit:

At their first meeting, Kiyosaki said to Trump – I’m a millionaire, and you’re a billionaire, and that’s quite different. 
Donald asked him – What’s the point of the argument when millions of people would trade places with you if they had the chance? 
Robert replied: Being a millionaire is not a prerequisite for success. 
Let’s say, you have inherited a house, and the price of the real-estate has skyrocketed, but your yearly income is below $50k. It doesn’t matter that your net-worth is well over a million when you can declare bankruptcy if you fall seriously ill and require medical treatment. 
Nice analogy, let’s delve into it!
Who Should Read “Why We Want You To Be Rich”? And Why?
If you believe that rich people are afraid of seeing other people getting wealthy, you better think again. 
This is not a video game, but the real world. 
A better economy means more opportunities for people to get out of poverty, so you becoming rich is in everyone’s best interest! 
What’s the problem then?
The victim-mentality is seeping into America, creation generations of underdogs who believe they have the right to the American Dream. 
The world is changing at a rapid pace, and all the things that were once relevant are fading into obscurity, therefore “
” is the book of the future. 
About Donald J. Trump & Robert T. Kiyosaki
When 
 wrote this book in 2006, nobody expected that he would become the 45
 US President. 
Apart from showcasing political prowess, no one can undermine his success in the real-estate business. Many Americans see his entrepreneurial mindset as a way of bringing America to the top, as the world top economic and military superpower. 
 on the other end, is a well-known business teacher, author, and the founder of Rich Global LLC.
In his books, he zooms in on the need for conducting a full-scale financial education to heal the American economy.
“Why We Want You To Be Rich PDF Summary”
Donald Trump & Robert Kiyosaki have one thing in common – the wits to make money. Both can be labeled as successful entrepreneurs who have a vision and make smart moves. They are also best-selling authors and persons who are fearful of America’s lack of financial education.
Before we take things onto the next level, it’s vital to mention that there are three levels of financial advice:
Here and there, you’ll find people talking about finances and how to increase your assets value, but no one gives any actionable advice. It stands to reason why you should consider altering your approach, but when it comes to money, nobody is willing to take any chances.
Transparency emerges as the new swipe at the face of misleading information!
Truthfully, people are not inclined to follow a certain agenda, without being absolutely sure that it will not backfire on them. And, because American society is not exactly financially literate, the US continues to increase its debt and lose market opportunities. 
The once well-known Dream is coming to a halt, and giving more money to the hands of the poor only aggravates the problem. 
Contrary to the socialist mindset, taxing the “Rich” and giving it to the poor is merely a death-wish for the American Economy.
Let’s see why:
Donald Trump & 
 voice concern about the enormous debt that continues to accumulate and it now exceeds the combined value of all the bonds and stocks, globally.
According to Trump, one of the obvious reasons is the nurturing of the victim mentality and the idea of entitlement!
The American economy will cripple if the needs of all people are addressed because the money accumulated through taxes cannot cover government spendings!
If you have money problems, believe us when we say you are not the only one. If you want to become rich and create opportunities, then you must practice the craft of dealing with financial liabilities as they incur.
Apart from not yielding to fear, you also need to make smart moves under pressure and perform when things get rough. Every generation has its challenges, and yours is not excluded from that reality.
In the 20
 century, we had stuff like 
, WW2, Communist Expansionism, etc. The antidote to this chaos was taking the safe route by going to school, finding a good job, and reaping all the benefits upon retirement.
This life-trajectory is no longer an option, and you need to find another path!
To do that, you need financial intelligence. Kiyosaki describes it as the ability to prosper and stay with both feet on the ground when things go south. For example, he addresses the never-ending soar of energy prices, and why when energy prices go up, the country follows on this decline.
Robert Kiyosaki also mentions about plowing back into the Oil-business, because he gets 70% write-off + 15% depletion allowance upon investing.
If you think that putting up money in something is merely a risk-taking endeavor, then you surely are far from reaching success. Investing is not about calculating risks; it revolves around the process of taking the right actions that can bring profits.
It needless to say that 10% of Americans own or possess 90% of the wealth, and the gap doesn’t seem to disappear. 
Kiyosaki argues that currently, he is not a professional Golf player because he cannot fall into that 10%, and the same goes for singing, NBA, you name it. 
In other words, you need to choose the battle you can win!
Donald Trump follows up on this and says that being stubborn is an inevitable path to success. 
Quitters don’t make it far, and never shall. 
Some don’t want you to succeed, and they would rather stamp you out, but that’s not an excuse for backing down.
You might think that 
 pretty much follow the same rules, lean on the same logic, and make the same moves, but that’s not the case. Passive investors nurture a mindset that compels them to think and act in accordance with the motives listed below:
The main difference between rich, poor, and middle class is leverage. Investing and saving can never be put on an equal footing because one of them requires an excessive time-frame to pay off, and you may have some clue about which one that is. 
Investors are mainly cagey about sharing their secret sauce, unlike Donald and Robert who see the threat in leaving people to “rot” in poverty.
When we discuss investments, the questions you need to ask are: 
But even when you have all the tricks in your pocket, if you don’t act in the face of fear, you cannot win. 
In this summary, we try to make a distinction between active and passive investors and help you see the big picture as well. Probably, the most genuine depiction of how they differ is the fact that passive ones fear lacking money, while active ones see it as a challenge.
In addition, passive ones tend to choose more risk-free investments, while active ones opt for real-estate investments and business enhancement. 
Previously we said something about leverage, and perhaps you cannot discern any meaning from it. However, leverage simply means, the ability to achieve or do more with less. 
It’s no wonder why we hear the slogan “
” all the time. Have you ever seen a mediocre person who has achieved something extraordinary? No, because the mindset of that individual, keeps him/her in a state of chaos. 
To sum it up, let’s list the five things you need to have in order to find yourself at the top of the heap:
The biggest dilemma of all that upsets the socialist class is – Why the rich keep getting richer? 
First and foremost, it’s much easier to invest when you have the resources to do so. However, many lottery winners have declared bankruptcy in a three-year time-frame after winning millions of dollars. That shows – giving money to people without financial education is not going to get them out of poverty. 
The truth of the matter is that you don’t need to bail out of school, nor to quit from your 40-hour job but shift your perception of life. 
There are a number of games or let’s say extracellular activities that can stimulate parts of your brain to make better decisions. This particularly applies to finances and managing money in general. 
Last but not least, it’s much easier to succeed if you have a good role model. 
Donald Trump singles out his father as the main figure that helped him to succeed, while Robert gives credit to the “Rich Dad” across the street who taught him so many things. 
Now the ball is on your side of the court.
Keep learning, keep expanding otherwise you’ll get the short end of the stick.
Key Lessons from “Why We Want You To Be Rich”
1.      Find out whether your father has the entrepreneurial mindset
2.      Be prepared to face the hurdles along the way
3.      Tackle the comfort
Find out whether your role model has the entrepreneurial mindset
An old adage says – there’s freedom in manual labor and we agree on that. There’s something profound about providing for your family and doing the hard work.
Nonetheless, the main issue is not the job itself, but the environmental demands. 
If you prefer to keep administrators and executors out of your life, then you must educate yourself, financially. 
Be prepared to face the hurdles along the way
You might think, well how to change my mindset if I don’t have any money, to begin with? How can I become a business owner or an investor if there’s nothing in my bank account? 
Transition commences not when you have the chance to throw money around or squander profits. 
As a matter of fact, it starts when the right attitude is in place, and hence the world will open up to you! 
Tackle the comfort
If you don’t feel like paddling to new unexplored shores, then no one can help you. Staying in one spot and waiting for a miracle to emerge is not something that is realistic. 
So, you have to move beyond the comfort zone and embrace the uncertainty, or dive deep into the unknown should you prefer.

Follow your gut, they say.
Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons beg to differ.
In 
 they claim that it’s sometimes much better to 
judge the book by its cover.
Who Should Read “The Invisible Gorilla”? And Why?
If you are interested in the inner workings of your mind and all the tricks it plays on you on a daily basis, then 
is just the book for you.
If it helps, it’s somewhat similar to books such as 
and 
; and it questions some of Malcolm Gladwell’s findings.
But more on that later.
About Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons

After receiving his B.A. in computer science at Harvard, he worked as an AI program manager in the University’s Psychology Department for the next five years. He received his Ph.D. in 1999.
A chess master since 1986, Chabris is currently Associate Professor of Psychology and co-director of the Neuroscience Program at Union College in Schenectady, New York, Senior Investigator at Geisinger Health System, and a Visiting Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse, France.
 is an American experimental psychologist, a Professor in the Department of Psychology and the Beckman Institute at the University of Illinois.
He has a B.A. in Psychology from Carleton College and a Ph.D. from Cornell University. 
Mostly, his work focuses on subjects such as inattentional and change blindness.
Somewhat unfairly, Simons and Chabris won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2004 for their “Invisible Gorilla” experiment, “one of the most famous psychological demos ever.”
“The Invisible Gorilla PDF Summary”
In 
, Malcolm Gladwell attempted to remind people of “the power of thinking without thinking” and to demonstrate, in no uncertain terms, that intuition is oftentimes better than extensive analysis, due to the fact that it is preprogrammed to tune out extraneous information and focus only on the relevant data.
If you remember, one of Gladwell’s famous examples included a purported ancient Greek statue known as 
; even though careful scientific analysis incorrectly judged it to be genuine, art experts were able to guess it was fake in the blink of an eye.
However, in the 
, Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons argue that Gladwell fails to see the big picture, and that, in reality, there are just as many situations which prove that the opposite is at least as accurate.
As an example, they cite the case of bibliophile Thomas James Wise, whose literary forgeries were exposed only after two young experts, John Carter and Graham Pollard, meticulously analyzed the forged books and published their results in a 400-page book titled 
.
The moral of the story?
And, as expected, that’s what 
 tries to prove.
It is a book about “six everyday illusions that profoundly influence our lives: the illusions of attention, memory, confidence, knowledge, cause, and potential.”
Let’s have a look at them all!
Key Lessons from “The Invisible Gorilla”
1.      The Illusion of Attention: “I Think I Would Have Seen That”
2.      The Illusion of Memory: “I Remember Perfectly”
3.      The Illusion of Confidence: “I’m Better Than the Score Shows”
4.      The Illusion of Knowledge: “I Know More Than I Do”
5.      The Illusion of Cause: “I’m Not Superstitious… Just a Little Stitious”
6.      The Illusion of Potential: “I Could Have Been Someone….”
The Illusion of Attention: “I Think I Would Have Seen That”
In 1995, Boston police officer Kenny Conley was chasing a shooting suspect when an African-American undercover officer was mistakenly taken down and beaten up by other policemen in his nearest vicinity.
Conley was tried and later convicted of obstruction of justice and perjury because the jury didn’t buy his story that he hadn’t noticed the beating up of his colleague.
And, let’s face it: Conley’ story was not exactly a believable one. Now, how could he miss the battering of a black policeman happening right next to the fence he was climbing to try to catch the criminal?
Well, hold your horses and spare a minute to watch the clip below before continuing below:
Did you see the gorilla?
Chances are – you didn’t because more than 1 in 2 guys doesn’t.
Why?
Because we’re not programmed to!
When we focus on one thing – like the counting of the number of times the players in white pass the ball between them above – our mind isn’t interested in anything other than that and ignores even giant slow-moving gorillas in the middle of the screen!
That’s probably what happened in the case of officer Conley: too focused on catching the criminal, he may have missed the beating up happening near him.
The illusion of attention is all about anticipations and expectations; since we’re not prophets (and there will always be a 
 lurking from around some corner), this is a very dangerous illusion.
Case in point: half of all motorcycle accidents involve collisions with cars, and two-thirds of them are the direct result of a car turning left and not noticing the motorcycle.
Why?
Because the driver is expecting – and is wary of – another car exclusively.
The Illusion of Memory: “I Remember Perfectly”
There are some people who have an excellent memory, but it’s nothing more than a simple brain rule that 
.
“Our memory has no guarantees at all,” writes Freud in 
 “and yet we bow more often than is objectively justified to the compulsion to believe what it says.”
Freud pinpoints the catch perfectly: our brain has evolved to simultaneously remodel our memories and make us believe in their accuracy.
That’s merely a fact of life and the reason why 63 percent of all people believe that memories are basically film recordings.
However, they are not!
An experiment suggested by the authors of 
shows how they work in actual fact. You can try it yourself.
First, spend a few seconds looking at this list of words: 
.
Now cover your screen and try to remember as many of the words as you can; spend as much time as you like.
If you are like 40 percent of the people, you’ve probably included the word 
in your list.
But, look again: that word is not in the list.
True, all of the words above are related to it, but your brain has fabricated the memory of it being present, because, by nature, it doesn’t it doesn’t 
 events, but 
 them.
There’s a big difference between the two!
And that difference boils down to this: even if you remember something vividly, there’s no way you could know if your memory is correct or not unless there’s some video/photographic evidence.
The Illusion of Confidence: “I’m Better Than the Score Shows”
Here’s an interesting statistic: more than two-thirds of Americans and Canadians think they are more intelligent than your average Joe.
The problem?
Your average Joe should be smarter than half of the population – neither more or less.
In other words, about 20 percent of the people living in North America are confident that they know more than they actually know.
But, you’ll justly object, how would we know if they are right or not? After all, intelligence is not an exact science!
And since Chabris and Simons are the first ones to agree with your claim, they have already conducted an experiment in a community where the numbers are much more precise and where they tell more than a simple story.
Namely, the chess community.
Strangely enough, Chabris and Simons uncovered much the same pervasion of this illusion of confidence: 75% of the chess players at the World Open in Philadelphia and the U.S. Amateur Team Championship in New Jersey thought that they were underrated.
And not by little: by an average of 99 points!
In chess, it’s pretty difficult to regularly beat an opponent rated 100 points above you; and yet, most of the people, despite numerous losses to precisely this kind of opponents, think that they can.
Ironically, if everyone who thinks should be rated higher is rated higher, the only thing that would change is the standard.
And there’s another twist to this story!
Namely, in 
Charles Darwin observed that “ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge.”
Justin Kruger and David Dunning proved this in an aptly titled 1999 study, “Unskilled and Unaware of It.”
The gist of it is a paradox: the less skilled you are, the less knowledge you have of your unskillfulness. Hence – the unwarranted confidence.
The Illusion of Knowledge: “I Know More Than I Do”
It doesn’t matter whether you’re an expert in your field or not; in many cases, your guesses for the future may be just as good as the most uneducated person alive.
Why?
Simply put, because we don’t know the future and, no matter how much things we know about the present, there’s always the chance (nay, the inevitability) of a black swan.
Consider the following examples:
• In 1957, Herbert Simon and Allen Newell, winners of the A.M. Turing Award in 1975 (Simon also won a Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978), predicted that a computer would be able to beat human chess players within a decade; they were very, very wrong;
• In 1968, David Levy, a computer programmer and an avid chess player, bet four other computer scientists the very opposite: that no computer will ever be able to beat a human chess player; in 1989, Levy lost to Deep Thought and in 1997, Kasparov lost to IBM’s Deep Blue;
• Even better – not included in Chabris and Simons’ book – Irving Fisher, USA’s greatest economist at the time, predicted that the “stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau” back in 1929; 
.
Socrates believed that he knew nothing – and it was 
 that he was dubbed the smartest man of his day and age by the gods.
It seems that there’s a lot of truth somewhere in there; many people know a lot less than they claim that they do; and this is what Nassim Nicholas Taleb constantly raves against.
It’s very, very, very dangerous to do that.
The Illusion of Cause: “I’m Not Superstitious… Just a Little Stitious”
Like it or hate it, “our minds are built to detect meaning in patterns, to infer causal relationships from coincidences, and to believe that earlier events cause later ones.”
On the face of it, there’s nothing wrong with either of them – they all help us lead more meaningful lives, sometimes even guiding our most important decisions.
For example, a doctor guesses your disease based on a pattern of symptoms, and a sports coach establishes his tactics after carefully deducing the patterns noticed in the behavior of the other team.
However, dig a little deeper, and you’ll see the problem: it is because of these patterns that we sometimes don’t see how random the world actually is.
In other words, there’s no man on the moon – these are just some randomly scattered moon lakes; also, you can’t really hear “Satan” when you play “Stairway to Heaven” backward unless you ready yourself to hear precisely that.
And therein lies the rub: if we can only see the patterns we’ve previously acquired, then we’re pretty susceptible to brainwashing, not to mention inherently limited to a worldview created by our prejudices and superstitions.
Of course, the place you’re sitting at bears no relation to the score of the game; your brain just tricks you into seeing a pattern and creating a relation between two simultaneous events.
The truth is: you’ll have to try pretty hard to beat it.
The Illusion of Potential: “I Could Have Been Someone….”
“I could have been someone,” sings the male voice in The Pogues’ brilliant 
.
“Well, so could anyone,” answers the female singer.
This discussion sums up the last illusion analyzed by 
, the illusion of potential.
The illusion of potential, write Chabris and Simons, “leads us to think that vast reservoirs of untapped mental ability exist in our brains, just waiting to be accessed—if only we knew how.”
And it combines two beliefs.
First and foremost, that “beneath the surface, the human mind and brain harbor the potential to perform at much higher levels, in a wide range of situations and contexts, than they typically do;” and secondly, that “this potential can be released with simple techniques that are easily and rapidly implemented.”
You know what we’re talking about: no matter how many scientific studies claim otherwise – and regardless of the fact that it is utterly illogical – you still think that you use only 10% of your brain.
And, thanks to many bad to average movies and false studies, that there are some things which can easily and promptly awaken the rest of your brain.
For example, do you know that if you listen to Mozart, you become instantly smart?
OK.
But do you also know that this – and other claims such as these – have been transformed into multimillion-dollar businesses even though there’s almost no scientific support for them?

 “The Book of Mistakes PDF Summary”
As
we stated above, 
is a business fable.
But boy – is it a complicated one!
You see, unlike other business fables, this one interweaves three narrative arcs: one involving a monk on a mission in England of 1425, the second one involving a girl named Aria living in the American colonies in the 1770s, and the central one involving a depressed young man named David struggling in the present.
Before you think to yourself “Hey, I didn’t come here to find out the plot of a postmodern novel” – bear with us: 
makes a lot of sense, and, even though there are three storylines, you can easily follow each of them.
England, 1425: The Prologue
The first one is the shortest one: it is actually the prologue of the story.
It follows a monk with a mission and 
: “this mission he was on originated directly from the Prior, and it was as mysterious as the man himself. He didn’t question. His job was to follow orders, dutifully fulfilling his vows.”
And the exact nature of the mission?
First of all, carefully scribing ten copies of “an ancient book of wisdom from the desert lands of the far south, the lands of man-made stone mountains that reached to the sky.”
And then, distributing each of the manuscripts (one by one) to the Prior.
The reason?
After the successful completion of these two missions, the monk burns the original manuscript.
The ten copies are then distributed: one stays with the Keeper of the Book, and the other nine reach the Nine Teachers who oversee the dissemination of the Book’s knowledge.
“When will the entire world be ready for its wisdom?” – the monk wonders. “Will there be a day when the darker forces are so diminished that it will be freely available to all?”
The American Colonies, the 1770s: Aria
The next two storylines are interweaved: after a few chapters covering the events in David’s life (see below), follows one which covers the story of Aria, a young girl living in the American Colonies in the 1770s. 
Advised by her uncle Raymond, she undertakes a journey of discovery and peril during which we learn more about the origins of the book scribed by the monk in the first storyline, as well as about its content and distribution.
It is in this narrative arc that we learn more about the roles of the Keeper and the Nine Teachers which are continuously chosen by him to spread the message of the book.
As Aria struggles to keep the mysterious Book safe from falling into the wrong hands, she also discovers the Three Laws of Success.
We’ll get to them in a bit.
USA, Present Day: David
A young man in his twenties, David is not exactly a happy person. 
He feels overwhelmed with doubts and worries and has no idea which direction in life he should be taking.
One day, he gets “an unexpected, terse message” from his boss: “I need to see you in my office at 11:00.”
Fearing that he would be fired and crippled by anxiety, before heading to his boss’s office, he spends some time scanning the local news to clear his mind. 
There, he reads a story of a prominent businessman lauded for his charitable work.
Lost in thought, he almost trips over a young, attractive woman struggling to grab some yellow papers blown out of her hands by the wind.
After the meeting with his boss – during which he receives a verbal warning – David heads home, thinking about how important it would be 
At home, he discovers a piece of paper in his pocket, reading: “NORTH CAFÉ 10:00 a.m. Friday, September 14.”
And on the other side of it:
The letter is signed by the businessman mentioned in the newspapers, one of the most successful of his generation, a genuine “rags-to-riches” story.
So, even though he knows that this must have belonged to the girl he almost tripped over, David decides to go on the meeting, believing that any connection made with such a successful businessman may bring him future glory.
And it does – but not in the way he expects.

Key Lessons from “The Book of Mistakes”
1.      The 9 Mistakes You Should Never Make
2.      The 3 Laws You Should Never Break
3.      The 9 Secrets to Creating a Successful Future
The 9 Mistakes You Should Never Make
David arrives at the North Café and there he meets the businessman from the newspaper.
Dubbed the Old Man, he is not at all what David expects: casually dressed in faded jeans, a nondescript shirt and worn loafers, the Old Man has an unshaven face and a small leather book.
And he reveals to David that he couldn’t have discovered the invitation by mistake – because he is “in a perfect state of mind” to learn the lessons from the book.
OK, says David, I’m ready to listen. Give me the lessons.
“Do you think I can just hand them over to you?” says the Old Man. “I suppose I could… But the power wouldn’t be there. I’m not sure it would even work.”
“You have no idea the journey you are about to take,” he goes on. “Now that it has started, almost nothing can stop it. In fact, the teachers will appear at just the right time and in the most unlikely and unusual places. I wish I could be there myself. You’ll have a rendezvous soon!”
And true to the Old Man’s words, in the following weeks, Nine Teachers appear to David, each of them teaching him one of the 9 mistakes that can doom a person on his road to success.
The first teacher is the Playwright.
She was an actress once, but she decided to become a playwright when she learned the first mistake everyone makes: that there’s no point in working on someone else’s dream. 
“When you act,” she says, “you are fitting into the story. When you write, you are creating your own story.”
The message from the Book:
The second teacher is the Banker, who teaches David that a penny is worth more than a penny, aka that it costs more to make a penny than a penny is worth.
The underlying lesson: never judge a book by its cover.
Don’t accept the limitations others put on you. 
Just allow yourself to 
yourself – this will unleash fantastic power.
The third teacher is the Trainer at David’s gym.
Even though rather sickly throughout his life (and sad because of his inability to become a sportsman), he was transformed when he met a girl who overcame cancer to win a triathlon. 
The lesson: excuses prevent our progress. Avoid people who encourage them.
The fourth teacher is the Bartender.
He teaches David that “the people around us affect everything. Our friends determine our fate.”
In other words, that “who you are around determines where you go.”
So, he concludes, “replace naysayers, doubters and energy drainers with encouragers, winners and motivators.”
That is the only road to success.
The fifth teacher is the Bookseller.
She tells David that one of the worst things about life is being imprisoned in your comfort zone.
“Winners seek out the uncomfortable,” she says. “Leaders consistently push beyond what’s comfortable to stretch to new levels of achievement.”
In fact, she adds rather ominously, “mediocrity is the end result of too much comfort.”
The sixth teacher is the Entrepreneur.
He teaches David that his thoughts don’t control his destiny and that he shouldn’t allow his current circumstances to define his destiny.
He reiterates the notion that “excuses are the weeds that try to choke progress” and adds that “successful people see temporary failures as stepping-stones to success.”
The seventh teacher is the Conductor who teaches David how his best students stand out.
“Standing out,” he says, “is as simple as consistently outperforming expectations.”
The tragedy is that “most of us spend our lives learning to blend in when success is about standing out.”
Standing out is the same as being true to yourself and authentic.
It is the same as being in touch with your unique giftedness.
The eighth teacher is the Artist.
After David tells her that he doesn’t have a painting bone in his body, she reveals to him that “the world has unlimited opportunity.”
In other words – the problem is not with his painting capabilities, but with his mind, which constricts his potential.
There is no limit to it. 
“The only limitations you need to worry about are the ones in your mind,” she concludes.
The final teacher is the Doctor and a few of his patients.
They teach David the one last final mistake all of us make: believing that we have all the time in the world.
Knowing your life is limited is the only thing that will keep you focused on the most important part of your purpose.
Successful people – learns David – have a sense of urgency.
The 3 Laws You Should Never Break
While David is talking to the Doctor, a visitor knocks at his door.
“Oh, you already have a visitor,” she says. “Should I come back later?”
David looks at her face and realizes that the girl is none other than the one he almost tripped over before the beginning of his journey.
Her name: Aria, a name that has lingered in her family for a few hundred years.
And that links the storyline of David in the present to the one of Aria’s identically named ancestor Aria in the 1770s, when she reveals the three laws of success.
You should remember each of them, so let’s quote them in full.
Each of the words below is taken from the author, Skip Prichard.
If you’ve followed the storylines closely, you’ll already guess why. 
Because the ancient Book is actually 
.
“The Law of Desire is the first law. Desire is a spring overflowing to fill your life with goodness. All opportunity, all achievement, all power is activated first with a burning desire.
Desire the noble; think high thoughts; feast on the abundance of possibility. Guard against wasting your desire on the insignificant and small.
Only when your desire is great enough does it activate the winds of achievement to propel you to the impossible. Do not proceed without picturing your desires achieved fully. Your desire sets the course of your destiny.
Desire prevents others from limiting or labeling you unfairly. Desire pushes your thoughts to a new level, one higher than you think is possible. Let your desire burn within to fuel your success.”
“The Law of Gratitude is the second law. Gratitude is the fertilizer for the bounty of success, the enabler of the harvest. A grateful spirit magnetizes people, ideas, and opportunity.
With a grateful heart, one is able to receive blessings that pass over those who are bitter. Uplifted hands of gratitude have no expectation and yet are filled joyfully with abundance.
Inside a thankful person is love and an overflow of joy. One may unlock the mystery inside with a continually thankful attitude. Those who drink richly from the cup of thankfulness find themselves refreshed and their cup refilled. Count your daily blessings until your years are rich.
On its wings, gratitude lifts those in despair onto winds of plenty to fly above life’s pains into the everlasting place of abundance. Speak gratitude to others and you fuel the mysterious power of the spirit.”
“The Law of Belief is the third and final law. The Almighty created you with purpose. Believe in yourself. What seems impossible and implausible is only the enemy of your potential.
Develop an unshakeable, unwavering, unbendable faith in your ability. Your destiny will expand as your belief expands. There are really no limits to what is possible for you.
Allow your beliefs to soar like an eagle. You cannot rise higher than your own beliefs. Most importantly, when you are able, help instill belief in others. This is the most important task of all—for once belief multiplies, nothing shall be impossible.”
The 9 Secrets to Creating a Successful Future
Unsurprisingly, the 9 secrets of success are the opposite of the 9 mistakes of failure.
In order, they are the following ones:
1. Live your own dream.
2. Recognize your inherent value.
3. Reject excuses.
4. Surround yourself with the right people.
5. Explore outside your comfort zone.
6. Move forward through challenges with determination and purpose.
7. Stand out.
8. Act boldly with the knowledge that your potential for success is unlimited.
9. Pursue your goals with urgency

Get a degree, and you’ll at least become an upper-middle-class citizen, is that correct? 
Certainly not in this world. 
Obtaining a college degree is anything but a recipe for success. 
With competition skyrocketing in recent years, and jobs migrating to other countries, Americans have to understand finances before embarking on an arduous journey. 
Let’s see how that pans out!
Who Should Read “Why “A” Students Work For “C” Students”? And Why?
Whether you are a plumber or a stockbroker, this book will positively speak to you. 
It teaches the young generation how to overcome the struggle to find decent work in an overly ambitious and combative workforce. It also helps you understand finances, and why “A” students fall behind the “C” students. 
With that said, we believe that “
” is recommended for the wider audience.
About Robert T. Kiyosaki
 is an American businessman and an author who has shed light on why having the best grades is not sufficient for success. 
He is the author of:
“Why “A” Students Work For “C” Students PDF Summary”
School and education overall, sometimes fail to recognize the potential in some kids, case in point, Albert Einstein and Thomas Edison. 
They were both labeled as insubordinate, headstrong, clumsy, and mixed up. 
Nonetheless, they came out of the woodwork years later and revolutionized the world with their great inventions.
So the question is:
How come the “C” students overshadow the “A” students in real life? – They learn what “A” students regard as irrelevant.
In the 2012 Presidential Election, Obama vs. Mitt Romney, you can clearly see why finances taught at home matter so much. Obama revealed that he paid 20% on his $3million income, while Romney paid 14% on his $21 million. 
Many were infuriated, but it clearly can be attributed to the dexterity in finance, and lessons taught at home. 
The lesson is – give your kids a head start by teaching them how to manage their finance to prevent them from squandering the hard-earned dollar.
Upon the mortgage market collapse in 2007, many young adults with college degrees had literally zero chance to find the high-paying six-figure job of their dreams. Driven by fear, parents began to caution their children of what would happen, if they didn’t attend classes and enroll in a University.
Meanwhile, education became even more expensive, and thousands of students were swimming in debt upon graduation.
For the first time in history, American people questioned the education system and firmly believe that the next generation won’t do better.  
Why do we keep pressuring our kids to get a degree, when jobs are moving to low-wage countries? Why would anyone hire an American accountant, when you can simply outsource the work and get a much lower price? – It’s pretty simple to understand why the American dream is shattered. 
Also, why financial education is not taught at school? 
Robert asserts that education is key, but he harbors suspicions about the learning curve which seems to decline with each generation. 
The “
” slogan is starting to make less sense than ever. When Robert was just a boy, he would occasionally skip the chores to play Monopoly for hours after school. His dad would then come along, and tell him to stop wasting his time. 
Robert Kiyosaki’s dad was a socialist (or at least leaning toward socialism); the average paycheck guy should you prefer.
Between the age of 9-18, he would go to the Rich Dad house and learn the process of running a business firsthand. He understood the true meaning of capitalism, and how we all benefit from other people’s skills and talents. 
The endless stream of knowledge he received from being involved in the real deal from an early age, gave him the edge in real life. 
The Poor Dad (his father) wanted the safe path instigated through college, salary, security, pension, medical benefits, etc. 
Now you understand why so many people are graduating from college. The standards are lowered to the degree that almost any young kid who has no clue about his future can just sign the papers without understanding the financial burden of such actions. 
You cannot help but notice that parents, and people in general, try to protect their children from the harsh reality of today. As the world progresses, new expenses and liabilities will incur, leading to even greater uncertainty. 
Hence, many kids straight out of college cannot seem to fit in this workforce. 
This leads to a backlash and the rise of a phenomenon known as “
.” These are the kids who cannot survive on their own and are reliant upon their aging parents to take care of them. 
 – Employees represent the majority of the workforce, and are mainly those who strive for higher paychecks.
 – A large chunk of the people here are the “A” students such as doctors, lawyers, etc.
 – The innovators, the business creators such as 
, Bill Gates, etc.
 – Active investors such as 
.
Your mom and dad want you to fall into “E” or “S” quadrants, because it’s much safer, while the Rich Dad prepares you to take over the “I” Or “B” quadrant. 
Socialists live in “E & S” quadrants, while capitalists live in “I & B.” Whenever people shout “
” they don’t understand that the taxes are raised on high-earners, which means people from “E & S” quadrants. 
Investors and smart entrepreneurs prefer to remain capitalists who create jobs and value effort. It’s not too sketchy for them to find legal ways to pay less taxes. It’s simply a matter of finances not a matter of policies.
If you are keen to prepare your child for the battle lying up ahead, you have to make sure that you’re teaching them how to spend wisely and avoid unnecessary costs. 
In all honesty, it’s never too late to change quadrants and start thinking critically. 
Rich dad would say: 
, while Poor Dad dreads the idea of having money problems. You have to understand that long gone are the days when a person would get a job and spend 40-45 years in a single company only to retire and accrue various benefits. 
The main bridge between wealthiness and poorness is how we handle the money problems.
In addition, let’s take a look at the windows of learning that Robert holds in high regard!
During this period, you’ll see whether the system comprised of both parents and schooling has taught you well. 
Rich Dad places emphasis on assets, while Poor Dad on liabilities. 
You have to know where you draw the line by singling out the things which put money into your pocket and eliminating the ones that squeeze every bit of money that you earn.
 “Bs” & “Is” focus on asset acquisition, unlike “Es” and “Ss” who are not prone to think critically. 
According to Albert Einstein Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. 
Traditional education prioritizes content, not context. Context (person) holds the true meaning, and without it, content would not exist. 
It’s about the traits and habits these people endorse, espouse and promote:
A Poor Person might say:
Middle-Class Person might say:
Rich Person or “Rich in the making” might say:
Why the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer? – The solution is in the three income solution:
Just utilizing the “ordinary” method will get you nowhere. As an example, take a look at successful athletes and lottery winners, who failed to transform their income and ended up broke. Giving money to a poor person is not a guarantee for success, it’s quite the opposite because they don’t know how to manage finances.
Why put “A” students in this category and, why do “A” students fail? 
Well, mostly due to the fact that the school system only recognizes one intelligence. 
In addition, let’s list a few to get an aerial view of the problem:
Last but not least, don’t make snap judgments and believe that geniuses are greedy. That’s probably the most misleading information about capitalists, who upon receiving strong financial education are more than willing to share their fortune in numerous ways.
Remember, the American Dream is not something you have the right to demand, but something you have the right to pursue. 
Key Lessons from “Why “A” Students Work For “C” Students”
1.      It’s never too late
2.      Keep pushing, keep learning practically
3.      Fill the shoes of a great leader
It’s never too late
You might be a person in your late 30s or 40s, but that doesn’t stand to reason as to why you wouldn’t be a good candidate to shift your mindset. 
Many entrepreneurs unanimously argue that entrepreneurship embodied into capitalism is a mindset, not a profession. 
So, don’t feel discouraged to seize the world!
Keep pushing, keep learning practically
Yes, reading is essential but not as important as participating in debates, doing actual things and experimenting. 
Don’t be deceived by the notion that once you arrive at the office, you’ll have all the skills because you’ve been to the best schools.
It’s just nonsense! The real drama begins once you become part of the dynamic of 21
-century capitalism.
Fill the shoes of a great leader
Even if your prowess at something is not at a level that is required, the very determination to take the plunge is all that it takes to make a difference. 
In doing so, you’ll finally shrug off all the meaningless and trivial concepts that have poisoned you. 
Unleash your potential by throwing yourself into the fire, and accepting the leadership burden.

Who Should Read “The Facebook Effect”? And Why?
About 
“The Facebook Effect PDF Summary”
Facebook started with a simple need, an insight that Zuckerberg figured out quickly and built on it. The Harvard students wanted to have an online directory so that they can find out relevant information about each other. Zuckerberg just realized that an online directory with information uploaded by the users would solve this need. And he built The Facebook.
But before that, and even after, Zuckerberg had been working on several other social networks, such as Facemash or Wirehog.
He felt social networks were the future, but he didn’t know how far this could go. It was not only the favorable context of the Internet evolution and his age, but also his gut feeling and hard work.
What most mattered to the success of Facebook was Zuckerberg’s vision along the way. He was never interested in making money, instead, he kept thinking about the most efficient way for people to stay in touch and share relevant information.
This was translated into a very important principle for Facebook – a genuine identity. This fact ensured that each person would upload real information on the profile page.
Having a real identity made it easy for friends to find you and you had no interest to upload fake information about yourself. This is what actually made Facebook so popular, the users’ confidence in the distribution of their data.
Zuckerberg’s vision of making people interact with each other and not with the website made Facebook simple and easy to use.
It simply expanded to other colleges and then high schools and eventually to anybody. It soon became international and within 5 years it became the most important social network.
At some point, Zuckerberg knew that if Facebook became mainstream, it would change the world the same way the telephone or the telegraph had done.
Another key factor in the Facebook’s success is represented by the people around Mark Zuckerberg.
He started everything with his dorm roommates who became his closest consultants and friends, but later on he hired people with experience in similar start-ups or big companies such as Microsoft, Yahoo or Google.
Even if he had quit college in order to grow Facebook, he always looked for valuable persons to join him. The people who worked with helped him to make the right decisions in key moments of the company’s history. At the same time, he always looked for young, smart people. He believed that they were more open and transparent – two core values of the company.
Even though Facebook was getting more and more successful, Mark Zuckerberg kept thinking ahead and added new features. So, now you can also find on Facebook features like: News Feed, Facebook Ads or Sponsored Stories.
As he never wanted intrusive advertising that would interfere with the user’s experience, he kept working to redefine ads until he met his objective.
The entire advertising world was redefined as Facebook became stronger. The consumers were the ones who are creating the content instead of the marketers. And a product or service recommended by a friend was much more valuable than any ad.
Facebook did make history as Zuckerberg wanted because it was designed from the first place for the people and not for the money.

Who Should Read “Getting Things Done”? And Why?
Apparently, writing “
” has created an option for closing down that organizational “pitfall”. The problem refers to the inability to properly conduct the process of sharing the amount of work in the company. Transport everything that is from your head into a reliable system which the users can review on a regular basis.
Corporations hate being forced to operate on the verge of uncertainty, meaning that the tasks delivered by their employees are not necessary – at least not in the present moment. Associates allow themselves to manipulate the system by finishing their work without communication.
Such mistakes can cause serious production issues and other managerial constraints. Once the activities are into the system, there is nothing to worry about, but aversiveness to change can sometimes play a considerable role.
Use the designated folders, baskets and boxes to lock-up all of your items. At the same time, horizontal controls will grant you the possibility to put anything of value into an organized framework, and the vertical controls can enable you to plan any projects.
Projects tend to get a little needy, once the implementation process is underway, to make it easy for you and the other associates, define the project’s scope, vision and adopt a set of principles.

About David Allen
was born soon after the end of WW2 on December 28, 1945. He as an American-born consultant, writer, editor, and historian left a mark in every industry related to his expertise. With more than two decades of coaching experience, he indeed is an “all-arounder”.
David spent his childhood in Shreveport, Louisiana and graduated from the University of Berkeley – studying American history. Later on, he founded “David Allen Company” and time management “Getting Things Done”.
“Getting Things Done Summary”
I recently finished reading this book and I already started implementing a lot of the things I learned from it. It initially appeared in 2002 and it was revised in 2015 with some new ideas and perspectives, mostly from a technological point of view.
David Allen is a productivity consultant for companies and individuals who feel that somewhere along the road, they got lost in the little things and are trapped in a vicious circle of 
 that consume their energy.
They know they have big projects, but they are not quite sure how to get started because it seems that there is always something in the way. Although many theories would suggest starting from the top down, and seeing the big picture when it comes to a project,
Allen 
 completely. In this new method, GTD (Getting Things Done) he says it is crucial to see “What the next action is?”, write down all your ideas about that particular project and divide it into small actionable steps.
This is actually one of the main ideas of the book and the entire system:
So in order to have a clear vision about our ideas, projects, plans and even day to day activities it is best to put them on paper. Sounds simple, but so many of us don’t use this system and we rely solely on our minds to remember stuff.
And that is not a big issue. The main problem is that we remember stuff in the moments 
 and we decrease our productivity:
Is there anything more important than a sharp vision? The phrase “put everything on paper” has some meaning, and this book summary is going to try and bring that message closer to the readers.
Whether we are talking about office, home, family, 
 or even vacations, it does not matter.
All things deserve to be treated with respect, because at the end of the day – productivity defines the quality of life. All of these topics should be written down in specific places where you know you will revise them again and make progress.
Getting Things Done resolves another issue: if you have an agenda where you write down everything in bulk, you will never really get to the bottom of things, and you will be overwhelmed by the amount of information that you gathered.
So one of the easiest ways to get organized is to use lists. Post-its, agendas, pens, paper, all the classic stuff that you usually keep around the house or in our office can help you in this process.
Of course, you can also use digital tools and rely on them to some extent, but it was proven that these traditional tools 
. How can you get started?
Allen suggests that it takes about a full weekend for some of his clients to go thoroughly through the entire process and organize their lives. You would need two days in which you are not distracted, you do not have important calls, tasks, and commitments.
You will need to go through all your stuff and make a complete inventory of your materials. If they are useful for some projects, if they are just reading materials, stuff you will deal with at a later date or simply just trash.
He recommends this process not only for individuals but also for companies: 
In order to be more productive, the author suggests using the two-minute rule.
So if something new 
 like an email or a memo that you have to answer with yes or no, if it can be done in under two minutes, the advice is to do it, even if you feel that it breaks your work cycle.
Leaving it for another time will mean that your emails are starting to gather in your inbox and perhaps answering after a week is no longer relevant to that topic.
Anything that requires under 2-minute actions 
.
In order to be more focused and present in our daily activities, Allen says we need to have a “Mind like water”:
How can you achieve a “mind like water” attitude? Well, first you have to take everything from your mind and write it down on a piece of paper.
You will instantly feel more relaxed because you now have a system which will help you remember things instead of constantly wandering 
 there when you should be focusing on one project at a time.
Once you do this and you have control over what is in your head, you need to find the right perspective.
Habemus GTD
David Allen, in developing his famous method, called this “open circuit” effect, which he defines as “anything attracting our attention that is not in its proper place as it is.” Complex things like “putting an end to hunger in Africa” or as small as “putting an envelope in the mail”.
The point of the book is that even people 
 will always be more relaxed, focused and productive if they learn to deal with their open circuits efficiently.
To do this, he proposed a method, which he called GTD, or Getting Things Done (Free Translation, “Leaving Things Done” or “Completing Tasks”). GTD is a system for controlling these open circuits so that you can focus on your current task at all times without distractions.
According to David Allen, every open circuit in your life must have its own place, organized and filed, so you can temporarily take it out of your head, with the peace of mind that when you need to revisit it, it will be properly cataloged.
Also, GTD also features a task prioritization system to ensure that you are always working on the most important activity at the time. The system is broken in steps. Get to know them below:
The first step to adopting GTD is to bring together the tasks that are taking away your focus. You can use paper, a tool like Evernote or even an email client to do this (our favorite is Google’s Inbox).
The tasks that you need to collect on this list will come from your day-to-day activities, but also from requests from co-workers, friends, and family. To succeed in this step, it is important that:
Every planned task should go to your collection system and thus get out of your head; This list needs to be constantly and cleanly revisited when you perform or cancel a task. Having this list is essential, and if a task is open in your head, it is important that you take note.
Otherwise, it will end up becoming a distraction that takes your focus every moment.
It is impossible to finish all your tasks and close all your circuits. It is human nature that new open circuits always appear. But if you cannot do all the tasks you wrote down, how can you keep your list empty? For this, there is a simple but extremely efficient cleaning process that keeps you organized.
 Identify the item: Before starting a new task, we must identify what is contained in it and make a careful analysis.
Ask yourself “What is this?” And understand in depth what that task represents.
This is very important especially when tasks are demands that come from other people such as emails. 
 what tasks need to be done to close the open circuit.
 Ask yourself, “Do I need to do something about it?”
This question is interesting because not all tasks really need to be performed, after all, some demands may have no meaning, or it may be that you or someone on your team is not necessarily the best person to do it.
If you identify a task that you do not need to take action, do one of the following: Put it in the trash. Archive it as “one day / maybe” (this is for anything you may want to do in the future but cannot do or do not want to do now).
Archive it as a “reference” (you do not need to do anything about it, but you may need this information later; it’s a good idea to have an organized system for storing reference items, either in your bookmark system, in an email folder Or even on paper on your desk).
[PRO TIP: Use Evernote] If the task requires your attention, but not immediate, it is best to mark it as such. It is essential to put it on a list to be revisited in the future. A good idea would be to put an automatic reminder on your calendar for when action needs to be taken.
[Pro Tip: Use Google Calendar or Google Inbox!] In the cases above, you have solved the item and can remove it from your collection system and thus close (although temporarily, in the case of future attention) the open circuit.
Most items in your collection buckets probably will not go beyond this stage. This step is essential to ensure that we have our heads free to start producing and focusing on the tasks that require our immediate attention.
If your list only has tasks that require immediate attention, now is the time to go to the next step
 Ask yourself, “From my list, what is the next activity I should execute?” 
 you have to be smart in choosing what to focus on first. If it is a simple task, you can go straight to the next step.
But in our lives, many tasks are complex and require several small activities to 
.
If the task is simple, skip to the next step. If the task is more complex and will require it to be broken into several smaller tasks, you need to add it to a new list called Projects.
In the Projects list, you must break this item across all its sub-items. With the sub-items set, return the most important ones to your main list. The list of projects is a list of all open circuits that require more than one task to complete.
A good example would be to have a “Rent apartment” project, and its subtasks would be “Visit real estate”, “Choose apartments to visit”, “Visit apartments”, “Make an offer to real estate”.
The projects list is a tool for tracking the open circuits you are still working on.
When you complete all the sub-tasks of a project, you can take it out of the project list. When new tasks appear in the project, such as “Find cosigner for the contract”, add it to the project list.
 Work on small tasks. This step is to ask yourself, “Can I complete this task in a single action and in less than two minutes?” Simple tasks like the examples below can be executed immediately.
Answer a question from a co-worker; Fill out a short survey form; Schedule a meeting; And if you can complete it right away, why not finish it now and clear your brain of that open circuit?
 Delegate what is not your job / It is not the best use of your time. After the immediate tasks, the easy and fast, it is time to know how to handle the tasks a little more complex, it is time to prioritize them.
The first question should be: Am I the best person to carry out this activity or 
 (family, friends, etc.)? If it makes sense to delegate this activity, go ahead and do it.
Once you have delegated a task, you must schedule the date on which you want to check the progress of the task. If you choose to perform the task, put it on your list of upcoming actions. The list of upcoming actions is timely planning, which ideally should be closed early in the day so you can be productive and do the most you can.
 Organizing your list of upcoming tasks. You should constantly revisit your list of upcoming tasks. The two most common ways of organizing it are by context and by priority.
To organize your list by context, ask yourself, “Where do I need to be to accomplish this task?”
Contexts can be physical locations such as your office, your home or the supermarket, but they can also be specific situations, already pre-occupied daily or weekly in your schedule.
A good example of situation context would be to have a fixed time in your agenda, from 8-am to 9-am called “email management”, or “internal meetings.” For each context, you must create a task list.
Organizing by context helps you, regardless of what you’re doing, to look at your list of upcoming actions and see what you need to do where you are.
Priority organization, however, must be done differently.
It is necessary to ask yourself, “Given my context, time and energy available, 
?”
Another important point is to consider the tasks according to your long-term goals.
Allen also suggests that you familiarize yourself with the Eisenhower Matrix of prioritization, which is based on the urgency and importance of the tasks (google this or read the article above!).
Now that you’ve created your list of upcoming actions and organized them by context and priority, you’re ready to get started. Roll up your sleeves to perform the most complex and hairy tasks.
Still, you’ll have tasks popping up in your calendar (the ones you delegated and checked to check in Step 5), so plan to have time for them as well. If during an execution time some new task begins to distract 
, put it on your list of open circuits so that you can return to it later.
The last step is the constant review of our lists and there are three essential analyzes that should become a habit so that we can keep our circuits constantly in the tracks. Here they are:
Allen’s method suggests six “horizons of focus”:
What is so great about this process is that there isn’t a recipe for everyone and you can customize the process so that it fits your personality and your work mechanisms.
You can choose a number of lists that you want to have, the way to organize your calendar, the amount of technology you want to involve.
You have to take into consideration some basic guiding lines, but most of it can be tailored to your specific needs.
 is a mechanism that will help you store, track and retrieve information at any given moment and in this way you will no longer feel stressed that you might forget some important details.
What you need to keep in mind 
, is the fact that it needs to be broken down into actions.
For example, if you just write: planning vacation, this is not something that will make you take further action. You need to think about the specific steps and what is the next 1-2 concrete steps that you need to take: a. decide about location, b. announce your boss that you need a vacation leave, c. book tickets etc.
“Project” is a very general term and as the author puts it:
If you keep these suggestions in mind and you start even with only small changes, you will see the difference in the way you respond to tasks and the way you organize in a matter of days.
This book is one of the best I’ve read when it comes to time/action 
 and it really helped me to become a more focused and organized person.
I began to apply the ideas presented while I was reading it and although I did not reach the point of having a full purge of my office and all my documents, I still feel better about the way I organize my day to day activities and I became more productive.
Key Lessons from “Getting Things Done”
1.      Managing limited resources

2.      Look from another perspective

3.      Workflow Mastery
Managing limited resources
You only have 24 hours each day, make the best out of that time. Well-equipped managers must be able to efficiently allocate expendable resources.
If you consider yourself as one, start by identifying only the most essential activities and avoid working on others. Define each project’s steps and follow them thoroughly.
Look from another perspective
Not knowing whether the job is completed or not, is the worst case scenario. Adopting new attitude on how to get things done efficiently must be a priority for any company.
Believe in change, and train the other employees to follow your example.
Workflow Mastery
Don’t let life control you, beat the system and become your own master.
There are several stages, which will assist you in managing life by valuing all those things that are worthy of your attention and combining them into a well-organized framework of activities.

The Pitfalls of Comparing Yourself to Others
Unfortunately, most of us are unhappy with our lives; there’s always something more than what we have that we strive for, something extra we desperately want.
The problem?
Even the ones who we think have it all are probably as much as unhappy as we are; 
 for the simple reason that happiness seems to be a relational category.
In other words, if everybody around you is poor, then chances are you’ll be much happier with what you have – even if that is nothing more than smithereens in comparison to what you have now.
That’s why most of 
.
Don’t believe us?
Well, here’s a story for you.
Imagine a businessman taking a woman named Abby, a good friend of his, out to lunch. He’s “wildly successful”: he has practically everything you’ll never even dream of having.
So much, in fact, that he’s not only taking Abby out in a limousine, but he’s also blessed with the privilege of being able to point out to her (in the backseat of that lavish car) his name on the Forbes 400 list.
Congratulations are in order, right?
Well, of course.
But, just a few moments later, the guy “[explodes] in indignation when he [notices] one of his competitors listed twenty places ahead of him.”	
“How could that jerk possibly beat me!” – he exclaims.
Now, Abby is a friend of Janice Kaplan, the author of 
And the story above is only one of the many Janice shares with her readers to explain what’s the problem with humans.
Put in the simplest terms, we tend to sabotage ourselves; and it’s time we stopped.
“Never compare,” writes Kaplan, “just appreciate what you have.”
What Natural Selection Has to Say on the Matter
is a doubly personal book: not only it contains a plethora of personal stories, and it chronicles a year in the life of the author (more on that below), but it also includes the findings of many studies which Kaplan uses to scientifically back her plea for gratitude.
In one of them, none other than 
 explains why we ruminate on the wrong things and tend to neglect the right ones.
In fact, it is precisely because of this capability that our ancestors managed to survive and leave after them descendants that eventually gave birth to your mother and father.
Can’t make the connection?
Let us make it for you!
Imagine yourself living in the Stone Age, bereft not only of Google but also of absolutely anything that may help you get by.
Now, imagine coming across a bushy tree overflowing with shiny brightly-colored berries.
Would you have one straight away, or would you resist the temptation?
Chances are you’ll probably stay away – just like you would even today if you don’t have your phone or your books with you and you happen upon a few tasty-looking mushrooms.
Why?
Because they might be poisonous.
But how would anyone learn if something is poisonous or not if nobody tried it?
Well, he/she wouldn’t; but if only one does try it and he falls sick/dies or is well enough to tell the story, then everyone may find out the truth.
Obviously enough, remembering the 
 poisonous berry (and telling your friends about it) is much more important than describing the ten tasty ones.
Fast forward hundreds of thousands of years and you can see the problem.
Namely, we still remember and talk about the poisonous berries much more than the tasty ones.
The Case for 
And that’s how 2015 started for the American novelist, TV producer and magazine editor, Janice Kaplan.
Author or coauthor of a dozen books (two of which 
 
 bestsellers), Kaplan was also editor-in-chief of the 
magazine when a rather dismal New Year’s Eve completely changed her outlook on life.
After hearing a woman talking about the poisonous berries in her life, Janice decided that she’s had it enough; not with that woman, but with her own grousing and grumbling and griping.
So, she decided for one of the simplest and (as she discovered herself) most powerful New Year’s resolutions one could make.
Realizing that despite her loving family and her dynamic career, she wasn’t that much different from that woman at the New Year Eve’s party, Kaplan resolved to “spend the coming year seeing the sunshine instead of the clouds.”
In other words, she decided to become her own social scientist, choosing one area of her life to focus on every single month of the year; she started with her husband and her family (she focused on them during the winter), and then she moved on to her material belongings and her career (she focused on them during the spring.
For the summer months of 2015, Kaplan was grateful for her health and (we’re going a bit meta here) her gratitude; finally, during the autumn months, she dealt with the three C’s: coping, caring and connecting.
Throughout the year, she kept a gratitude journal in which she wrote every night at least one thing she felt most grateful about during that day.
The Results of the Experiment
Let’s face it: you don’t need this book to know that feeling grateful is a lot better than feeling grumpy; not because 
 or because 
, but because, deep down inside you, you’ve felt it on more than one occasion yourself.
Upon relating her resolution to her husband Ron, Janice heard from him what she had always feared: “You probably don’t appreciate what you have as much as you should,” he said to her. “You pay too much attention to what’s wrong rather than what’s right.”
So, she started turning things around; and the relationship with her husband seemed like the best place to start.
“When you expect everything,” notes Kaplan aptly, “it’s hard to be grateful for anything. So. I decided that now was the time to put aside impossible expectations and start appreciating [my] husband.”
After a few passing remarks expressing her appreciation of him, she realized that things are changing between them; to her amazement, the warm feelings between them became “stronger than ever.” Gratitude, she concludes, “was making [them] both a lot happier.” 
So, naturally, Kaplan moved on from here to the relationships with her adult children and her career. When she felt ready, she instituted a “no-complaining zone.” 
And she stuck to it.
Until one day she was ready to even reconcile with her sister, with whom she eventually succeeded in beginning a “new friendship,” based on “appreciating the good in the moment rather than fussing about the past.”
Yup, we 
 think that there’s something in this book that can remind one of 
.
Epilogue, or a Few Words on Stoicism
As we said above, 
is a doubly personal book, since it includes both personal stories and personal research.
And though, in essence, it can be summed up in a single imperative sentence – “be grateful for the good things you have in your life!” – the book is filled with so many thought-provoking ideas about how one should live his/her life that we had no choice but to offer you this alternative summary (that doesn’t mimic the structure of the book).
One thing that really struck us, however, was the fact that Kaplan’s gratitude experiment bears so many similarities to 
.
“If you can change something that’s making you unhappy,” writes Kaplan channeling Epictetus through her, “go ahead and change it. But if it’s done, gone, or inevitable, what greater gift can you give yourself than gratitude for whatever life did bring?”
Epictetus – Kaplan’s guide through many parts of this gratitude year by her own admission – taught that “we can be most content if we focus on what is in our power.”
We can’t stop the rain to go on a picnic – no matter how much we try; so, then why feeling bad because of it.
“I had started the year making myself… unhappy by looking at what I lacked,” writes Kaplan in the conclusion of 
“After this year, I understood that coming from a position of gratitude, you could still want (and get) more for yourself, your family, your career or the world. But you enjoyed more along the way.” 
Key Lessons from “The Gratitude Diaries”
1.      Happiness Is a Relational Category
2.      You Are Programmed to Be Grumpy
3.      Gratitude Is Attitude… and It Can Change Your Life
Happiness Is a Relational Category
According to many studies, the main reason why you’re unhappy is a fairly simple one: you focus on the things you lack instead of focusing on the things you own.
The risk?
Even if you are Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos, you’ll feel poor if when you fall to the fifth place of the Forbes 400 list – because there will be four guys in front of you.
Contrary to what so many books argue, happiness is not something you can acquire; 
.
You Are Programmed to Be Grumpy
Make no mistake: you’re comparing yourself to others because, evolutionary, that’s exactly what has helped you get to where you are.
Complaining about what doesn’t work in your life is also beneficial in terms of natural selection: remembering the poisonous berry is much more important than remembering the tasty ones; it’s also much important to share the first story with the others.
In fact, as Gregory Clark argues in 
, “those who were successful in the economy of the Malthusian era could well have been driven by a need to have more than their peers in order to be happy. Modern man might not be designed for contentment. The envious have inherited the earth.”
Gratitude Is Attitude… and It Can Change Your Life
Janice Kaplan thinks otherwise: it’s time we left envy behind us and allow gratitude within us.
chronicles her experiment – inspired by a survey funded by the John Templeton Foundation on the idea of gratitude – to keep a gratitude diary every single day of her life and start being appreciative of the things she has instead of envious of those she doesn’t have.
“We get used to something,” she writes at one place, “and then forget why it seemed so special in the first place.”
Being grateful means remembering those parts of the story.
The final results are more than pleasing: gratitude makes life not only much more enjoyable but also worthwhile.

Stephen King was born in Maine, where he still lives with his novelist wife, Tabitha. In

She’s his Ideal Reader, from whom he gets most of his advice. He sees something in her that he also sees in himself: he does what he knows, and also knows how to do it.
“On Writing PDF Summary – Stephen King”
The author attempts to show how one writer was formed – himself. Like most good story ideas, Stephen King came out of nowhere.
According to the book writing is telepathy because writers are made for writing the truth – at least, the best ones are. Stephen King claims that one can only write from his or her own experiences.
As long as experiences are gained from honest, real situations, readers will seek to find characters that mirror their own lives. And this is where telepathy begins, according to King.
The door must be closed while a person writes, and open if the same individual rewrites. Your struggle begins with you – within you, afterward, it is advisable to take that battle somewhere else.
What is the most important rule when writing a book to which the author of “
” Stephen King refers to? Simply accuracy.
Take this situation for example – How would you feel if you find out – the story or facts that you are reading are inaccurate? You already know the answer to this question.
There is one funny anecdote – To be a writer, you must have a very boring life. However, being a writer doesn’t make you an introvert. This book summary covers the most important parts of the book, which according to our team can make a lot of difference.
Life is one of those terms that humans still haven’t figure it out its definition. Writing is not just a part of life; it is life. You cannot underestimate its power by identifying it with some sort of support system; it has to take all the credit. Think of it like any other art – writing is truly a gift from our ancestors.
 is also a so-called driving license for creating good works. It differs from typical writing guidebooks because it’s filled with the author’s own memories and experiences. There is also a chapter called “C.V.”, which introduces the reader to his 
and gives ideas on 
.
The chapter “What Writing Is” deals with King’s main concept: a book is more valuable if the reader can find similarities to his or her own life. In order to create this telepathy, the writer should have all the tools.
The next chapter, “Toolbox”, gives you a hint of what to put into practice. This means lots of practice. Grammar is not always enough. 
.
The main chapter, entitled “On Writing”, describes the job of a writer: write what you see. King compares writing to mathematics, except here the formula is 
Feel free to use words that you might never find in dictionaries; the same applies to long words. But never complicate things: “Never use ‘emolument’ when you mean ‘tip”.
Stephen King has a good sense of humor. I think it’s mostly because he writes what he thinks. One of my favorite quotes is: “If your master’s thesis is no more organized than a high school essay titled 
, you’re in big trouble”.
And the biggest question is always whether your story is coherent. King says you should never use difficult words written in baroque style.
Whenever you meet a dead-end, remind yourself: 
If we know how to handle our tools, we know how to write. King believes you should never start a book with questions. However, there is something special about a book that makes you hungry for answers from the very start. The best books reflect the readers’ lives.
We learn from our own mistakes. Even best-selling authors get it wrong sometimes; what makes them successful is that they learn from the experience, and improve their craft in the process.
The last chapter, entitled “On Living: A Postscript”
is written from the author’s personal view and experience. King encourages the reader to do one thing: be brave and start writing.
There are many unpublished books that ought to see the light of day, but whose authors are too afraid to publish them. One has to be brave, 
 of what other people may say or think.
From my personal point of view, I think all masterpieces reflect the creator. You can only share something if you have something to share. That requires a lot of reading and a lot of writing. Without any practice, you cannot improve your skills.
It’s also about the style and shape and length of the work. King considers the paragraph the most important part of writing, instead of the sentence.
Everyone is free to think and decide for themselves because it’s the only way to learn and improve ourselves.
We sometimes do not understand life and its negative aspects, but everyone reaches a point when all the pieces fall together. I do believe that everything happens for a reason.
The paths that lead us to success might be full of dead ends. Stephen King had a hard childhood and his career had a rough start.

Is a gun more dangerous than a swimming pool? How much of an impact do parents really have on a child’s life? Did the legalization of abortion lead to a sharp decrease in crime?
These aren’t typical questions about economics, but then Steven Levitt isn’t your typical economist.
Together with award-winning writer and journalist Stephen Dubner, Levitt wrote 
 as a way to explore the hidden side of everything from gangs and real-estate agents to cheating and the Ku Klux Klan.
This is not a book about economics. Rather, it’s a book that applies economic theories to other subjects. And the conclusions Levitt and Dubner come to may surprise you. 
, in its own words, turns “conventional wisdom on its head”.
INCENTIVES / FREAKONOMICS
Levitt and Dubner argue that morality represents the way we would like the world to work, and economics shows how it actually works.
They explore subjects that may, at times, seem strange (it’s not called 
for nothing) to redefine the way we look at our world.
From a chapter on why the socioeconomic and racial status of parents affects how they name their children, to why parenting skills are overrated or why drug dealers have a tendency to live with their mothers, it’s a fun and interesting – and sometimes controversial – read.
At its heart, 
 is a study of incentives – how people get what they want (or need) even when others want the same thing. And what Levitt and Dubner show above all is the importance of asking creative questions.

“Freakonomics Summary”
Freakonomics is a collaboration of authors Steven Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, journalists and winners of numerous awards. The authors seek to find simple answers to complicated world problems.
Freakonomics tries to decipher everyday events from an economic perspective by exploring various events, such as drug dealers lives, the truth about real estate brokers, and the influence of parenting on children’s future.
Authors Levitt and Dubner present the economics of daily life telling different stories with irony.
The authors show, through the study of incentives, how the economy influences how individuals get what they want.
They also explore the secret side of things and, also, question the validity of modern wisdom, presenting a valuable and different perspective, using concrete data.
Freakonomics offers an unconventional premise: if morality shows how the world should work, economics shows how it actually works.
Freakonomics will redefine how you see the modern world and make you question various widely held assumptions. 
?
Does your name influence your success? How does legalizing abortion influence a country’s crime rate?
This book seeks to bring the answers to these questions in a way never before seen, helping you to think about other issues from another perspective.
People cheat all the time, even those who say they don’t cheat. 
 and all kinds, who are usually honest, will resort to cheating to advance their careers or make more money if the incentive to cheat is great.
Apparently silly things, such as skip a line or stealing a point in a volleyball game, for example, may be recurring if the incentives work in favor of cheating.
Economists believe in the power of incentives. In fact, economics bases itself on the study of incentives.
An incentive is anything that induces a person to do a task or take action. 
 believe that all economic problems can be solved through these incentives.
But they will also tell you that the solution may not please everyone. For example, a standard solution to illegal street parking is to give traffic tickets.
These traffic tickets are not at all popular, but they solve the problem by giving drivers an incentive not to park illegally. So an incentive can exist in many ways, not all of them positive.
However, just as right encouragement can force individuals to obey the rules, the wrong incentive can encourage them to cheat. For example, in the United States, standardized school exams have become a common practice in public schools.
With the goal of promoting better education, the No Child Left Behind rewards schools that improve their test scores and penalizes those with failing scores.
Because there is a tangible benefit in achieving good test scores and (perhaps even more importantly) a distinct disadvantage in having poor results, there is a great incentive for teachers to cheat.
Some teachers may feel tempted to substitute the wrong answers for their students’ right answers, and thus their schools perform better.
The incentive to have good results and avoid bad ones can overcome the fear of doing something wrong or the risk of being caught.
When you imagine a drug dealer, you may think of an armed person who has access to a significant amount of money. If they have that kind of money, then why do most traffickers still live with their mother?
You only believe that drug dealers live dangerous lives surrounded by money because you have absorbed this information from popular wisdom.
Traditional wisdom is usually a belief, opinion or judgment about an individual issue, already accepted by society.
The problem is that once knowledge is recognized as popular wisdom, it is tough to correct it, even if its premise is false.

Social and economic behaviors are complex, and their understanding can be complicated. Therefore, 
 that are already common.
Traditional wisdom is usually introduced by leading thinkers or experts in a particular industry, but these experts often make their observations and assumptions without ever checking the facts.
These conclusions, then, are passed on to other specialists, who lend authority to the argument.
The answer to why a typical drug dealer still lives with his mother was discovered by Sudhir Venkatesh, who spent six years with a gang in Chicago, studying their habits.
He found that the reason most drug dealers still lived with their mothers was simply 
.
The crack cocaine trader in the gang studied by Venkatesh earned only $ 3.30 per hour, which is insufficient for his livelihood.
So why do they continue in this challenging and dangerous work? The answer is not financial.
Drug gangs are like businesses: they have a pyramid-like organizational format, based on a hierarchy.
People in the base of the pyramid (the street workers) have the difficult task of selling drugs and participating in gang wars, hoping that one day they will climb to the top of the pyramid, where there are big rewards.
So the reality is that, contrary to popular belief, drug dealers do not make much money. That shows that what most people believe to be the truth may not always be the case.
Crime in the U.S.A. has dropped significantly in the 1990s. Several factors are associated with this decline, including an increase in the number of police officers, an increase in penalties for criminals and a change in the drug market.
But what about abortion? Could legalizing abortion be a contributing factor to this decline?
Nicolae Ceausescu became a dictator in Romania in 1966. A year later, he made abortion illegal. He thought it could make Romania stronger by increasing the population of the country.
The only women who were allowed to abort were those who already had four children and those in a high position in the Communist Party.
The pressure on women was so intense that government officials forced them to take pregnancy tests on the job. Women who did not get pregnant were forced to pay a celibacy tax.
Within a year, the birth rate in Romania doubled. Under the dictatorial regime of Nicolae Ceausescu, ordinary people of Romania lived a miserable life.
However, the consequences were worse for children born after the abortion ban: they were worse off than those born a year earlier, including their schooling achievements and their success at work.
After abortion became illegal in Romania, more children were born in poverty and were, therefore, more likely to engage in criminal activity.
If the ban on abortion can lead to increased crime, it is not difficult to apply the same logic to explain why crime is declining in the United States.
It may be that there are fewer unwanted children. 
 have access to abortion, children who are born have better prospects in life and are less likely to engage in crime for economic reasons.
Real estate brokers make a lot of money at the expense of asymmetric informational. They need to use insider information 
 to buy or sell real estate. Consider for a moment that you want to sell your home.
Selling a home is not a routine transaction, and you may not know much about the real estate market. One of your biggest problems will be the price of the house.
If you assign a meager price on your home, you may not get the money you deserve. But if your price is too high, your home may not be sold. So, what do you do?
In this scenario, your best option is to contact a broker. Before the emergence of the Internet, they were the only ones who had information on the real estate market.
They were in a good position to advise you on the home’s current market value.
However, they could also manipulate this information in their favor, to make their customers afraid of losing a good sale if they delayed.
Nowadays, thanks to the Internet, buyers and 
.
They have become clients with much more knowledge, and the result is that the broker’s advantage has diminished considerably.
In the same way, life insurance companies made a lot of money before the arrival of the Internet. In the past, customers had no way of knowing if the companies were offering the best prices or the best policies.
Therefore, the cost of life insurance was very high. When the Internet began offering comparisons between plans, customers were able to find cheaper policies quickly.
That has increased competition among insurance companies, which has caused prices to fall.
We see then that the power and influence of insurance companies or real estate companies depend on exclusive information. When exclusivity no longer exists, their power reduces or disappears.
Compare the story of two children. One is a white boy and the other a black kid. The white boy’s parents have high school degrees, and the father has a good job.
His mother is a housewife and holds a university degree. The boy lives a happy life and does well in high school.
The black boy’s mother abandoned him when he was two. His father has a good job in retail, but he drinks a lot and often hits the kid when he’s drunk. One day the boy sees his father beating a woman.
She is beaten so badly that she loses some of her teeth. The kid does not do well in high school, starts selling drugs and gets in trouble often.
He makes sure to be in his bed before his father comes home from work and leaves the house before his father wakes up in the morning.
Eventually, his father is arrested for sexual assault. At twelve, the boy needs to support himself.
What do you think will happen to these two boys? How will their future be? 
.
It does not matter if the child was taken to museums, was given timeout when he did something wrong or if he had a television.
That does not mean that parenting is not important, but the fact is that when parents finally learn what is right for their children, it is too late.
How your child will do in the future depends on factors decided many years before, such as your identity, the person you marry, and the kind of life you have.
Smart, educated, hard-working, well-paid individuals who marry such people are also more likely to have successful children. Being honest, kind and curious, also helps. For your kids to succeed, it does not depend so much on what you do when you are a parent, but on who you are.
In 1958, a New York resident named Robert Lane had a son. He decided to call his son “Winner” (Winner). Three years later, he had another child and called him “Loser” (Loser). What do you think happened to the boys?
Loser Lane has achieved success in his life. He attended a preparatory school with a scholarship, went to Pennsylvania’s Lafayette University and later joined the New York police force. He was promoted to detective and eventually to sergeant.
His older brother, Winner, also stood out, but in the wrong way. The only thing he got was a long criminal record.
So the question arises: does a child’s name influence their eventual economic success? The answer is “no.”
A child’s name does not affect how they will perform in the future. 
.
Otherwise, why bother raising your kids the right way? And it is true that most parents will name their kids thinking about the success they will achieve in the future.
Note that there is also a random effect that influences both the best and the worst parents.
As a result, there are devout and intelligent parents who have children who are unsuccessful, just as there are successful children regardless of their parents’ terrible habits and intentions (such as naming their child “Loser”).
To demonstrate this, let’s go back a bit. Do you remember the two boys from the previous session? These kids had very different beginnings in life.
The black boy is Roland G. Fryer Jr, a famous economist, while the white boy is Ted Kaczynski, the serial killer known as “Unabomber.” Looking at their education, we certainly would not have foreseen it.

“Freakonomics” Quotes
Final Notes:
Freakonomics questions common principles and brings unusual answers. It has been proved, for example, that teachers cheat when incentives outweigh the risks of being caught.
Before the Internet arrived, insurance companies and real estate brokers were both very successful because they had privileged information.
Contrary to popular belief, drug dealers do not make a lot of money and live miserable lives.
The right to an abortion caused crime to fall because mothers had the choice of whether or not to have a baby and children were born with better standards of living.
When it comes to parenting, it is more important who the parents are than what they do.
Levitt and Dubner have shown that data is relevant, that incentives guide modern society and that collective wisdom may not have any basis at all.
They also argue that economic principles can be applied to everyday problems. Freakonomics features several pearls of wisdom, providing a new insight and understanding of everyday problems."

: 
Finding positivity from within will invigorate your life. Allocate a couple of minutes right after you wake up, to send these affirmations back to the Universe. Do it again before bedtime and reap the benefits as you move.
: 
Your life doesn’t resemble anyone else’s. Put down on a piece of paper two of your unique personal skills and explain why do you enjoy expressing those qualities.
In the end, make a statement.
: 
How would you describe success?
Make an “I want” list, and outline everything that makes you feel happy while doing it. Find a peaceful place and try to be as specific as possible.
: 
People are taught to behave along the lines of expectancy. If you have negative experience about doing something, you’ll likely be hesitant to try it one more time.
Two things stopping you from experiencing prosperity: The fear of the unknown, and your knowledge. 
: 
Your brain is not designed to be stuck in the mediocre middle; tilted in neither way. It’s made to achieve goals, and solve problems. 
Eradicate terms like: I can’t, it’s too hard, in order to make that a living reality.
: 
Positive mindset = Positive outcome. I mean, let’s be realistic here – Have you ever seen a depressed person enjoy life? – No, because when you radiate negativity, you get what you pay for. 
The same applies the other way around.
: 
Be clear about your goals, because otherwise, you can’t accomplish them. Visualize the life upon achieving those objectives, and understand the big picture.
Prior to that, make sure that you set the right goals.
: 
This process is pretty self-explanatory. It’s in your best interest to break down the large goals into smaller ones in order to improve your execution. 
Plan your day the night before, and allow your mind to really work out the details.
: 
Success is by no means random. People with high-energy are always on full alert when someone else is speaking about their goals, and they try to absorb as much as information as possible.
On top of that, to achieve extraordinary results, you need to take action.
: 
Releasing the brakes refers to the temerity to let go of meaningless concepts. The limited mindset is one of the biggest obstacles on your path to prosperity. 
Work on expanding your comfort zone, day in and day out.
: 
See it, to achieve it. Imagination is more powerful than knowledge, and that has been proven over and over again. 
Before hitting the rack, read your list of goals, and try to visualize your success in reaching them. 
: 
Act as if nothing can stop you. If we conflate belief with action, we get that winning mentality. So much about victimhood, as we transform our mindset by being self-confident and eager to succeed.
: 
You don’t need to lay down a comprehensive blueprint – just take the first step! Mistakes should not be construed as unwanted experiences but as much-needed lessons.
Embrace feedback, and hustle!
: 
As you accept unlimited liability for your life, you are not ignorant of the fact that you might end up someplace better. 
Where you want to go, it is not always the best place you can be. 
: 
Don’t let fear stand in the way of action. Fear is just a form of inner resistance, nothing to get particularly upset about. 
Replace those tendencies with images of positive affirmation.
: 
Are you? Well, not many people are, but if you can’t pay the price, and you can’t carry the burden, you don’t deserve success.
Delve yourself into the richness of life, and utilize every available ounce of strength to see it through.
: 
If you are asking to get a “No,” then you better keep quiet. If you stop asking questions, you’ll be dragged into misery.
Ask until you get a “Yes.”
: 
Rejection is nothing but a form of encouragement. Asking with confidence transforms even the bitterest rejection into a profound experience.
: 
What’s your attitude toward feedback? 
If you are keen to move forward and paddle your way to the top, then you must apply the valuable feedback delivered at your doorsteps.
: 
Nothing can stop me as long as I am working harder than everyone else! 
You are getting better by the day because the big tasks are chunked down into digestible assignments.
: 
If you lean on gut instinct to get an 
, you’ll soon realize the mistake. 
Keep score of your progress, define KPIs, track these metrics, and you’ll get to the bottom of every problem.
: 
There’s no such thing as – Recline in your chair, and everything that is yours will come to you. 
Always be on the lookout for better ways to improve your position, and find alternative routes that can lead you to success.

The rule of 5 evinces the excitement of 
.
Jack underlines five specific actions that ought to be executed in the following day, as a method of getting closer to his goals.
: 
Stand out from the rest, by over-delivering on your promises, and exceeding your personal expectations.
It all boils down to the idea of putting a little bit of extra effort each day.
: 
The old adage is true – your circle of friends defines who you are. 
If you are surrounded by goal-oriented individuals, that’s exactly what will give you the impetus to push forward.
: 
Encourage your 
 to achieve greater goals by praising the smaller ones. 
You have to be proud and feel elevated whenever you achieve a goal, regardless of its magnitude.
: 
Keep your eyes on the mark?
Bring more focus to each task, until you can truly say that you are living in the moment.
: 
When will the good things come to pass?
Right about the time you clean up the mess that is going on in your head. 
: 
If you can’t make peace with your past, you will be unable to see the good side of the future.
By handling the painful memories, you are creating the future you’d like to live in. 
: 
If something isn’t working, you have to pluck up your courage and find the remedy.
You cannot improve your life if you are unwilling to take risks and work your way through tough situations.
: 
Allow those thoughts into your mind that resonate with the person you’d like to become.
Your mind can be either your best friend or your worst enemy. It’s up to you!
: 
 that occurs after repeatedly doing something.
If your mind becomes accustomed to things that predict success, then you’re on the right track. 
: 
Are you giving 100% when carrying out the daily assignments or are you more into procrastination?
Be honest with yourself, and practice the “no exceptions” rule to get everything done. 
: 
Are you committed to lifelong learning? 
The people who are can be counted on one’s fingers!
: 
You cannot be a failure if you are following your passion and allowing that eagerness to sustain you.
Enthusiasm and determination when weaved together, represent the most powerful engine for achieving your goals.
: 
Be smart with regards to the delegation of tasks. 
Focus on the core, and let others do the trivial things. 
: 
Balance out the time spent on work, family, relationships, etc.
Management of time is slowly turning into the biggest issue of the modern age.
: 
Well, this is the hard part. 
There are literally thousands of minor distractions that are stealing our time. It’s time we say “No” to them!
: 
Do you want to be a leader? Then, present yourself as a person of ideas, and as an individual who has a lot to offer.
Some say that there’s a genetic factor in being a leader, but that’s just utter nonsense.
: 
No one knows everything. 
If you create a valuable network of achievers, you’ll be compelled to push forward and influence others to do likewise.
: 
There’s some magic in aligning with a group of likely-thinkers. 
Then you can work as a team in extracting energy and power from above.
: 
Are you ready to connect with the higher-sense of self through meditation, discipline and inner guidance?
If you become spiritually attuned, you’ll much more easily spot opportunities and ward off enemies.
: 
It’s needless to say that the elements of productive intercourse are rooted in active listening.
Try not to judge while doing it, and remain neutral. 
: 
Are you ready to take the next step in the conversation?
Jack believes that “Heart Talk” or freely expressing your feelings has a crucial role in that matter.
: 
Some say that radical truth is better than pleasant lies. And we cannot agree more!
Bring up the critical issues, call out the instigators and deal with the predicament as quickly as possible.
: 
You are in control of the words you utter, so use them with caution.
On top of that, impeccability is just the path leading to abundance and prosperity.
: 
Bear in mind that lavishing praise upon someone is an act to be admired.
Learn to appreciate the efforts of others, and give them the respect they deserve.
: 
Elegance, as a feature can surely give you a boost in this world of ours.
Act with class, show dignity and respect when dealing with people. Become a role model by blazing a trail for others to follow.
: 
Don’t squander the money on meaningless pleasures. 
Make positive choices about what to do with the money you earn.
: 
Try to find out what lies at the bottom of your heart.
Focus on acquiring wealth if that’s your priority, and make sure that you have enough resources to fund your future lifestyle.
: 
Do you dream about being debt-free?
Don’t ever stop thinking about new ways to make money, and refrain yourself from spending money you didn’t earn.
: 
Every dollar you make is an opportunity for you as much as it is for the rest of the world to live in peace.
Jack argues that tithing a portion of the money you’ve earned to those in need will help you to feel even better.

Traction Summary,https://blog.12min.com/traction-pdf-summary/,,"12 min read ⌚ 
: 
Distribution is everything, and this is the subject addressed in the book.
Traction goes through some customer acquisition channels and helps you choose the best ones for your business.
Do not miss this microbook based on the original book. Let’s go?
“Traction PDF Summary”
If you have a startup, what matters most is getting to the customers. You need to master acquisition channels and thus prove the real growth of your business. Many beginner entrepreneurs believe that a good product sells itself.
Unfortunately, this is not true. You need consistent growth. You need traction.
You need a systematic approach, a method to keep growing and each time attracting more customers. Do not blindly repeat the techniques and tactics adopted by other companies.
Do not make ads or just create a blog because other companies are creating it. If you keep trying to grow without a clear strategy, you will end up broke, with no money and no users.
The method and plan are as important as the growth itself, and that is what Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares bring us in Traction.
Traction means you can acquire new customers in a predictable and scalable way. Imagine that you have launched a product and are beginning to acquire users. Growth is coming slowly, but it is difficult to control. These are initial signs of traction.
Your traction is measured by an indicator whose goal is to help you scale and scale your business. If you sell to businesses (B2B) for example, the first large contracts closed can be a traction indicator.
If your focus is on reaching the end consumer, traction can mean having to acquire thousands or hundreds of thousands of users.
Your traction should be measured by a clear, easy-to-follow indicator that should always be pointing up and to the right, after all, a startup exists to grow and traction.
There are dozens of channels and strategies adopted by companies to grow and you, 
, need to know how to prioritize them.
Only constant experiments and a lot of effort will tell you which ones are best for your startup.
(function(d,id){if(d.getElementById(id))return;var scr=d.createElement(‘script’);scr.src=’https://widget.12min.com/v0.2.0/widget.js’;scr.id=id;d.body.appendChild(scr);})(document,’12min-widget-sdk’);window.twelveminInit=function twelveminInit(){};

In this micro book, we will explore the 19 channels of customer acquisition most commonly used by startups from around the world.
Having a great product without a traction strategy is a common mistake, and every entrepreneur needs to avoid it. In a startup, customer acquisition must always be played in parallel with the development of the product itself.
You cannot expect your product to be ready to go. You need to divide your time between product development and demand generation for it.
Dedicate 50% of your time to the product itself and focus the remaining 50% on making sure your product is reaching users.
To have traction, you need a product that people enjoy, but without traction, you will not be able to know if people really like your product. That is why it is essential that both go hand in hand.
Growing a startup is challenging, and they all start with slow growth. In the beginning, you need to do things that do not scale, and that is extremely manual.
After this phase, the company begins to have a more consistent growth, associated with the discovery of a first associated channel. When this channel becomes saturated, growth slows down, and it is time to find new channels.
Therefore, Gabriel and Justin propose a method of channel discovery called the Bullseye framework.
For startups, at different times in their life cycle, different channels need to be used. The Bullseye framework helps the entrepreneur find the right channel for a company as it stands.
The Bullseye is a model visually represented by a target, with 3 tracks. There are 3 concentric circles, and each represents an important part of the process of searching for new channels. These include:
The entrepreneur must always focus on the main channel and, at each stage of the business, there is a channel that should receive more attention, after all, it brings the majority of customers. Gabriel suggests that you always focus on one channel at a time.
By focusing on multiple channels, the effort of the entrepreneur (who already has few resources) is diluted, and this makes the company have multiple acquisition channels malfunctioning, without optimization.
By focusing on only one, it is possible to optimize that channel to the maximum until its saturation, so that other channels can be prioritized.
To achieve traction, you need to use the Bullseye framework to identify the channels most likely to bring growth to a startup. That is done through continuous testing. Select the channels in the middle of the Bullseye, and do little experiments to see if those channels are really promising and deserve more investment.
Try, for example, buying ads on Google and find out if that channel’s return on investment is profitable for your business.
The tests should always focus on validating the profitability of that channel and also on discovering what works and what doesn’t, after all, you can have multiple strategies on the same channel. Discovery tests are meant to help you find new strategies for that channel.
Once the channel works, it is moved to the center, and you should do optimization testing. For example, if Google ads are working, you can test different ads, different 
, or even different keywords to improve your performance further.
Optimization tests are focused on 
 of that channel. If the channel works, you should always look for new strategies to optimize performance, after all, channels become saturated over time, and you can not be surprised when this happens.
So you must always be testing new strategies and channels to ensure that you are in control of your growth.
To measure the success of your channels, you need to have the right tools, always collecting data about the users that came from each channel.
Do not start your experiments without reliable tools like Google Analytics or Mixpanel ready to measure the return of your channel experiments.
Create spreadsheets to track your performance by channel, always measuring and documenting your conversion rates from users to customers, the cost of acquiring that channel and the value of the customer throughout their life cycle for your company.
This worksheet helps you know if you are going in the right direction and how your channels are performing.
Also, you need to have traction goals. A traction goal, for example, would be to reach 1,000 paying users in a given month. All your efforts should be aligned with your traction goal and choosing the right goal is very important.
If you pursue new registered users, you will have a completely different result than if your goal is new paying users. Set your goals and focus on the channels that will take you to this goal in the smallest possible way.
Traction Channels
In this list, the authors present the 19 most used channels for startups to reach their customers. Let’s look at them:
Viral marketing consists of growing your user and customer base, encouraging your customers to recommend/invite other customers. In the book, the authors interviewed marketing expert Andrew Chen to find commonly used viral strategies.
For him, a startup becomes viral when a user brings at least one more user to use its product. If each user can bring in new users, this creates exponential growth.
Viral growth is hard to become sustainable, but it is the force behind some of the fastest growing companies in history, such as Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp.
A Public Relations (PR) strategy refers to when the company manages to control the media message about it efficiently and profitably.
The goal is to achieve broad media coverage, including newspapers, TV, and magazines, and thus attract new users and customers.
Many startups start thus, seeking to leave the major channels on their market and thus catch the attention of the audience of that publication.
To get the press’s attention, you need to give them a good story, facts that make it worth talking about.
For example, reaching a certain number of users or releasing a new version of your product may attract the interest of journalists and thus increase their visibility.
When done in an unconventional way, a PR strategy can produce even greater results. Do you know when Red Bull sends a parachute into space?
That’s what we’re talking about. You can do marketing stunts that catch the press’ attention, and this makes the media groups want to talk about you.
You can also create viral videos about your product or service, and if you can get people interested in your videos on YouTube, a publication might be interested in talking with you.
Another way to use public relations in an unconventional way is by encouraging your clients to talk about you.
That can be controlled in a more scalable way, through promotions, challenges, and awards that improve your brand awareness and generate repercussions in the press.
SEM or Search Engine Marketing relies on paying to advertise on search engines such as Google or Bing and bait clicks from potential users paying for it. PPC (Pay Per Click) ads allow you to reach users while they’re searching for keywords.
SEM tends to work well for people who sell directly to the end consumer by reaching the customer the moment he seeks solutions.
What’s important is always following the keywords you use, your click-through rate, and the effectiveness of your ads.
Display ads are those banners that you see on the websites you visit on the internet. Social ads already appear on your 
 or Twitter timeline, for example.
While search engine PPC ads seek to satisfy an interest the consumer has actively demonstrated through a search, display and social ads seek to generate demand for something customers did not know they needed.
People may not be buying at the moment, but they are always interested in learning new things.
Even today, companies are investing more in offline marketing than online. And to grow a business, there are dozens of offline channels that can work on acquiring customers.
TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, outdoor signs, are some of the possible examples. These channels can be used in scale, ranging from local campaigns to reaching an entire country. Few startups use this channel, which can mean less competition to reach these audiences.
Almost all internet users go to Google to research their questions. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is about optimizing your site’s pages, so they appear in Google results for these searches.
When a site has pages on your site that take away the user’s doubts, search engines tend to give good positions to these pages in the search, which gain wide exposure for an audience they intend to buy.
Just like in SEM strategy, these are visitors who are actively seeking solutions to their problems.
Having a blog can be a great channel for low-cost acquisition in startups. 
 is based on producing relevant content and creating an audience to consume this content. 
 allows companies to engage with people, and eventually, these readers end up becoming customers of your company.
Email marketing is one of the best tools to convert prospects into customers. Sending an email to your prospects makes them engage directly with your business and read your message.
Email is a personal channel and messages from a company appear alongside communications from your friends and family.
That is why email marketing is more efficient when it is relevant and personalized.
Your programming team can help your startup gain traction by creating tools that help you reach more people.
These tools can be 
, widgets and educational microsites that put your company in front of more potential customers.
Hubspot, for example, has created a tool that helps people evaluate and find potential problems on their websites. With this, thousands of people use this tool, end up knowing the company and becoming potential clients.
Focusing on appearing on blogs read by your customers is one of the most common strategies to reach your first customers.
Startups like the Codecademy, Mint, and Reddit started targeting blogs read by their target audience.
The Mint personal finance startup, for example, has focused on niche finance blogs since its inception. By getting these blogs to talk about the company, when they launched the product, tens of thousands of users were already interested in their product.
Business Development (BD) is the process of creating strategic relationships that help the company and its partners grow.
Unlike sales, when you focus directly on the customer, BD focuses on finding potential partners and joint activities that can benefit both parties.
In the process of business development, you need to know how to structure business, find partners and know how to approach them with mastery.
In the sales arena, the focus is on creating processes that reach prospects and get them to pay for your product.
In many cases, it is necessary to talk and take the potential client’s hand to become a real customer.
To scale through sales, you need to know how to create a funnel that generates leads, know how to qualify these leads, and have scalable processes to address and convert them.
An affiliate program consists of your company paying other people or companies to sell your product. Companies like 
, Zappos, eBay, Orbitz, and Netflix use affiliate marketing as a scalable revenue-generating channel. Affiliate programs, in general, are a high-performance channel for e-commerce shops and signature clubs.
Existing platforms are websites, applications or networks with large numbers of users that can be used to generate more traction for your startup. The top examples are the mobile app stores of Apple (Apple Store) and Google (Android Store).
Social networks like Facebook and Twitter are also platforms that can be used to find new customers.
The effort is based on understanding how these platforms work and how you can convert some of the millions of their users into new customers.
Being at a market fair gives you the chance to demonstrate your product in person. Initially, this can be a great channel for generating interest in your product or service.
As you grow, these spaces can also be great for announcing new products, features and closing deals with large companies.
Sponsoring or creating offline events can be a strong channel for customer acquisition. These events allow you to interact with customers and talk about their problems.
This channel can be especially useful when the company’s customers are not fully connected or engage in online advertising.
Attracting them to an event, in this case, can be the best way to approach them.
This channel works well if you can include an interesting pitch for the people in your talk. If the content takes action, public speaking about your product or service can be a consistent channel to bring new customers to your startup.
Eric Ries, for example, promoted his book 
 (check out the microbook here) through lectures and thus managed to get on the bestseller list.
Creating a community involves generating connections between your customers and bringing more people to talk about your business. Wikipedia, for example, has attracted millions of users by creating a community where people contribute content.
So did the startup Stack Exchange, which focused on building a developer community.

“Grace, Not Perfection PDF Summary”
If you want a summary of Emily Ley’s book in two words, then probably these two words are “balance” and “simplicity.”
If you want a summary of it in two sentences, then think along these lines: “I will hold myself to a standard of grace, not perfection;” and “By simplifying our lives, we’re making space for what matters—to hear God more clearly, to give more wholeheartedly, and to place our energy in people and hearts rather than in things.”
Finally, if you want a more extended summary of each of its three parts and fifteen chapters – then, read ahead!
Part 1: Grace with Yourself
If you are struggling to fill in the roles of being a good wife, an even better mother and a talented individual with a successful career, then it’s only natural that you’ve already asked yourself the dreaded question: “How do 
 do it?”
Emily Ley – just like 
, 
, and just about everybody – has a pretty straightforward answer to that question: they don’t.
“Even if you can do it all,” she writes, “no one can do it all well.”
The first lesson she learned on her road to happiness and bliss: we are all slaves of perfectionism because we have confused in our childhood the notion of being perfect with the idea of being worthy.
The latter is the only available standard.
And the easiest way to achieve this standard?
Well, just give yourself permission to just stop. Press pause as soon as possible, take a deep breath, and start analyzing your life. 
Have you ever done anything worthy – or even decent – when in a state of overcommitment?
Probably not!
Because it’s impossible to do 
 when your heart is filled with 
. “You can’t draw water from an empty well,” says Emily Ley.
And she makes a nice analogy:
 says, “outer order contributes to inner calm.”
Emily Ley adds: and outer order is all about three organizing systems:
1. Organizing your time;
2. Organizing your belongings;
3. Organizing your home.
As far as the organization of your time is concerned, you can’t do much better than consulting 
; and as far as the other two are in question, 
 might be the only guru you’ll ever need.
Everything is moving so fast around us that sometimes we forget what really matters.
The problem?
The only time we really come to our senses is when it’s already too late. 
How many stories do you know of people who are on their deathbeds and who are finally aware of how they spent too little time enjoying the great moments in life and too much of it ignoring them?
“We don’t have to wait until the end of life,” says Ley. “Right this moment, we can construct our schedules in a way that allows us to truly savor the good stuff in between the have-to’s of life.”
And the best way to do this:
Slow down.
And never sacrifice the good for the perfect.
“Perfection is overrated,” writes Ley. As all children know: “there is joy in the mess.”
So, stop worrying about everything going according to plan; it’s time that you embrace life in all of its randomness and unpredictability.
Sometimes things get messy, true. But, that’s the point: they will get messy no matter how much you try to avoid the messiness.
So, why don’t you just stop doing that?
From time to time – surrender control.
Part 2: Grace with Your People
How many times have you had quarrels with your loved one just because they didn’t do something according to your vision of life?
“Just like socks on the floor don’t equal major character flaws,” writes Emily Ley, “dishes in the sink shouldn’t always equal an argument.”
The point?
You’ll always have one or two things to argue about with your loved one; after all, both of you are individuals, and both of you have some expectations and dreams of freedom.
That’s why picking your battles is much smarter than fighting all of them.
If 
 yelling about socks on the floor gets you encouragement and a couple of warm hugs – then, really, should you even bother thinking about picking about the socks yourself?
Do you know why you should let go arguing about the socks?
Because you have some dirty laundry in your closet as well!
No matter how special they are to us – all of the people we know are flawed in one way or another; yes – that includes us.
And it is because of this that life is so rich; even though, it is also because of it that sometimes it’s just too circus-like.
“I’m slowly learning that my happiest, most special moments happen when the circus is at its peak,” writes Emily Ley.
Be aware of this sentence lest you learn this too late.
How many of your relationships are a burden to you?
What?!
Do you want to say that even the ones you have with your closest ones can be described in such a manner? But shouldn’t they be the very opposite?
Ley thinks she knows the problem: you are trying too hard.
Instead of letting yourself go and learning that good friendships are all about accepting each other’s imperfectness, you are trying to be perfect even in front of the ones who’d accept you the way you are.
Now, stop doing that immediately.
Instead, show yourself in all of your splendors and failings even in front of strangers; you can’t even imagine the relief!
Routines in relationships are something you will never be able to get out of; we can think of a few films when people tried doing that (say, 
) but that never turns up the way you’d expect it to.
Because the point is not doing away with routines in your relationships; it is choosing the ones you want. 
To find them, a good starting point should be unearthing those parts in life which bring you the most stress and anxiety.
Now think of a way to circumvent those through a routine; because, as you know full well, when you’re in the middle of the routine you do things mechanically and feel nothing.
The upside?
That includes stress and anxiety as well.
, there are things you can control in life and things you can’t.
“The chief task in life,” wrote one of them: “is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals and not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control.”
But what to do about the bad things that are not under your control?
Well, accept them: “You control your perspective and the state of your heart in the situation you’re in today – even when you can’t control the circumstances. Choose gratitude.”
Part 3: Grace in Your Calling
Back in your teenage years, you were infinite: in your mind, you were ready to become anything you want to, and the only thing you needed to do was choosing the right path.
If you are like 99% of the people, your path was all about your future job choice.
The problem?
Well, your job is only a part of your life!
What about your friends, your family, your hobbies, your dream vacations, your free time?
“We talk so much about choosing jobs or selecting careers,” writes Emily Ley. “But what if we chose a life instead? Whether you’re 17 or 75, you can define the life you want to have. Better yet, you can decide how you want to spend your days.”
Living the life you want to begins with defining it.
Think about that.
Of course, defining the life you want to is merely a part of it; it’s then when the real work starts. 
In this chapter, Ley describes how her life turned out the way it is, and how much messiness the process entailed:
A necessary chapter to reiterate the main idea, this time in relation to your family.
Namely, feeling as if you are not the perfect mother is natural; so natural, in fact, that every mother feels it.
However, if that’s the case, doesn’t this mean that it’s also something which is not correct?
After all, most of us have turned out fine.
It’s in your blood to be a good mother.
Don’t listen to the little voice in the head.
It is the voice of your Neanderthal ancestress who lived in a very different time and age.
Contentment, according to the 
, is a state of happiness and satisfaction.
It’s something you crave for, but also something you must make room for in your life.
The best way to do this is to simplify matters and start making things happen.
That’s the very essence of what life is all about.
“Comparison,” writes Ley, “is the thief of joy.”
So, don’t allow yourself to mar your contentment by way of comparison with some people who, on the face of it, look happier than you.
Believe us, they too have serious, serious problems.
You should love yourself and your life much more than that.
Key Lessons from “Grace, Not Perfection”
1.      Good Is Better Than Perfect
2.      Savor the Messiness and the Chaos
3.      Choose the Life You Want to Live – and Not Job You Want to Work
Good Is Better Than Perfect
To paraphrase Emily Ley, perfectionism is the true killer of joy.
“True joy isn’t found in having it all together,” she writes. “The good life is rich, slow, real, and flawed.”
In other words, if you want to live a perfect life – paradoxically – accept its imperfectness.
Don’t sacrifice the good to chase the perfect.
The former is 
 better.
Savor the Messiness and the Chaos
No matter how much all of those photographs on Facebook and Instagram try to convince you in the opposite, unfiltered, even the lives of the happiest among us are as messy and as chaotic as you’d expect them to be.
The difference between them and you?
They’ve decided to embrace the messiness and savor the circus.
Because they know that, at the end of it, these will be some of their happiest days.
Choose the Life You Want to Live – and Not Job You Want to Work
If you are younger and still undecided over your career, then this is the perfect moment to stop thinking of a career.
Not because you shouldn’t have one – everybody needs money, after all; but because your job is merely a tiny part of your life.
So, instead of thinking about it, it’s much better to think about the big picture.
Define the life you want to live – and then go for it!

Our Critical Review
The simple, guiding idea of 
is revealed already in the title of the book. 
If you are a woman and you think that you can achieve that without a guiding light, then you don’t need this or any other book. In fact, if that’s the case – congratulations, you’ve found the perfect formula for bliss and happiness! 
should be the one writing books for the rest of us.
However, if you want some help decluttering your day-to-day schedule and your ever-exhausted mind – and you are a Christian or have no problems accepting a bit (and maybe, a bit too much) of the Christian God in your heart – then do consider letting Emily Ley in your life. 
It’s not that her ideas are new or revolutionary; but, let’s face it, it’s always easier when you have someone telling you what to do and when to do it.
Beautifully designed and straight-to-the-point, 
 is a beautiful life-changing – and life-saving – gift.
But before deciding to give it to somebody else – give it to yourself first."

There’s a common saying, that the state of your bed is the state of your head
 Every step we take reflects who we are. If I’m calm, the people I talk to will probably reply in a similar manner. This is due to the fact that our surroundings reflect our personality.
If we’re not fond of cleanliness, our room might be messy. Similarly, we tend to wait for instructions in every part of our lives.
Maybe it’s because great theories lead our practical lives. And who wouldn’t want to live a perfect life?
Defining ourselves is in our very nature: my name is; I live here; I have green eyes; I’m short; I’m a dreamy person, or maybe down-to-earth. This leads us to an author named Akash Karia.
About Akash Karia
 is an award-winning speaker and peak performance coach. He currently lives in Tanzania, where he works as the Chief Commercial Officer of a multi-million dollar company.
“Habits for Life PDF Summary”
He regularly conducts keynotes, workshops, and seminars. His fans say he’s a phenomenal coach, and the knowledge gained from him is priceless.
I believe Karia is one of the few authors who try to highlight that we ourselves are not the problem. The great problem consists in our surroundings, generated by the lack of good instructions.
Akash Karia hints at our individual footprints; our steps create paths. That’s why his book is entitled

is a guidebook for creating order in our chaotic world, a world in which global communications can damage our self-images.
Karia’s main concept relies on two different branches: the small habit and the keystone habit.
Small habits are those which are so small that very little willpower is required to carry them out. Keystone habits, on the other hand, are the habits that set off a chain reaction of new and improved behaviors in other unrelated areas. These two habits create an equation like this:
Small Habits + Keystone Habits = Big Results.
Akash Karia gives tips for habits: read for 10 minutes; do two push-ups; drink a small glass of water with lunch; stretch for one minute; write 25 words in your journal; sit down at a piano; do one yoga pose; floss one tooth; laugh out loud once. These actions force you to do something and to do something regularly.
If you plan, you can then carry it out. 
, you should reward yourself. If you lose, you should learn from it. A small habit could be putting on your running shoes. You’ve already won, whether you actually go for a run or not.
If you apply this small habit regularly, it’s more likely to start a chain of habits – a keystone habit.
There’s a vital concept of planning, called the “if-then goals”. It increases the chances of success. The main idea is to focus on the positive and take some time to plan ahead.
It’s also about “mental contrasting”. You have to be optimistic because

 claims Akash Karia.
But any autopilot still needs someone to keep an eye on it, like a GPS relying on satellites. Our personal GPS could be a close friend. According to Karia, it’s important to have the added perspective of someone who can motivate you, and who understands the importance of consistency.
That’s why it’s best to choose someone whose characteristics you wish to emulate. The friend who lives off pizza and fried chicken probably won’t be the one encouraging you to stick with your plate of steamed vegetables.
If you can’t find a friend to motivate you, turn to your second best friend – the Internet. Writing down your goals and achievements is a successful strategy: blog it, Tweet it, put it on Facebook. You’ll have to adapt to your circumstances.
You can achieve your goals by reading Karia’s book step-by-step. That’s right!

In the 1950s, a plastic surgeon named Maxwell Maltz began noticing that after operations, it took about 21 days for his patients to mentally adjust to their new images…
According to research, a new behavior can take anywhere from 18 to 254 days to become a habit… The average timeframe for habit formation, according to the study by Dr. Phillippa Lally, is 66.

In creating an everyday routine, our duty is to increase our motivation and focus on the ‘big picture’.
