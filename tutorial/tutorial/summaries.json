Moreover, why do some of the experiences we remember are so meaningful to us? How is it possible that a single, somewhat unimportant event\u2014such as noticing someone you love in a crowd two hours after getting the boot at work\u2014can turn an unbearable day into one of the most outstanding days of our life?\nThese are all questions the Heath brothers try to answer in their newest book, \n. Contrary to popular belief, they don\u2019t think that most of the defining moments of our lives just happen to us as in the example above.\nTrue, many of them are \u201cproduct of fate or luck or maybe a higher power\u2019s interventions,\u201d but the majority are controllable and \u201cno less special for having been planned.\u201d\n\u201cDefining moments shape our lives,\u201d the Heath brothers write, \u201cbut we don\u2019t have to wait for them to happen. We can be the authors of them. What if a teacher could design a lesson that students were still reflecting on years later? What if a manager knew exactly how to turn an employee\u2019s moment of failure into a moment of growth? What if you had a better sense of how to create lasting memories for your kids?\u201d\ntries to make this possible. Its objectives are twofold:\u00a0\n\u2022 It examines defining moments and \u201cidentifies the traits they have in common,\u201d trying to answer the question \u201cwhat, specifically, makes a particular experience memorable and meaningful?\u201d; and\n\u2022 It shows how \n can create defining moments by making use of these traits so that you can make memories, enrich your life, connect with others or improve the experience of customers, employees or even patients.\nSo much for the intro. Now, onto our summary!\nThe Peak-End Rule of Defining Moments\nLet\u2019s start our discussion of memorable and defining moments in a rather unconventional manner: with a psychological experiment that asked participants to undergo three painful trials.\nIn the first, the somewhat sadistic researchers submerged their participants\u2019 hands for 1 minute in buckets filled with frigid, 57-degree (13 Celsius) water. The second trial was similar\u2014but with a catch: after having their hands submerged for 60 seconds in the 57-degree water, the participants had to keep them for 30 seconds more; the only difference was that during these thirty seconds the water warmed up to 59 degrees (15 Celsius).\u00a0\nNow, for their third painful experience, the participants were given a choice: Would you rather repeat the first trial or the second?\nTo the reader of this summary, this might seem like an easy question. After all, both trials featured 1 minute of identical pain, and the second trial \nanother half a minute of \nSo, write the Heaths, \u201cthis is kind of like asking: would you rather be slapped in the face for 60 seconds or 90?\u201d\nEven so, two-thirds of the participants chose the longer trial.\nHow so?\nWell, for one, because when we assess an experience, we tend to forget its length, something psychologists refer to as \u201cthe duration neglect.\u201d Bear in mind that though the researchers in our experiment above measured the time carefully, the participants were never told how much time had elapsed at no point during the experiment.\u00a0\nThe second reason, however, is much more interesting: almost without an expectation, we rate our experiences based on two key moments: 1) the best or worst moment, known as the \u201cpeak\u201d; and 2) the ending.\u00a0\nPsychologists call this the \u201cpeak-end rule,\u201d and it is the reason why you think that \nis a great movie and Roger Ebert doesn\u2019t share this opinion with you. The twist at the end of a movie, if well-written and structurally sound, makes you forget about all the plot holes or anything else you might have hated about the movie. Instead, it makes you think about the peak-moment and packs it up the whole experience in a defining moment.\nLet\u2019s be honest for a second here: not much of the plot of \nyou can \n recreate. And still, you rate that movie pretty highly.\u00a0\nThe reason for that is this peak-end rule of how we remember things: instead of playing out like an opera filled with constantly changing minute-by-minute sensations, our experiences are usually assessed in our brains via their flagship moments: the peaks, the pits, and the transitions.\nAnd we can use that to our benefit.\nThinking in Moments\nYou see, as the Heath brothers write, \u201cevery culture has its prescribed set of big moments: birthdays and weddings and graduations, of course, but also holiday celebrations and funeral rites and political traditions.\u201d Though they might seem \u201cnatural\u201d to you, most of them are actually invented, \u201cdreamed up by anonymous authors who wanted to give shape to time.\u201d\nThis is what the Heaths mean by \u201cthinking in moments,\u201d process they define poetically as \u201crecognizing where the prose of life needs punctuation.\u201d\nIn their opinion\u2014and according to their research\u2014there are three situations that deserve such punctuation: transitions, milestones, and pits.\n\u2022 \n. Transitions seem so natural\nthat they are almost always marked with some sort of \u201ccoming of age\u201d rituals (both across cultures and across time). These \u201ccoming of age\u201d rituals\u2014be they bar mitzvahs or weddings\u2014are sort of boundary markers, in that they try to pin down the gradual evolution of a human being into a few defining and memorable moments. Promotions, the first day of school and the end of projects are all transitional moments that should be marked: create defining moments for your kids, your loved ones and your employees by shaping a \u201ccoming of age\u201d ritual around them.\n\u2022 \n. Birthdays are the most obvious milestones, and the most obvious milestone-birthdays (believe it or not, this holds true for many cultures) are the 18\n, the 21\n, the 30\n, 40\n, 50\n, 60\n and the 100\n. Retirement and unheralded achievements (such as, say, a salesman\u2019s 10 millionth dollar of revenue or the tenth promotion of the direct reports of a talented manager) are also milestones that should be marked.\u00a0\n\u2022 \nPits\nare the opposite of peaks, i.e., negative defining moments, moments of hardship or pain or anxiety. It\u2019s difficult to deal with negative feedback and almost impossible to overcome the loss of a loved one. Shouldn\u2019t organizations be ready with a plan for these moments?\n\u201cTransitions should be marked, milestones commemorated, and pits filled,\u201d write the Heaths. \u201cThat\u2019s the essence of thinking in moments.\u201d\nHowever, to actually make these moments defining\u2014i.e., memorable and meaningful\u2014you need to know what memorable and meaningful moments are made of. Apparently, we\u2019re talking about no more than four elements: the more of them you include in a certain experience, the more guaranteed you are to turn it into a defining moment.\nWithout further ado, here are the four elements.\nTrait #1: Elevation\n\u201cDefining moments rise above the everyday,\u201d write the Heaths. \u201cThey provoke not just transient happiness, like laughing at a friend\u2019s joke, but memorable delight.\u201d\nTo construct elevated moments, we must do three things: boost sensory pleasures, raise the stakes, and break the script.\n is all about \u201cturning up the volume on reality. Things look better or taste better or sound better or feel better than they usually do.\u201d This is why weddings have flowers and food and music and dancing, and why students remember extracurricular activities much more than they do lessons\u2014even though they spend disproportionately more time in the classroom.\nmeans \u201cto add an element of productive pressure: a competition, a game, a performance, a deadline, a public commitment.\u201d\u00a0\nFinally, \n means to add an element of surprise: it\u2019s not only that surprises warp our perceptions of time (the less expected the information to your brain the longer the experiences last\u2014quite literally), but they also keep the elevation afloat.\u00a0\nThink about it this way: if you, as a CEO, decided to give away presents to your employees every Friday, you would have added only a few defining moments to their lives because, after the second or third repetition, they\u2019ll start expecting it (it will become a part of the script). It will no longer be memorable\u2014on the contrary, it will be a disappointing experience if it stops.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cMoments of elevation transcend the normal course of events; they are literally extraordinary,\u201d conclude the Heaths. That\u2019s why you have a bunch of them in your treasure chest in the form of love letters, ticket stubs, a well-worn T-shirt, or haphazardly colored cards from your kids that make you smile with delight.\nTrait #2: Insight\n\u201cDefining moments rewire our understanding of ourselves or the world,\u201d write the Heaths. \u201cIn a few seconds or minutes, we realize something that might influence our lives for decades.\u201d For example, you will never forget the day you first thought things such as \u201cthis is the person I\u2019m going to marry\u201d or \u201cnow is the time to start a business.\u201d\nModern writers (such as Proust or Joyce) deem these events \u201cepiphanies,\u201d and though it is very difficult to schedule them, it is not impossible. Two things help: making yourself (or others) trip over the truth or stretch for insight.\nis a three-part recipe which turns explanations into experiences, and experiences into epiphanies. It starts with \u201ca clear insight\u201d that is then \u201ccompressed in time\u201d so that it can finally be \u201cdiscovered by the audience itself.\u201d\u00a0\nFor example, in one \u201cunforgettably disgusting story,\u201d the Heaths explain how members of the WaterAid convinced some Bangladeshi villagers to use their new toilets (actually, latrines) instead of using the village\u2019s outdoor spaces for defecation.\u00a0\nThey made the problem clear and compressed it in time by producing a map of the village and making every villager sprinkle a little yellow chalk on every place where someone had defecated during the last year.\u00a0\nThe \u201ctrip-over-the-truth\u201d moment came when the CLTS (Community-Led Total Sanitation) facilitator asked the members of his audience to drink a glass of water, after swirling in it a hair from his head previously dipped in excrement.\nEveryone refused, of course, but after being pointed out that flies pick up more excrement than a human hair, the community suddenly realized that for years, they have been eating each other\u2019s excrement. And that was the epiphany, the \u201cignition moment\u201d for change.\nThere\u2019s another way to induce epiphanies: it\u2019s called \n. In essence, this encompasses placing yourself in new situations that expose you to the risk of failure. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019ll succeed or not\u2014the insight is guaranteed either way. \u201cThe promise of stretching is not success,\u201d write the Heaths, \u201cit\u2019s learning.\u201d\nBy the way, you have numerous insight-moments in your treasure chest: quotes or articles that moved you, books that changed your view of the world, diaries that captured your thoughts, etc. etc.\u00a0\nTrait #3: Pride\nDefining moments capture us at our best\u2014moments of achievement, moments of courage, moments of pride.\u00a0\nThere are three practical principles to create more moments such as this: 1) Recognize others; 2) Multiply meaningful milestones; 3) Practice courage. As the Heaths say, \u201cthe first principle creates defining moments for others; the latter two allow us to create defining moments for ourselves.\u201d\nis self-explanatory, and yet, we dramatically underinvest in recognition. For example, even though 4 out of 5 supervisors say they frequently express appreciation for their workers, just 1 of 5 employees agrees.\nIt\u2019s important to note that effective recognition is personal, not programmatic: \u201cEmployee of the Month\u201d awards, for example, are part of the script that needs to be broken. \u201cTailored rewards\u201d make all the difference\u2014as anyone who has ever gotten the birthday gift they wanted knows full well.\n\u201cRecognition is characterized by a disjunction,\u201d say the Heaths. \u201cA small investment of effort yields a huge reward for the recipient.\u201d For example, the life of a middle-school student can be irretrievably changed by a caring music teacher who doesn\u2019t shy away from telling her that her voice is beautiful. (True story, by the way, one of the many that appear on the pages of \n).\nTurning to yourself, \nis one of the best strategies to create more defining moments of pride in your life. Reframing the marathon that is your life in a lane featuring many \u201cfinish lines\u201d is what makes life worthwhile. Imagine if your life consisted of Mondays only; now, imagine if it features three-day workweeks. Strive for the latter!\nFinally, \nalso results in memorable and meaningful moments of pride. Moreover, courage is contagious: your defining moment of courage can be a defining moment for someone else as well.\nThe fact that moments of pride are defining moments of life can be proven by the contents of your treasure chest: ribbons, report cards, notes of recognition, certificates, thank-yous, awards\u2026 Why haven\u2019t you thrown them out? \u201cIt just hurts, irrationally, to throw away a trophy,\u201d write the Heaths.\nTrait #4: Connection\n\u201cDefining moments are social: weddings, graduations, baptisms, vacations, work triumphs, bar and bat mitzvahs, speeches, sporting events. These moments are strengthened because we share them with others\u2026 Moments of connection bond us with others. We feel warmth, unity, empathy, validation,\u201d write the Heaths.\nTo spark moments of connection for groups, one must \n. That can be accomplished by three strategies: (1) creating a synchronized moment; (2) inviting shared struggle; and (3) connecting to meaning. Think of church congregations or just-cause protests as two good examples. Remember \n? Even we, as viewers, feel the need to join in.\n\u201cGroups bond when they struggle together,\u201d write the Heaths. \u201cPeople will welcome a struggle when it\u2019s their choice to participate, when they\u2019re given autonomy to work, and when the mission is meaningful.\u201d Think of all the AA meetings: sharing experiences of pain and sadness is one of the best \u201csocial technologies to bind in-groups together.\u201d\nConnection is also about \n. And according to a psychologist named Harry Reis, what deepens individual relationships is \u201cresponsiveness.\u201d Responsiveness, in turn, consists of three things: mutual understanding, validation, and caring.\nCheck your treasure chest. All those wedding photos, vacation photos, family photos, \u201cChristmas photos of hideous sweaters,\u201d photos, photos, photos\u2026 are probably the first thing you\u2019d grab if your house caught on fire, right?\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Power of Moments\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Defining Moments (and the Peak-End Rule)\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Secret of Thinking in Moments\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Four Elements Defining Moments Are Made Of\nDefining Moments (and the Peak-End Rule)\nEven though it might seem a bit counter-intuitive, most people tend to assess their experiences based on two key moments: 1) the best or the worst moment (the peak), and 2) the ending of the experience. That\u2019s why, even if a film is great for two hours, you\u2019ll give it a 3-star rating if it doesn\u2019t nail its ending.\u00a0\nIn other words, as memorable and meaningful as they are (by definition), the defining moments of your life can be hacked: you just need to focus on their peak and their ending.\nThe Secret of Thinking in Moments\nThere are numerous defining moments in an average human\u2019s life, but according to the Heath brothers, they can all be categorized into three classes:\u00a0\n\u2022 \n: coming-of-age moments, such as the first day of school or a promotion\n\u2022 \n: birthdays or retirements\n\u2022 \n: negative defining moments, such as the loss of a loved one\nIf you want to make one\u2019s experience better, focus on these three types of moments\u2014\u201ctransitions should be marked, milestones commemorated, and pits filled\u201d\u2014and you will.\nThe Four Elements Defining Moments Are Made Of\nAll defining moments consist of one or more of these four elements:\n\u2022 \n: they rise above the everyday\n\u2022 \n: they rewrite our understanding of the world\n\u2022 \n: they capture us at our best\n\u2022 \n: they are social\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Power of Moments Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\n\u201cThe most interesting, immediately actionable book I\u2019ve read in quite a while,\u201d wrote \n in a review of \n. \u201cI walked away with new ideas for motivating employees, delighting customers, engaging students, and even planning family vacations. If life is a series of moments, the Heath brothers have transformed how I plan to spend mine.\u201dUndoubtedly, they can do the same for you as well. \u201cFlat out amazing\u201d (according to \n), \n\u201coffers something for everyone\u2014medical practitioners rethinking the patient experience, corporate leaders re-imagining staff engagement, small businesses looking to differentiate themselves, teachers crafting more memorable lessons\u2026 All those desperate for blueprints for creating the extraordinary should read this book.\u201d (\n)\n\n"},

And Why?\n\u201cIn today\u2019s wikinomics world, yesterday\u2019s leadership traits can be liability,\u201d writes \n coauthor Don Tapscott. \u201c\nshows leaders how to prepare their collaborative minds.\u201d\nSo, if you are a leader who wants to prepare for the mass collaboration age we\u2019re going through, then don\u2019t hesitate to consult this book. But, be warned: it was published a decade ago, and many of the things Gobillot suggested you should be doing before anybody else \u2013 you\u2019re \ndoing.\nAbout Emmanuel Gobillot\n is a leadership guru and a bestselling author.\nDescribed as \u201cthe first leadership guru for the digital generation\u201d and even \u201cthe freshest voice in leadership today,\u201d Emmanuel Gobillot has over two decades of experience in helping organizations globally rethink the way they build and run themselves.\u00a0\nHe has authored five bestselling leadership and management titles, including \n and \n, all driven by his trademarked mantra: \u201cThere must be a better way and together we can find it!\u201d\nFind out more at \n\u00a0\n\u201cLeadershift PDF Summary\u201d\n, \nby Emmanuel Gobillot \u2013 not to be confused with the same-titled book by \n \u2013 tries to see how the age of mass collaboration and horizontal hierarchical structures affects the position of the leader, until recently (and all the way from the Stone Age) a clearly defined title role one could only get based on his \u201cexperience, expertise and control.\u201d\nHowever, Gobillot claims, this is an outdated model of leadership, and we can only guess the one that is soon to be introduced via the \u201cmass collaboration\u201d paradigm shift. Since nothing of that sort has ever happened before, he writes, \u201cthere are few, if any, clues from the past to inform the way we can be successful in the future, we are unlikely to get insights into becoming leaders in the next generation by looking back at our experiences or our elders.\u201d\nSo, suitably, Gobillot looks forward: he analyzes which factors have contributed to the \u201cleadershift\u201d of the title and then he suggests what kind of adjustments leaders are supposed to make to keep up with time. In essence, this makes \na book of four trends and four shifts \u2013 we summarize them all below!\nThe Day of Reckoning: We Need a New Type of Leader\n opens with a tellingly beautiful quote by \n author Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry \u2013 \u201cAs for the future, your task is not to foresee it, but to enable it\u201d \u2013 which Gobillot comments upon soon after, thus:\nIn other words, according to Gobillot, the future has arrived and in a form not really predicted by capitalism: people are mass collaborating on projects in a way that has allowed practically anonymous contributors to create the most comprehensive (and perhaps the very best) encyclopedia in history (\n) without nothing but a desire and a self-perfecting list of rules created on the go by the very same community.\nThe financial turbulences of 2008, Gobillot says, are practically minor compared to this type of \u201cpervasive\u2026 clear-air turbulence.\u201d The former he deems short-term (even though writing in the midst of the crisis), but the latter he rightly sees as affecting the leadership role in the long run \u2013 if not irreversibly.\n\u201cWhilst the first type of turbulence questions our \n as leaders,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe second kind questions the very \n of leadership.\u201d\nThe Four Trends That Question the Essence of Leadership\nAs each day passes, \u201cthe way leaders create value becomes less effective.\u201d Put in simpler terms, the very levers they rely on \u2013 experience, knowledge, effort, and power \u2013 \u201care being eroded by four major trends.\u201d\nGobillot names these trends the Demographic, the Expertise, the Attention, and the Democratic trend \u2013 and he explains why they spell (quite literally, since the four trends actually form the acronym DEAD), the death of leadership as we know it.\nThe first trend eroding the levers of traditional leadership is the demographic trend since it quite forcefully makes your experience (one of the tenets of leadership) irrelevant and obsolete.\n\u201cIn a nutshell, the demographic trend is we now find ourselves with multiple generations with multiple socio-cultural backgrounds working alongside each other,\u201d writes Gobillot. \u201cEach brings with it its own hopes, fears, expectations, and experiences that other generations do not understand and to which they cannot relate.\u201d\nHow does this affect your leadership position?\nWell, put simply, no matter what kind of experience you have, you\u2019ll be leading a group of people who will most definitely have a different background (and, thus, experiences) than you. Gone are the days of \n, as are the days of the overtly racist and/or covertly sexist work environment.\nNowadays, you\u2019ll have to lead, at the same time, a 52-year-old blue-collar American manager, a 37-year-old female Mexican designer with expertise in at least one different area, and a 23-year-old African-American intern with a dream.\nYour experience (no matter how wide-ranging) would never help you empathize with all of your workers \u2013 if only a third. And when that happens, when your experience bears no resemblance to the experience of people who you are called to lead \u2013 or in no way offers you any insight into what might make you successful \u2013 you risk becoming absolutely irrelevant.\nThink of Wikipedia once again.\nThough very few of the people who contribute to it are consensually deemed experts in their fields, numerous foremost experts in \n fields start their research on Wikipedia where they can find info on anything from Thomas Mann\u2019s bibliography to all the previous Academy Award nominees for a foreign movie to current advancements in quantum physics.\nThat\u2019s the power of Web 2.0, the participative/social web which, according to Wikipedia of course, \u201crefers to websites that emphasize user-generated content, ease of use, participatory culture and interoperability (i.e., compatible with other products, systems, and devices) for end-users.\u201d\nUntil very recently, many organizations existed because this was impossible and because they helped significantly in reducing the contractual costs of managing multiple relationships. However, now that technology has allowed \u201cfor networks to create value in a much more inclusive, and therefore powerful way than organizations can,\u201d they are not as necessary.\nIn other words, if an encyclopedia can be written without leaders and if billions of DIY tutorials and MOOC courses are available for free online, then is there really a need for an expert leader in any field? Why shouldn\u2019t they be replaced by software as well?\nThe third trend that makes traditional leadership outmoded is the attention trend: we are just incapable of paying attention to everything that happens around us. Consequently, it is irrelevant how much you try as a leader: a lot of your work will definitely go unnoticed.\nHere are just a few mind-boggling stats Gobillot provides that make his case even clearer:\n\u2022 The average e-mail user received 65,000 messages during 2009 alone (it\u2019s probably even more today).\n\u2022 More than 300,000 books are published every year.\n\u2022 The average weekday edition of \n contains more information than someone would have come across in his or her lifetime in 17th-century England.\n\u2022 Forty exabytes (4 \u00d7 10\n) of unique information is produced in a year \u2013 more than was produced in the previous 5,000 years taken together. \n\u2022 There are around 2 billion web pages and the Internet is 500 larger than the 91 million daily Google searches can ever show.\n\u2022 A typical supermarket stocks around 40,000 items.\n\u201cSo, where do you focus?\u201d asks Gobillot. \u201cWhere do you go for answers?\u201d\nBombarded by messages and information, modern human beings have no choice but to be selective: selectiveness is \u201cour way of cutting through the information clutter and the demands on our attention.\u201d\nOrganizations were used to an essential part of the network of attention, but \u201ca collection of social and informational networks is coming to replace them as a source of coherence and cohesion for people.\u201d\nTo Gobillot, the reason is clear: \u201cthey replicate more closely the way we seek engagement than organizations have been able to achieve through their narrow focus on roles, rules, and economic incentives, rather than on individuals and their sense of moral and social obligations.\u201d\nPut simply, the attention trend means that everyone is living in a filter bubble now to make sense of the world and leaders are being \n.\u00a0\n\u201cIn the democratic world,\u201d writes Gobillot, \u201cleaders are no longer an accident of birth. We can choose whom to follow. We even get to vote whenever we want. In this world, the leader never gets to call the election.\u201d\nConsequently, leaders are devoid of positional power and unable to engage people. Free agencies and freelancers make it all but impossible for them to create followers: the very idea of being \u201can employee\u201d has nothing to do with what that word meant to our parents and our parents\u2019 parents.\nYou can\u2019t lead someone who can leave after a year, can you? And they are not fully engaged with any organization, are they?\nThe Four Shifts: Meeting Change Head-On\nSince the four trends explicated above, taken together, spell the death of leadership as we know it, if you want to remain relevant as a leader today, you need to wiggle your way through the changes by becoming a new type of a leader.\u00a0\nEven though, at first glance, the trends above seem damning to the very need of leaders in the modern world, in reality, it is not so: though members of a community don\u2019t necessarily act as \n, they do need to feel as if they belong to the community for the community to thrive. And, as all human beings do, they fear being expelled.\nModern leaders should work to allay these fears and fortify the feeling of belonging, by securing engagement, ensuring alignment, creating accountability and obtaining commitment. These, according to Gobillot, are the four shifts that would transform traditional leadership into modern leadershift, an alternative method to govern mass collaboration communities.\nThe arch-nemesis of connection is complexity: when one feels unable to understand the instructions for engagement or the interface that stands between them and the community, they simply give up trying to become a member without even trying.\nThat\u2019s why it should be the first job of a leader to make the transition between being outside of a community and inside it as smooth as possible. Leaders should work hard to eliminate complexity, by simplifying everything \u2013 \u201cprocesses, products, reporting lines and channels\u201d \u2013 even if that means eliminating legacy processes and systems.\u00a0\nIn addition to this, they should always provide coherence, because a community that grants independence to its members would soon stop being a community. \u201cCoherence is the ability to highlight the interdependence of a system,\u201d i.e., the ability to demonstrate to every member of a team that though being a simple clog, he/she is an essential part of the whole.\nBy definition, leaders must answer two critical questions: 1) How do I ensure that community members understand their involvement in the social process (i.e., how do they best contribute)? And 2) How do I make sure that people stay aligned behind the mission?\nIn the past, both of these questions were answered with a plan. But plans are now just vestiges of some bygone times since they have in their very nature engraved the idea of a top-to-down hierarchy.\u00a0\nThe modern age is an age of narratives: people don\u2019t want to hear orders and instructions, but they want to be part of a story that unites them. \u201cThe role of the leader,\u201d writes Gobillot, \u201cis to facilitate the narrative \u2013 helping participants and the community define who they are, what they aspire to and how they hope to get there.\u201d\nIf you are a leader, always remember that the best narratives are the ones that are able of providing an answer to three all-important questions: \u201cWho are we?\u201d \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d and \u201cWhy are we going there?\u201d\nIf you are working in the IT-sector, you already know what Gobillot means by this third shift (and can probably discern his farsightedness).\nNamely, once again, the idea of a \u201crole\u201d is a remnant of the time when vertical hierarchy was believed to be the only way to structure the relationship in an organization. Each member, thus, becomes a function of a superstructure, and it is not through his individuality and uniqueness that he/she is asked to contribute, but through his ability and skillset to conform to his function/role.\nThat, however, came with a burden: people were asked to leave their social roles outside the door of their companies.\nIt is, fortunately, quite different nowadays: because of the advancements in technology, social roles do not need to interfere with organizational roles. You can be whoever you like to be \u2013 not just outside of work, but inside as well (\n).\u00a0\nThough roles are not easily disposable even in modern work environments, they are now much more fluid and flexible, and the best organizations can easily think of their workers (regardless of their job titles) in terms of tasks. Tasks are listed and are up for grabs \u2013 giving leaders the opportunity to easily detect hard workers from slackers and hold the latter accountable, even if they work from home.\nThey used to teach leaders that money is the ultimate motivator. However, as numerous studies have demonstrated (\n), after a certain limit (and especially in certain professions) money tends to \n.\nFortunately, during the past few decades, \n. So, leaders need to change if they want to achieve commitment from their workers. Stats have shown that if the mission of your company doesn\u2019t align with your employees\u2019 interests, after one or two pay rises, you can do absolutely nothing to motivate them unless you change your company\u2019s course.\nLove works much better than money: it motivates beyond every point and limit. People would do absolutely everything for an organization and a leader they love.\nTo become one of the latter, start first by \n your job as well: if you don\u2019t love it, say goodbye to the possibility of socially incentivizing your employees. Then, start concentrating on the community rather than concentrating on your individual workers.\n\u201cFor leaders,\u201d writes Gobillot, \u201cthis may be somewhat counter-intuitive as we have been told as leaders that we need to understand what motivates an individual and focus our efforts on maximizing that motivation. But what matters to the functioning of our communities is not what motivates individuals but rather that they direct that motivation to making the community stronger.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cLeadershift\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Traditional Leadership Is an Outdated Model\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Four Trends That Have Eroded the Tenets of Traditional Leadership into Obsolesce \n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A Redefined Role: The Four Shifts in Leadership\nTraditional Leadership Is an Outdated Model\nTraditional leadership was based on several unquestionable tenets: expertise, experience, control, domineering presence, authority. None of them matter anymore, says Gobillot \u2013 at least not in a world of mass collaboration that has produced Wikipedia.\nThe Four Trends That Have Eroded the Tenets of Traditional Leadership into Obsolesce\u00a0\nFour major societal trends have forever transformed the role of leadership in the 21\n century and beyond:\n\u2022 \n means that multiple generations from different races, genders, and ethnic backgrounds now work alongside each other \u2013 each with demands and experiences that others cannot comprehend. Consequently, your experience as a leader is not enough.\n\u2022 \n means that \u201cexpertise is now to be found as much outside as inside the organization\u201d: the knowledge of the people who wrote \n is irrelevant because a bunch of much less knowledgeable people was able to create \n. \n\u2022 \n means that \u201corganizations have to fight harder than ever to capture the attention of employees and customers as information and interaction sources lay claim to limited time.\u201d Think smartphones, emails, video games, TV channels, Netflix, HBO and all the other distractions out there.\n\u2022 \nmeans that \u201cthe likelihood of leaders having direct control (rather than dotted lines or no lines at all) over their resources is remote.\u201d Think freelancers and agencies.\nA Redefined Role: The Four Shifts in Leadership\nTo counter the four trends, leaders need to change significantly, making four all-important shifts from the traditional leadership model. Where they once relied on clarity, plans, roles, and money to create a working community, they now need to rely on:\n\u2022 \n the more complex the instructions are, the less \n a member of the community is. Consequently, everything needs to be simplified and made coherent, combining both purpose and straightforwardness of use.\n\u2022 \n: plans are a list of orders, i.e., remnant of top-to-down hierarchical structure. To \n the members of your community with a single mission, you need to ensure that they are all part of the organization\u2019s arching story.\n\u2022 \n: in an ever-changing environment, roles that define \n must make way for tasks \u2013 a member of a community is not merely a function of an organization, but someone who can choose their own destiny by combining several different tasks pertaining to their interest and skillset\n\u2022 \n: Money motivates only to a certain point. Love motivates beyond it. Make your employees love their job, rather than trying to buy their \n: it doesn\u2019t work anymore.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cLeadershift Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nIt is fascinating to think how redundant seems \nmerely a decade after being published.\u00a0\nTen years ago, it may have been all but revolutionary, but nowadays, what Gobillot had so farsightedly observed years before other leaders, is part of the common knowledge.\nIn other words, many of the things Gobillot suggests you should do as a leader, you\u2019re \n doing \u2013 merely via the force of necessity.\u00a0\nBut don\u2019t take away nothing from him: as \n proves, he \n that the role of the leader will be redefined completely at a time when very few people even bothered questioning the concept of traditional leadership.\nHats off to Gobillot for that!"},

Dr. Eberhardt\u2019s work offers a touchstone for educators, leaders, lawmakers, and all those who want a society that serves everyone equally.\u201d\nAbout Jennifer L. Eberhardt\n is an American social psychologist and professor of psychology at Stanford University.\nA winner of the MacArthur Fellowship in 2014, Eberhardt is also a co-director of SPARQ (Social Psychological Answers to Real-World Questions) and a member of the National Academy of Sciences ever since 2016.\nDubbed one of Foreign Policy\u2019s 100 Leading Global Thinkers, Eberhardt is the author of numerous studies on racial discrimination and implicit bias, but \nis her first book.\n\u201cBiased PDF Summary\u201d\nWhether you want to admit to yourself or not, you are irrefutably, at least to some extent, a racist\u2014though that\u2019s not the right term.\nYou see, we are born with something modern social psychologists refer to as \u201cimplicit bias,\u201d that is to say, an innate predilection for people who look like us coupled with an immediate suspicion against those who are different.\nJennifer L. Eberhardt\u2019s magisterial study, \n, is an examination of precisely this: implicit bias\u2014what it is, where it comes from, how it affects us, and how we can address it.\u00a0\nDescribing the phenomenon as \u201ca kind of distorting lens that\u2019s a product of both the architecture of our brain and the disparities in our society,\u201d Eberhardt explains right away that it can be associated with everything, i.e., we can hold biases based on all sorts of characteristics: skin color, age, weight, ethnic origin, accent, disability, height, gender.\nHowever, \nis primarily about race, and primarily about the relationship between blacks and whites, not only because \u201cthe racial dynamics between blacks and whites are dramatic, consequential, and enduring,\u201d but also because these two groups \u201chave been studied the most by researchers investigating bias.\u201d\n\u201cWe all have ideas about race, even the most open-minded among us,\u201d writes Eberhardt in a further delineation of the subject-matter of her book\n\u201cThose ideas have the power to bias our perception, our attention, our memory, and our actions\u2014all despite our conscious awareness or deliberate intentions. Our ideas about race are shaped by the stereotypes to which we are exposed on a daily basis. And one of the strongest stereotypes in American society associates blacks with criminality.\u201d\nBut is this not, once again, the \n at play? Namely, how could there be such a thing as a prevailing stereotype if it is not based on something factual? But if it is factual, then why is it a stereotype as well? Also, if there\u2019s no truth in associating blacks with criminality, then why are so many African-Americans in prison? Can we do something about it?\nThese are all questions that \ntries to answer. Chapter by chapter, we\u2019ll try to sum up Eberhardt\u2019s answers and analyses below.\nPart I: What Meets the Eye\nBack in 2000, a now \n revealed something quite remarkable: London cab drivers had enlarged posterior hippocampal regions (the part of the brain that plays a critical role in spatial memory and navigation) in comparison with a control group of people who didn\u2019t drive cabs for a living.\u00a0\nIn fact, the connection was even more blatant: the longer the drivers had been on the job and the more experience they had, the larger their posterior hippocampus.\nThis inspired Jennifer L. Eberhardt to ask herself a somewhat frightening question: \u201cBecause our experiences in the world are reflected in our brains, might our expertise in recognizing faces of our own race\u2014and failing to recognize those of others\u2014display its own neurobiological signature as well?\u201d\nTo answer this question, Eberhardt joined a team of Stanford scientists who studied something known as the fusiform face area (FFA). Buried deep near the base of the brain, the FFA helps us distinguish the familiar from the unfamiliar, friend from foe. It is widely thought to be \u201cboth primitive and fundamental to our survival as a species. Affiliation is a basic human need. Without the ability to track the identity of those around us, we are left alone, vulnerable, and exposed.\u201d\nWhat did the study find out?\n\u201cBy tracking the activation of the FFA over multiple displays of strangers\u2019 faces,\u201d writes Eberhardt, \u201cwe found that the FFA was responding more vigorously to faces that were the same race as the study participant\u2026. We also found that the more dramatic the FFA response to a specific face, the more likely the study participants were able to recognize that stranger\u2019s face when they were shown the photograph again later, outside the scanner.\u201d\nIn other words, the experiment was the first neuroimaging study to uncover that we are both \n and \n hardwired to feel affiliation toward those who look like us. Even more, that there is \u201ca neural component to the same-race advantage in the face-recognition process.\u201d\nAnd, you know what? On a certain intuitive level, we \nknow this!\nTo demonstrate this, Eberhardt refers to the numerous recent cases of black teens snatching purses from middle-aged Chinese women in Oakland\u2019s Chinatown. At first, the police wondered why did the attacks targeted such a specific group of people, but, soon after, profilers unearthed the reason: the black teenagers knew that Chinese women would have problems differentiating between them and, thus, would be unable to identify them even if caught.\nAnd we all suffer from this type of racial blindness, which is the by-product of the same-race advantage in the face-recognition process. The less one has interacted with members of another race, the more they tend to generalize about that race.\u00a0\nAnd not merely in terms of psychology or behavior (that is, the intangibles), but also in terms of something quite visible and discernible such as appearance. Just as to an average middle-aged Chinese woman all black teenagers look the same, to an average black teenager, all Chinese middle-aged women are identical as well.\nHumans, as species, rely on this kind of \u201ccategorizing\u201d to manage information more efficiently. Whether we like it or not, it \u201cis a fundamental tool that our brains are wired to use. And the categorization process applies not just to people; it works on all things. Just as we place people into categories, we place other animals into categories. We place food into categories. We place furniture into categories. And we fill every category we develop with information and imbue it with feelings that guide our actions toward it.\u201d\nHowever, since categorizing precedes experience (\n), and since \n, we tend to notice only things that support our preconceived beliefs and ignore facts that contradict them. And we teach our children to do the same through our actions, conscious or unconscious.\nIt\u2019s a vicious circle we can best illustrate by taking a quote from the \u201cIntroduction\u201d to \n (rather than from the second chapter):\nPart II: Where We Find Ourselves\nRemember the case of Philando Castile?\u00a0\nBack in 2016, he was shot seven times by a policeman named Jeronimo Yanez in front of the eyes of his girlfriend and 4-year-old daughter after being stopped for a traffic violation.\u00a0\nAnd what about Tamir Rice?\nHe was just 12 years old and playing with a toy gun in a park in Cleveland, Ohio, when a 26-year-old police officer Timothy Loehmann shot him in the torso, before even parking his car. And he wasn\u2019t even charged with a crime.\nBlack lives matter\u2014but they matter less to whites. And the reason is simple: they don\u2019t see black people the way black people see each other: they see them as natural threats. Eberhardt did a couple of studies that uncovered that white police officers are more inclined to focus their attention on a black face after being shown a word related to criminal activity.\nIn other words, it is an unconscious association.\nThis is why even though merely 1% of all police interactions with civilians are non-violent, black people suffer the most: white police officers, even when stopping them for something minor, \nthem to be violent due to their preconceived notions and act accordingly.\nEberhardt and her team analyzed about 28,000 police stops between 2013 and 2014 to see if the hypothesis described above bears a relation with reality.\nUnfortunately, it does: based on the factual data, police officers disproportionately more often both stopped and arrested black residents even in the cases when blacks and whites were stopped for precisely the same violation. This, in turn, resulted in the quite expected reinforcement of the stereotype: more blacks are in prison, meaning more blacks \nbe in prison.\nThe numbers don\u2019t lie: 1 out of 4 black people was handcuffed during these police stops even when no arrest was made. The same held true for only 1 out of 15 white people. According to police officers, it was for safety reasons. And this is the best illustration of implicit bias you can find.\nTo make matters worse, the mass incarceration of African-Americans is becoming more and more problematic because the vicious circle goes in the opposite direction as well. Namely, just as white police officers don\u2019t trust \u201cmale blacks\u201d because they are polluted with this type of skepticism (both organically and culturally), \u201cmale blacks\u201d do not trust police officers either, because they feel that they are being discriminated; and so, they discriminate back.\nAs Jill Leovy pointed out in \n, in more than one way, in African-American ghettos, it\u2019s not gangs that produce lawlessness, but lawlessness that produces gangs.\nSo, the way out isn\u2019t \n imprisoned people, but, as paradoxically as it may sound, \n law:\nAs Michelle Alexander demonstrated in \n, mass incarceration is basically a modern variant of slavery, because it is not mostly an African-American problem\u2014but it is also, almost exclusively, an \n problem (with blacks).\nEven though African-Americans make up only about one-tenth of the overall population in the USA, almost half of the imprisoned men and women are African-Americans! That\u2019s a staggering discrepancy that, obviously, cannot be easily explained in any rational manner whatsoever.\nIt\u2019s not only that detention rates for blacks are four times higher than for white as we described above, but it is also that, on average, their bail is 35% higher!\nNo wonder a federal investigation following the death of Michael Brown \u2013 who was fatally shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri \u2013 discovered that blacks often suffer due to something they referred to as \u201cunlawful bias\u201d!\nOn March 3, 1991, Rodney King was violently beaten by LAPD officers during his arrest for fleeing and evading on California State Route 210. Even though the police officers spoke of Rodney King using unambiguous racial terms (equating African-Americans with apes) they were eventually acquitted, an event that sparked the 1992 Los Angeles riots.\nJust recently, \n: every time one of them touched the ball, supporters of the Bulgarian national team imitated ape sounds. And this is not an isolated incident: it happens so often, in fact, that numerous games have been halted because of this\u2014in France only.\nEberhardt demonstrates how this type of racial abuse is not isolated in time as well: it has a sound historical basis in many pseudoscientific theories of the 19\n century that presented African-Americans as sub-humans.\u00a0\nMany people nowadays believe this, even though it is a known fact that all humans have descended from Africa and share a common ancestry.\nPart III: The Way Out\nEven when stats show otherwise, most Americans (even blacks) tend to associate the presence of a majority of blacks in a neighborhood with higher crime rates. Because of this, modern American society is still segregated.\nAnd what does this lead to?\nHere\u2019s a good example: at Nextdoor.com\u2014a social network app which connects about 200,000 US neighborhoods\u2014even though most of the people go to sell something or find a good plumber, from time to time, a \u201csuspicious black man\u201d post appears.\u00a0\nThis type of racial profiling became a serious problem a few years back and the company contacted Eberhardt to find a solution. Eberhardt realized that all of these posts owe their existence to the implicit bias present in people: they judge these \u201csuspicious black men\u201d based on their appearance, and not based on their behavior.\nBut that\u2019s what tends to occur \n: the innate biases and categorizations buried within you flow to the surface because the brain has to make an instant decision. However, when you\u2019re thinking slow, you can rationalize the process.\nAnd that\u2019s what Eberhardt suggested Nextdoor should do: find a way to delay the posting of \u201csuspicious black man\u201d alerts. So, Nextdoor added some friction and since about two years ago, for the crime and safety tab, you can\u2019t just write\u2014you have to identify some behavior that is actually suspicious.\u00a0\nAnd this process includes \u201ca checklist of reminders\u201d that people have to click through before they can post something about someone \u201csuspicious\u201d:\n\u2022 Focus on behavior. What was the person doing that concerned you, and how does it relate to a possible crime?\n\u2022 Give a full description, including clothing, to distinguish between similar people. Consider unintended consequences if the description is so vague that an innocent person could be targeted.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t assume criminality based on someone\u2019s race or ethnicity. Racial profiling is expressly prohibited.\nThus, the people at Nextdoor managed to delay the initial response of concerned citizens, making its users think and slowing them down.\nThe result?\nThey managed to curb racial profiling by about 75%!\nAs everybody knows, racism and implicit bias can be tackled (and \n tackled) by the process of desegregation. The reason is obvious: the more time people of different racial backgrounds spend with each other, the less they are inclined to act on instinct for the simple reason that instinct can now give way to experience.\nHowever, \n people that are primed to despise each other into contact has precisely the opposite effect: it merely confirms biases and inevitably leads to serious issues. Finding common ground with someone your body and mind tell you is different from you can only be achieved through frequent contact\u2014and only over periods of time.\nUnfortunately\u2014and almost unconsciously\u2014we seem to have started treading a wrong path, as the result of which, according to research by the UCLA Civil Rights Project, \u201cthe number of intensely segregated schools\u2014where less than 10 percent of students are white\u2014has more than tripled in the past thirty years.\u201d\n people to go against their instincts without an explanation is what has this produced this outcome. Most whites think that it is rude to talk of skin color and oftentimes they omit this information even in the case when it is necessary. In addition, they don\u2019t talk about it at all.\n\u201cWhen people focus on not seeing color,\u201d writes Eberhardt, \u201cthey may also fail to see discrimination.\u201d To paraphrase Mellody Hobson\u2019s famous TED Talk, the fight against racism \n. People should talk about this openly and freely. And they should talk about it at school, where, unfortunately, so many things are taken at face value nowadays that, according to a 2017 survey, \u201conly 8 percent of high school seniors could identify slavery as the primary reason the South seceded from the Union. Nearly half of the students said it was to protest taxes on imported goods.\u201d\nSegregation is only one of the regresses we\u2019ve witnessed during the past decade, as anyone who saw even a single video of the white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017 would testify.\nUnfortunately, many white people in the USA are afraid of the changes in US demographics and have started posing the question \n. This has resulted not merely in the upsurge of prejudice against African-Americans, but also in the highly unexpected increase in anti-Semitic violence: just between 2015 and 2017, it spiked 60%!\u00a0\nBelieve it or not, according to a survey by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, 22% of young Americans who came of age in the twenty-first century have never heard of the Holocaust. And two-thirds of them\u2014meaning, four in ten Americans overall\u2014have failed to identify \u201cAuschwitz\u201d as a Nazi death camp!\nWhile we discuss the limits of free speech with people who are advocating equality, right-wing groups have slowly, but surely, regrouped and started \n things nobody believed would be repeated.\nBlatant bigotry is, unfortunately, not a relic of the past. \u201cIn truth,\u201d Eberhardt writes, \u201cbias has been biding its time in an implicit world\u2014in a place where we need not acknowledge it to ourselves or to others, even as it touches our soul and drives our behavior.\u201d\nOne in two white Americans (55% to be exact) believe affirmative action favoring African-Americans discriminates them.\u00a0\nAt the same time, many African-American graduates from top-tier schools \u201cwhiten\u201d their CVs (by, say, \n) so as to not trigger their interviewers\u2019 implicit bias. Needless to say, \u201cwhitened\u201d CVs \nget more interviews.\nImplicit bias, in other words, works inside us (and against those who are not like us) even when we say it doesn\u2019t: that\u2019s why it\u2019s called \n. That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard to eliminate it as well.\nHowever, uncovering cases of implicit bias at work does help because, for one, it paves the way for a rational (i.e. not \n) discussion, and secondly, it helps researchers get to the root cause of it and, thus, suggest ways we can tackle it.\nKey Lessons from \u201cBiased\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You Don\u2019t Have to Be Racist to Be Biased \n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 African-Americans Are Discriminated and Dehumanized\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Tackling Implicit Bias Is Difficult\u2014but Doable\nYou Don\u2019t Have to Be Racist to Be Biased\u00a0\n\u201cWhen people think about racism,\u201d says Jennifer L. Eberhardt in \n, \u201cthey\u2019re thinking about bigots. But you don\u2019t have to have a moral failing to act on an implicit bias.\u201d\nIn other words, even if you\u2019re consciously against racists and racism, you are implicitly biased because (as numerous studies have shown) you were programmed by evolution to love the people that are like you and doubt those that are not.\nThis is implicit bias, a sort of \u201cdistorting lens\u201d engraved in your eyes that, unfortunately, gets distorted even more by the disparities in our society.\nAfrican-Americans Are Discriminated and Dehumanized\nEven though African-Americans make up only 12% of the US population, they also contribute with staggering 40% to the total number of incarcerated criminals in the country.\u00a0\nIf you think that this is because they\u2019ve deserved it more\u2014Justice is blind and all that\u2014think otherwise: Eberhardt studied 28,000 random police stops made between 2013 and 2014 only to discover that African-Americans are habitually handcuffed (1 in 4 individuals) as opposed to white Americans (1 in 15)!\nMoreover, the bail for an average African-American detainee is, on average, 35% higher than the bail for a white American.\nThis is not because someone is consciously discriminating against African-Americans. It is because the people in our institutions are mostly whites and they are \n to discriminate unconsciously against people who are not like them.\nAnd this goes so far that experiments have shown that white people still think, unconsciously, of black people as something almost sub-human. Racists merely make this equation a bit clearer.\nTackling Implicit Bias Is Difficult\u2014but Doable\nSince it is implicit by definition, this discriminatory bias is difficult to be eradicated.\nHowever, there are some things that work to alleviate it:\n\u2022 Open discussions about cases of implicit bias (\n \nabout it is what has produced right-wing groups)\n\u2022 Adding friction in the decision-making processes: the faster a person should decide about something, the more instinctual their decision (that\u2019s why police officers often shoot African-Americans);\n\u2022 Creating desegregated schools (more contact amounts to more experience and more experience tends to negate bias over time).\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cBiased Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nBryan Stevenson, the author of \n,\ndeemed \n \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d shortly after publication and said that it presented \u201cthe science of bias with rare insight and accessibility.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd how can it be any different when, to quote the words of \nauthor, Carol Dweck, \u201cJennifer is one of the great thinkers and one of the great voices of our time.\u201d Dweck believes that \u201cher book will change the conversation on race in our society\u2013and perhaps our society itself.\u201dWe are not so optimistic, but hope for the same outcome. Because if this book doesn\u2019t convince you that what you believe and think you know is merely something that your brain wants you to \u2013 and is not necessarily based on reality \u2013 then very few books \n, let alone \n.\n\n"},

How? By turning distrust into determination, frustration into fuel, and heartache into hard work.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d she adds instantly, \u201cand that determination, fuel, and hard work? It can be so. much. fun.\u201d\nEven though born in the mid-1980s, Jaclyn Johnson has been a professional blogger/influencer for over a decade and a half. That\u2019s right: she was using theoretical hashtags before real hashtags were invented, she was a blogger before blogs became a thing, she made money out of the internet in the (as she calls it) PE-world (the pre-exclamation, pre-emoji age).\n\u201cI had happened into a career in a little something called \u2018social media\u2019 five years before it would hit the mainstream,\u201d she writes in the first chapter. \u201cI was a boss at Blogspot, \n, I was posting on forums (I know, #LOL), and I had a blog.\u201d\nEven though having a blog doesn\u2019t sound that remarkable nowadays, back in 2007 it was not only \u201ca rare thing,\u201d but also quite a chic-thing as well. The blog was called \n and was a mix of \u201ccut-out editorial collages\u2026 put together in PowerPoint,\u201d trends Jaclyn was loving, places to eat, playlists, outfit inspirations. etc. etc. A sort of a LiveJournal of Johnson\u2019s 20s, \u201can archive of inspiration, trends, and makers\u201d she had her eye on.\nApparently, a lot of people were reading SNON (3,000 a day!) and it wasn\u2019t that difficult for Johnson to get a job at Attention, now a preeminent global communications firm, but then just a start-up ahead of its time.\nJohnson was employee #3 and was responsible for social media \u2013 you know, before anybody knew what that actually meant. In fact, at Attention, they called it \u201cword-of-mouth marketing.\u201d \u201cSocial media as we know and heart it today wasn\u2019t really a thing,\u201d remembers Johnson, \u201cwhich means there was no snap, tag, or share yet. But there was Twitter, Facebook, blogging, and forums \u2013 all things I was familiar with and good at.\u201d\n\u201cInfluencers,\u201d goes on Johnson, \u201cif you don\u2019t already know, (mainly) started as bloggers \u2013 the girls taking outfit of the day (#OUTD) photos, DIYers, and the like \u2013 who turned their blogs into bona fide businesses\u2026 We \u2013 the influencers \u2013 had immediately seen the potential in this digital world. And because I understood the world from both the blogging end and the marketing end, I knew I was capable.\u201d\nAnd, indeed, Johnson \ncapable, so soon enough she was poached by a company larger than Attention, IAC (an acronym for InterActiveCorp), and tasked with leading their \u201csocial media\u201d efforts across multiple businesses \u2013 but mainly their startup Pronto (a now-defunct Amazon competitor).\nAnd, boy, what an upgrade this was: the job, Johnson tells us, \u201ccame with a director title, a six-figure salary\u2026 an unlimited snack section and a built-in espresso bar.\u201d And it was in New York, New York. Life couldn\u2019t be better, right?\nWell, it was so\u2026 for some time.\nBut then the dot-com bubble burst and the \n hit. Everybody around Johnson started losing their job and when one day she was called in for a meeting with the IAC\u2019s CEO, she knew she was getting the ax.\u00a0\nSurprisingly she was wrong: she was instead offered a new job at a sister company called CitySearch (\u201cthink Yelp\u2019s older, unrulier brother\u201d). Even though this meant traveling across state to LA, Johnson accepted the job.\nHowever, a female executive at CitySearch didn\u2019t like what she was doing; in fact, in a way, she didn\u2019t like the fact that the world in which she excelled was changing. Long story short, due to the female executive\u2019s preference for older soon-to-be-completely-out-of-date marketing methods (and her dislike of Johnson\u2019s no-nonsense, in-yer-face and \u201caggressive\u201d emails) fired Jaclyn.\nStill upbeat, Johnson tried to turn this closed door into an open window and at an age where most of us are still finding our way through college, she launched a promising company with a trusted business partner. Everything was going great until she discovered that her business partner (it\u2019s a \n once again) had made some \u201cdetrimental decisions\u201d for the company without her knowledge.\nA \u201cbrutal business breakup\u201d followed \u2013 the second massive blow in a fairly short time.\u00a0\nJohnson was 24\u2026 and unwilling to give up.\nIn the next eight years, she managed to sell the company, build a new (and even more successful) one, and add another digit to the six-figure salary of her IAC days. And she enjoyed every single minute of that!\nHow to WorkParty: Jaclyn Johnson\u2019s Guidebook\nHow, you ask?\nWell, by being aware that the \u201cwork hard\u201d interpretation of the American Dream she was raised on can be modified to suit better the feelings of our age. As she writes:\nHowever, Jaclyn Johnson wants you to know from the outset that she\u2019s not the Wolf of Wall Street or Toni Robbins and that neither her office is filled \u201cwith streamers and champagne\u201d nor she has some grand theory of life that she wants to impart on her followers through WorkParty.\nShe just wants to share the lessons she learned and the advice she wishes she\u2019d gotten when she was:\n\u2022 21 and at her first major job;\n\u2022 24, \u201cbright-eyed and a bit na\u00efve,\u201d launching her first business company with a partner;\n\u2022 28, and \u201cstriking out\u201d on her own;\n\u2022 or even 30, \u201chaving created and cultivated a community of over five hundred thousand women.\u201d\nAnd here are some of these lessons:\n\u2022 \n. Make your goal to become the person your colleagues recommend when they go to work at another company: especially at the start of your career, cultivating relationships with your colleagues makes all the difference.\n\u2022 \n. Being nice to people and contacting them from time to time always pays off: it\u2019s not only a career-builder but also a career-keeper \u2013 even when you make it. \n\u2022 \n. Misunderstandings are often the result of \n talking. And money misunderstandings are the worst. So, talk about money with your business partners openly and candidly before venturing into something bigger.\n\u2022 \n. Handshakes don\u2019t matter: an agreement is an agreement only when put on paper and notarized. If the court says so, you should as well.\n\u2022 \n. Treat everything as a real business \u2013 even if it looks like a creative sideline at the beginning. Who knows what that might grow into in the end?\nThe Ten Basic Rules for Pitching Your Business\nKnowing how to pitch your business to a potential client is not exactly something one is born with. Johnson offers ten pieces of advice on how to develop this all-important skill:\n#1. Start with writing down and \n that talk about what your company does.\n#2. Look for \n with the people who are in the room before making the pitch to them.\n#3. Understand your \n and prepare for market-related questions.\n#4. Never forget to define how your company is \n from the others, and, thus, can \n fill a certain \u201c\n,\u201d i.e., the place \u201cwhere unmet and unarticulated needs are uncovered to create innovation opportunities.\n#5. \n: stats, campaign, analyses.\n#6. \u201c\n:\u201d change the topic if you notice the attention of your listeners waning.\n#7. If you\u2019re seated, \nand demonstrate your presence.\n#8. Include \nand\nfrom past clients.\n#9. Say your \n out loud and without hesitation.\n#10. If you\u2019re making the pitch with colleagues, \n: contradicting your colleagues is one of the worst things you can do during pitching.\nThe Six Types of Employees Your Company Needs (and How to Hire Them)\nAccording to Jaclyn Johnson, there are six types of employees every start-up needs to succeed:\u00a0\n#1. \n \n: usually and preferably the CEO, this is the individual who sees both the big picture and the tiny essentials and moves rapidly toward success, with purpose and determination.\n#2. \n: this one is the individual who brings experience from other areas and who is organized and quick-witted enough to solve most problems that inevitably come along the way.\n#3. \n: the social connector, the energy provider, the one everybody loves for who he is, i.e., the hard worker who does everything with a smile and while caring for his colleagues.\n#4. \n: the one who \na suck-up to the boss and who is willing to say everything to their face, even if it\u2019s unpleasant.\n#5. \n \n: the one who prefers to help their colleagues than get credit for his work.\n#6. \n: the one who doesn\u2019t wait for permission to do something they feel right \u2013 even if that means regretting afterward.\nIf you want to gather your all-star team, these few tips & tricks will definitely help you:\n\u2022 Advertise the job with common, searchable words, rather than using unique and catchy titles.\n\u2022 Hire only someone who sees your company as a good fit for him \u2013 and not \nif it\u2019s the other way around.\n\u2022 Speaking of good fit: don\u2019t hire someone who doesn\u2019t know that much about the industry your company is in.\n\u2022 Find someone who laughs and seems positive under pressure.\n\u2022 Be honest with your new hires regarding everything, including possible pay rises and potential for upward mobility.\n\u2022 After the interview, ask yourself whether you could spend a few hours stranded with your new hire in an airport.\n\u2022 While on the topic, don\u2019t hire your friends: statistically, instead of contributing to the perfect work environment, this only leads to problems and difficulties.\n\u2022 Set up a three-month trial period and at least one in-depth review after a year for your new hire.\n\u2022 If things don\u2019t work out after the first or second milestone, don\u2019t give your new hire a second chance: fire them before it becomes even more complicated to do so.\nKey Lessons from \u201cWorkParty\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The New American Dream\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It\u2019s a Man\u2019s World \u2013 and Women Should Do Something About It\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 There Are More Than One Possible Path to Greatness\nThe New American Dream\nYou know what the old American dream is all about: work hard and inevitably success will come.\nHowever, as Johnson learned the hard way, there\u2019s also nepotism, political preference and all kinds of things that hard work cannot overcome that easily.\nSo, she offers an alternative to the old vision of the American dream: the WorkParty version.\nWorkParty means nothing more but working hard and with passion. That way, even if it doesn\u2019t work out in the end, you\u2019ll have no regrets \u2013 because you\u2019ll have enjoyed every single minute of your failure. And in that case, it\u2019s not really a failure, is it?\nIt\u2019s a Man\u2019s World \u2013 and Women Should Do Something About It\nUnfortunately, gender bias is a real thing \u2013 and it\u2019s something that has kept women out of the workplace for centuries. And even today, when there are so many successful women around, women don\u2019t advance in their careers because of gender bias.\nIn Jaclyn Johnson\u2019s experience, there\u2019s an even worse side to this bad side of the coin: sometimes, a woman\u2019s success is hampered not only by men but also by other women. \u201cBehind every great woman are great women,\u201d she writes suggesting that women should really do something about this because they need to help each other and not get in each other\u2019s ways.\nSo, consequently, there are two things women need to do to add a W and an O before the syntagma \u201cman\u2019s world\u201d: 1. to stop feeling the paralyzing imposter syndrome; 2. to turn to inspiring and successful women as their role models; 3. to discuss their experiences and be there for each other as often as possible \u2013 there are more men than women at leading positions, so if they don\u2019t stand for each other, they will be quickly overridden.\nThere Is More Than One Possible Path to Greatness\n\u201cNo truly successful entrepreneur these days has followed some preordained path to success,\u201d writes Jaclyn Johnson. \u201cThere is no \u2018right.\u2019 There\u2019s only saying yes, figuring it out, and knowing there will only be a few bumps along the way.\u201d\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cWorkParty Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\n, \u201c\n hilariously and oftentimes heartbreakingly captures the real struggles of being a risk-taking woman in the modern world. It\u2019s a much-needed combo of real talk, confessions and lessons learned along the way \u2013 it\u2019s sure to leave you ready to tackle, or give a middle-finger, to any obstacle in your way.\u201d\nAnd, indeed, beyond all the hashtags and unnecessary pop-culture references, it will probably achieve just that. And that\u2019s not because (as \n wrote) \u201cin \n, Jaclyn Johnson generously shares the secrets to her success: be nice, take risks, and work your butt off,\u201d but because of \n Jaclyn Johnson is: a 33-year-old female entrepreneur with an inspiring story.\nThe fact that her story is combined deftly in \nwith the stimulating stories of many other women who move the world around \u2013 Christene Barberich, Alli Webb, Morgan Debaun, Jen Gotch, Rebecca Minkoff, and Kendra Scott \u2013 makes it an even more \u201cif-we-did-it-you-can-too\u201d type-of-a-book.\nSo, do it!"},

And Why?\nIf you are interested in the history of exploration \u2013 and especially the exploration of the Antarctic region during the first quarter of the 20\n century \u2013 then \nis one of the classic books on the subject.\u00a0\nHundred years after the original expedition, Shackleton\u2019s endeavor is even more interesting to people who investigate the traits and essence of great leadership. See why.\u00a0\nAlfred Lansing Biography\n was an American journalist and writer, best known for his 1957 classic, \nBorn in Chicago on July 21, 1921, Lansing served the U.S. Navy during the Second World War and received a Purple Heart for being wounded during his service. Afterward, he enrolled at North Park College and later at Northwestern University, where he majored in journalism.\nHe edited a weekly newspaper between 1946 and 1949, before joining the United Press and becoming a freelance writer in 1952.\nWith Walter Modell, Lansing co-authored one of the last books from the Life Science Library, \n(1967). Just eight years later, he died, aged 54.\nPlot\nFirst discovered by a Russian expedition in 1820, the continent of Antarctica became an object of fascination for numerous explorers around the world during the last years of the 19\n century and the first two decades of the 20\n century. To history buffs and readers of exploration literature, this period is mostly known as the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration.\nFor a reason: during the Heroic Age, no less than 17 major Antarctic expeditions were launched from 10 different countries of the world. Though some of them had scientific interests, the primary object of most of these expeditions was, interestingly, to become the first expedition to reach the geographic South Pole.\nThat happened in December 1911, when \n Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen decisively beat the (ironically) better-remembered one led by a British Royal Navy Officer named Robert Falcon Scott.\nHowever,\nAlfred Lansing\u2019s Heroic Age classic, \nis not about Robert Falcon Scott\u2014a celebrated hero of his day and age, but also someone whose leadership qualities and competence of character have been questioned in recent times\u2014but about one of his officers during previous journeys, Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton.\nAnd it\u2019s not about merely reaching the South Pole, but about something even more daunting and unimaginable: crossing the entire continent from sea to sea, via the pole.\nWhy would someone set before himself such a goal? Well, maybe it\u2019s best if we dedicate the first two sections of our summary to answering this question.\nThe Protagonist: Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton\nBorn on February 15, 1874, in Ireland, \n is now widely considered one of the principal figures of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration.\nHis first experience of the polar regions came relatively early: he was in his 20s when he was assigned the role of third officer on Captain Robert Falcon Scott\u2019s landmark \nexpedition of 1901\u20131904 that was organized by the British Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society with the objective of carrying out scientific research and geographical exploration of the untouched continent.\nIt was during this trip that he, Scott, and another companion set a new southern record (82\u00b0S), which Shackleton would better just a few years later during the \nexpedition (88\u00b0S). However, when Amundsen reached the Farthest South latitude (90\u00b0S) on December 15, 1911, Shackleton was a bit shackled.\u00a0\nIt was almost as if he had nothing to accomplish anymore. But, restless and resolute as he was, just a few years later, he turned to the \u201cone great object of Antarctic journeyings\u201d remaining: transatlantic journey, i.e., crossing Antarctica from the Wendell Sea via the South Pole to McMurdo Sound.\nLansing describes Shackleton\u2019s appearance in a vivid manner:\nAnd then he adds something even more central about his character, something almost superhuman in an Ahab-or-\n-kind-of-way: \u201cWhatever his mood\u2014whether it was gay and breezy, or dark with rage\u2014he had one pervading characteristic: he was purposeful.\u201d\nThe Objective and the Plan of the Expedition\nThe British didn\u2019t take the news of the Norwegians reaching the South Pole before them lightly. Their record for exploration \u201chad been perhaps unparalleled among the nations of the earth,\u201d and now they had to take \u201ca humiliating second-best\u201d to a much less-renowned country.\nThings took a turn for the worst when the news of Robert Falcon Scott\u2019s tragic death reached England. The whole nation was saddened. In a way, Shackleton used this to his benefit while soliciting funds for his Trans-Antarctic expedition, playing \u201cheavily on this matter of prestige, making it his primary argument for such an expedition.\n\u201cFrom the sentimental point of view,\u201d he wrote once, \u201cit is the last great Polar journey that can be made. It will be a greater journey than the journey to the Pole and back, and I feel it is up to the British nation to accomplish this, for we have been beaten at the conquest of the North Pole and beaten at the first conquest of the South Pole. There now remains the largest and most striking of all journeys\u2014the crossing of the Continent.\u201d\nShackleton\u2019s plan\u2014which owed a lot to an abandoned one penned by Scottish explorer, William Speirs Bruce\u2014looked something like this:\nOf course, not everybody was impressed: in some circles, this undertaking was criticized not only as being too \u201caudacious,\u201d but also being kind of \u201cimpossible.\u201d Perhaps it had been both. But, as Lansing says, \u201cif it hadn\u2019t been audacious, it wouldn\u2019t have been to Shackleton\u2019s liking. He was, above all, an explorer in the classic mold\u2014utterly self-reliant, romantic, and just a little swashbuckling.\u201d\n(By the way, if you have problems following Shackleton\u2019s plan\u2014and the rest of his journey\u2014we sincerely advise you to \n: once again, Wikipedia\u2019s contributors have provided the most intelligible map on the Internet).\nThe Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition\nErnest Shackleton\u2019s 28-men expedition set sail on October 26, 1914, from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Nine days later, the ship (both prophetically and ironically\u2014for reasons you\u2019ll discover soon\u2014named Endurance) reached the first stop of the journey: the Grytviken whaling station on South Georgia. Whalers there reported something portentous: the conditions in the Weddell Sea were the worst they could remember.\u00a0\nShackleton\u2014for reasons explained above\u2014barely even took this into consideration. A month later, on December 5, 1914, Endurance left South Georgia. Unfortunately, just two days later it encountered the first ice pack on their journey. Somehow, they managed to sail through it after about two weeks. The fact they drifted about 60 nautical miles from their intended target didn\u2019t matter much: it was bearable.\nBut, very soon\u2014in the middle of January 1915, to be exact\u2014they happened upon another ice pack, some 200 miles from Vahsel Bay. This one they couldn\u2019t get through: they got stuck immobile inside and had no choice but to leave Endurance drift away with the pack ice for the next several months. Eventually, they lost sight of land completely: in fact, due to the Weddell Sea current, they started circling back to South Georgia and they were further and further away not only from their target but also from any land whatsoever.\u00a0\nTo make matters worse, soon the Antarctic summer (which coincides with our winter) ended and the endless polar nights began. \u201cIn all the world there is no desolation more complete than the polar night,\u201d writes Lansing. \u201cIt is a return to the Ice Age\u2014no warmth, no life, no movement. Only those who have experienced it can fully appreciate what it means to be without the sun day after day and week after week. Few men unaccustomed to it can fight off its effects all together, and it has driven some men mad.\u201d\nTo stop this from happening and neutralize the depression as much as possible, Shackleton organized Sunday evening gramophone concerts and monthly lectures by the Endurance\u2019s photographers, among many other jolly events that helped the sailors keep their spirits up.\nBy late October 1915, still frozen immobile in the enormous ice pack, Endurance drifted over 500 nautical miles to the north-east. To make matters even worse, the ice had thickened in the meantime and Endurance had to endure much more pressure from the surrounding pack.\nOn October 27, 1915, it finally succumbed: the ice started crushing the boat.\u00a0\nImmediately understanding the extent of this new misfortune, Shackleton had no choice but to order his crew to leave Endurance and start building a camp on a nearby floe of ice, while salvaging as much material and food as possible.\u00a0\nDuring the next month or so, everything was stockpiled on the floe. On November 21, 1915, Endurance entirely sank beneath the sea.\nSince the floe to which Shackleton\u2019s crew had initially set a camp had also crumbled under pressure in the meantime, the crew had to relocate. Hoping that a new ice floe will drift them to safety, on December 29, Shackleton sets a new camp on another ice pack, and dubs him \u201cThe Patience Camp.\u201d\nThe Patience Camp would be the crew\u2019s home for the first third of 1916. While there, they would make a few attempts to sled over the ice, but all of them would prove to be unsuccessful.\u00a0\nIt is only due to Shackleton\u2019s ability to motivate his people that the crew hasn\u2019t given up altogether at this point. They eat penguins and seals, occasionally killing dogs as well, to conserve food.\nIn March 1916, the ice floe where the Patience Camp is located successfully makes its way to about 60 miles from Paulet Island, but impassable conditions make floating to the island all but an impossible goal.\nSoon after, to the dismay of the crew, the ice floe begins to break, and Shackleton has to plan a trip to some kind of a nearby land\u2014using nothing more than three lifeboats.\nOn April 9, 1916, the ice pack breaks in two, and The James Caird, Stancomb Wills and Dudley Docker are launched for a voyage to Elephant Island, a remote and uninhabited island far from all shipping lanes. But also, at this point, Shackleton\u2019s crew\u2019s only hope.\nAfter six miserable days, the three lifeboats land on Elephant Island on April 15, the first time that the 28 men touch solid ground after precisely 497 days!\u00a0\nThough remote and uninhabited, Elephant Island is much more reliable than a lifeboat or an ice floe, so the crew is happy and relieved. Shackleton is not: he knows that this is merely the beginning of the rescue journey.\nBarely nine days after setting up a camp at Elephant Island, Shackleton chooses the five strongest men in his crew\u2014 Captain \n, second officer \n carpenter \n, and seamen \n and \n\u2014and the best boat\u2014the James Caird\u2014and sets off for South Georgia, where a whaling station is located and where he hopes to get some help.\nThe extremely dangerous journey lasts for two weeks. But finally, on May 10, the James Caird reaches the south coast of South Georgia! Unfortunately, they reach land there on the far side of the island.\u00a0\nSo, merely a few days after reaching South Georgia, the exhausted Shackleton, Crean and Worsley\u2014facing the fact that the James Caird is now too unseaworthy to use it to go round the island\u2014set out on yet another dangerous and never-before-done journey to reach the Stromness whaling station by crossing South Georgia on foot!\nAbout a day later, the three men are stirred to hear the sound of a factory whistle:\nFinally, the men reach the Stromness whaling station, and Worsley immediately sails back to pick up the three men left behind.\nThe mission is not complete, though: there are 22 men still on Elephant Island and they are all waiting to be saved.\nDuring the months of May and June, using borrowed ships (Southern Sky, Instituto de Pesca No. 1, and Emma), Shackleton embarks on a series of unsuccessful rescue attempts to reach Elephant Island, where the other men of his crew have, in the meantime, all but given up on hope.\nFinally, on August 30, 1916, during his 4\n rescue attempt aboard the steam tug Yelcho (loaned to him by the Chilean government), Shackleton reaches Elephant Island and rescues all 22 remaining members of his original expedition, 2 years and 22 days since leaving England.\nOn September 3, 1916, the Yelcho reaches Punta Arenas, with all 28 members of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition aboard.\nEndurance Epilogue\nAfter his death, the name of Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton\u2014who died in debts due to many failed business endeavors\u2014was largely forgotten by both his compatriots and the world, contrary to that of his one-time captain and longtime rival afterward, Robert Falcon Scott.\nHowever, in the decades that followed, things changed, and nowadays it is Scott whose heroism and leadership qualities are often questioned, while Shackleton\u2019s name has become almost synonymous with the word \u201cleadership.\u201d\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cEndurance PDF Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nThere\u2019s a reason why people remember Alfred Lansing for this book, and why they remember Shackleton\u2019s failed expedition primarily through it: \nis an exceptionally researched and beautifully written book on a topic\nAnd by \u201cbeautifully written,\u201d we mean \u201cwritten in a way they don\u2019t write books anymore\u201d: Lansing\u2019s prose belongs more to the 19\n century than to the modern age, but that should be off-putting only to those who, unlike the protagonist of the book, are not persistent and tenacious enough to swim through the breathtaking layers of meaning and reach the surface both richer and more perceptive.A classic of exploration literature, \nis a story of heroic failure, and since heroic failure touches people even more than heroic success, it\u2019s bound to remain engraved in your memory for quite some time.\n\n"},

And Why?\nHere at \n, we try to stay open-minded and unprejudiced, so we won\u2019t hesitate recommending this book to everyone who wants to learn more about their own health and remain healthy for longer periods of their life.\u00a0\nAfter all, even though (as we explain in \u201cOur Critical Review\u201d), the science behind Chopra and Tanzi\u2019s advice seems suspicious (to say the least), the advice itself is pretty commonsensical and can undoubtedly contribute to one\u2019s health.\nHowever, be wary: it is still a medicinal book not really endorsed by most members of the medical community.\nAbout Deepak Chopra and Rudolph E. Tanzi\n is an Indian-born American author, one of the most recognizable faces of the New Age movement, and \u201ca world-renowned pioneer in integrative medicine and personal transformation.\u201d\nChopra made his name in 1993 after being interviewed by Oprah on her show; three years later, he co-founded the Chopra Center for Wellbeing.\nHe is best known for \n; among other things, the book remained 72 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list and is still in print.\nFind out more at \n.\u00a0\n is the Joseph P. and Rose F. Kennedy Professor of Neurology at Harvard University.\nAn expert in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (and other neurological disorders related to aging), Tanzi has authored hundreds of articles in medical journals and co-authored four books, three of which are with Chopra: \n, and \n.\nA talented keyboard, Tanzi has also played keyboards on several rock albums, including one by Aerosmith.\n\u201cThe Healing Self PDF Summary\u201d\nThe most recent collaboration of Deepak Chopra and Rudolph Tanzi, \ncompletes a trilogy of books for the pair that started with \n in 2012 and continued three years later with \n.\u00a0\nThose familiar with either of these two books already know the basics of Tanzi and Chopra\u2019s approach: combining New Age mysticism with the latest advancements in medicine, the pair proposes a holistic theory of human wellbeing, according to which the distinction between organs and emotions, between physical and spiritual aspects of our existence, is not only exaggerated by scientists \u2013 if not completely wrong \u2013 but also \n to our health.\nIn other words, even the most severe mental diseases (such as Alzheimer\u2019s) can be prevented (even \n) via some adjustments in our lifestyles \u2013 from diet to relationships \u2013 and even the strangest spiritual beliefs can have positive effects on your health.\nis divided into two parts, the first of which deals with the more academic aspects of Chopra and Tanzi\u2019s theory (coupled with case studies and anecdotes), while the second is much more actionable and offers a 7-day action plan.\nPart One: The Healing Journey\nChopra and Tanzi\u2019s approach described in the intro above is often called in literature the \nbut the authors prefer the simpler \n which, in a single word, sums up its essence: \u201cbody and mind are one domain, and every organ, tissue, and cell works toward the same goal: sustaining life.\u201d\nAccording to the authors, this approach is neither mysterious nor unscientific, but, on the contrary, much closer to nature, since nature doesn\u2019t take into consideration human-made categories.\nThe bodymind approach to health, they say, \u201clooks beyond the artificial medical-school divisions into separate organs and the old skepticism about the mind-body connection:\u201d\n\u201cWhen a happy event occurs, such as falling in love, the whole system responds as messages course through the bloodstream, central nervous system, and immune system,\u201d they write. \u201cWhen a tragic event occurs like losing a loved one, the response is just as holistic, but the combination of chemicals in the signaling process is very different. What you experience subjectively as love or grief must have a precise configuration in the bodymind. If that didn\u2019t exist, you wouldn\u2019t have the experience.\u201d\nNow, modern medicine is skeptical of this bodymind approach. However, it\u2019s not like it has all the answers. In fact, as Chopra and Tanzi point out, it has very few answers and it\u2019s nothing short of a gambling model bound for breakdown at one point or another.\nFor example, we don\u2019t know why specific causes for certain diseases like a cold virus only make \n number of people sick \u2013 not everyone. And we don\u2019t know why the same therapy works for some people, while not in the case of others.\nMedicine almost never predicts what precisely will happen to the individual \u2013 it only speaks in percentages and possibilities. \u201cThere will always be someone who does everything right but gets sick anyway, while someone else who has paid almost no attention to their health dodges the bullet.\u201d\nThere are seven reasons why it\u2019s almost inevitable that one day, through no fault of your own, medical care would stop working for you:\n\u2022 The doctor doesn\u2019t know what caused you to get sick.\n\u2022 There\u2019s no drug or surgery that will resolve the situation.\n\u2022 The available treatments are too risky, toxic, expensive, or all three.\n\u2022 The side effects of the treatment outweigh the benefits.\n\u2022 Your condition is too far advanced to be reversed.\n\u2022 You\u2019re too old to treat safely or with much hope of recovery.\n\u2022 Somewhere along the line, a doctor made a mistake.\nWhen any of these breakdowns occur, whatever happens next is out of your doctor\u2019s control. After \u201cthree centuries of scientific medicine making huge strides,\u201d somehow, we\u2019re still suffering from some strange medical situations in the present:\n\u2022 An estimated 400,000 people die every year due to medical mistakes.\n\u2022 People are living longer and yet on average suffer about a decade of bad health and one to three years of disability at the end.\n\u2022 Two-thirds of cancers are preventable \u2013 and yet, cancer is still approached \u201cwith grim fatalism.\u201d\n\u2022 For some reason, \u201cthe average person feels helpless, confused, and anxious about getting sick and going to the doctor.\nIt\u2019s obvious \u201cthe gambling model for staying healthy needs to be replaced.\u201d But why should the bodymind approach be the replacement?\nIn July 2017, a \u201cstartling medical story\u201d hit the Internet: 24 experts on old-age dementia concluded that one-third of dementia cases \nbe prevented.\nHow, when no known medicine exists? Through some simple lifestyle changes, with a different focus at a different stage of life.\n\u201cTo reduce the risk,\u201d the study said, \u201cfactors that make a difference include getting an education (staying in school until over the age of fifteen); reducing high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes; avoiding or treating hearing loss in mid-life; not smoking; getting physical exercise; and reducing depression and social isolation later in life.\u201d\nOf course, one item stands out even if you merely scan the paragraph above: staying in school until over the age of 15.\u00a0\nHow is it possible that \naffects old-age dementia, you ask?\nWell, that\u2019s what made this medical story \u201cstartling\u201d: it was (in Chopra and Tanzi\u2019s words) \u201ca tip-of-the-iceberg story\u201d since it uncovered something that medical researchers have been dabbling in for quite some time \u2013 \n.\nIt\u2019s, in short, a fancy name for the finding that diseases start and can be prevented long before their symptoms appear. In the case above, staying at school until at least after your 15\n year means building up a \u201ccognitive reserve\u201d in your brain that counters Alzheimer\u2019s and other forms of dementia because it allows your brain some extra neural paths to follow if some grow weak or diseased:\nSo far so good: the earlier you start leading a proper life, the lesser the risk of contracting any kind of disease when you\u2019re older. Nothing mystical about that, right?\nHowever, as you might have deduced from the first section of our summary, Deepak Chopra and Rudolph Tanzi don\u2019t stop there: they think that there\u2019s a DNA-based reason for this connection and that it can be explained away by a simple \u201cleap of imagination.\u201d\nNamely, according to them, DNA doesn\u2019t change as slow as modern medicine would have us believe. AS the two argued in \n DNA is, in fact, something dynamic and ever-changing, something \u201ctotally responsive to a person\u2019s lifetime of experience.\u201d\u00a0\nBecause of this, Chopra and Tanzi believe that it is possible to supercharge your immunity, that is, to boost your body\u2019s innate immune response to external and internal attackers via your own conscious effort. It might sound sci-fi, but if you combine the way vaccines work with the bodymind connection, then it might seem a bit less strange.\nAfter all, what vaccines do is somewhat similar to \n: they expose you to external attackers in small amounts, and your body is prepared to deal with them in the future if they happen to come at full force.\u00a0\nHowever, until just a few years ago, modern medicine thought of the immune system as something isolated; studies such as the one published in 2017 reveal that we should stop thinking of our immune response in this manner. To make their case, Chopra and Tanzi introduce two new concepts: \u201ctotal immunity\u201d and \u201cthe healing self.\u201d\n\u201cTotal immunity is the measure of holistic health,\u201d they write, describing it as the full-body response to health risks, mind included. After all, the mind obviously has some effect on health, and the same holds true about the behavior, habits, and the contribution of one\u2019s family.\nTo make the above clearer, they use the term \u201cthe healing self\u201d which, according to them, satisfies \u201cthe real meaning of wholeness.\u201d \n merges the healer and the healed, turning a patient into a doctor long before a disease ever becomes apparent:\nThese are some of the benefits of the healing self:\n\u2022 It is noninvasive.\n\u2022 It involves no reliance on external therapies.\n\u2022 It maintains natural balance.\n\u2022 It boosts your immune system through lifestyle choices (which, in turn, can prevent many forms of cancer and hold promise for preventing Alzheimer\u2019s disease and even reversing symptoms of dementia).\n\u2022 When the healing self is taken into consideration, aging can become a combination of both \n as well as \n and not only the latter.\n\u2022 Drug dependency is staved off because healing occurs before the stage of symptoms begins. (\u201cThe vast majority of drugs are prescribed late in the disease process, a stage you don\u2019t have to reach if you act early enough. This is true for almost every lifestyle disorder, including heart disease and cancer, disorders that create the strongest need for drug treatments.\u201d)\n\u201cThe healing self is the choice maker who steps into the arena of everyday life and steers mind and body toward a lasting healing response,\u201d Chopra and Tanzi write. \u201cA paper cut goes away after a day or two; last winter\u2019s cold is a distant memory. The healing self, on the other hand, is long range. You set out to become whole, which is the only viable strategy for remaining healthy over a lifetime.\u201d\nWhen a person falls in love, to recommend inside their body. For one, some brain neurochemicals (such as dopamine and serotonin) increase, and the same happens with hormones such as FSH (the follicle-stimulating hormone) and cortisol.\nEven so, \u201cdespite the undoubted experience of falling in love at first sight and abundant evidence that love creates powerful physiological changes, the whole phenomenon remains mysterious,\u201d write Chopra and Tanzi.\nWhat\u2019s not mysterious, however, is that all of these physiological changes are beneficial to your health: you probably need no studies cited (and there are many) to know, from personal experience, that people in love are less depressed and less prone to stress. But let us go a step further: less anxiety also means fewer chronic inflammations. And fewer chronic inflammations decrease the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s, heart disease and diabetes.\nYou\u2019ve heard that right: love cures the heart much more literally than modern medicine would have you believe. This is how the bodymind works, the idea of the whole-body incarnate. Or as Chopra and Tanzi write:\nAs strange as the above might sound to you, one simple word might make you think it over: \n.\nNot even the most rigid scientists would question \n it works; on the contrary, ever since first observed, the only question modern medicine is dealing with concerning placebo is \nit works. And, according to Chopra and Tanzi, the reason why we still don\u2019t have the answer is that most scientists are unwilling to admit that some intangibles (they call them the Factor X) affect a health treatment.\nAlia Crum, \u201ca Stanford psychologist who led a 2017 study calling for more research into the nonphysical aspect of healing,\u201d is not one of these scientists and states the issues as clearly as possible: \u201cWe have long been mystified by the placebo effect,\u201d she is quoted saying by the authors. \u201cBut the placebo effect isn\u2019t some mysterious response to a sugar pill. It is the robust and measurable effect of three components: the body\u2019s natural ability to heal, the patient mindset, and the social context. When we start to see the placebo effect for what it really is, we can stop discounting it as medically superfluous and can work to deliberately harness its underlying components to improve health care.\u201d\nChopra and Tanzi believe that the reason why some medicines work only to a certain extent is that some people are their own placebos (i.e., they believe that they can be healed) while others don\u2019t. They write:\nThe good news is that the process of transforming your beliefs in the direction of healing isn\u2019t mysterious. Tanzi and Chopra offer seven steps that should help break down your negative beliefs step by step. Allow us to quote them in full:\n1. When you catch yourself saying anything that\u2019s negative, ask, \u201cIs this really true?\u201d Exposing an automatic reflex to rational questioning is an important step in letting go of it.\n2. When you start to examine a negative belief that has come up, ask, \u201cIs this really helping me?\u201d\n3. Be detached from the negative beliefs of others\u2014secondhand infection happens frequently.\n4. For every negative belief you expose, offer yourself two positive beliefs.\n5. Journal about your journey of self-exploration. Write down any changes in your belief system that you see are happening, or simply that you want to happen.\n6. Spend more time with supportive, loving, inspiring, and generally positive people. Avoid the opposite kind of people.\n7. Value the whole project of self-care and increasing your state of well-being.\nPart Two: Healing Is Now\nAs we mentioned in the introduction, the second part (and the second half, as well) of \nis a 7-day action plan. Here are its highlights. (By the way, bear in mind that you don\u2019t need to do everything listed every day\u2014choosing one and sticking to it on a weekly basis is more than enough.)\nMonday is entirely about improving your diet.\nSo, add some anti-inflammatory foods to it, such as berries, seeds, soy, garlic and ginger, whole grains, tree nuts, etc. Also, add some organic foods and increase the fiber in your diet. Take a probiotic supplement, and switch to olive or saffron oil. Drink coffee 1 to 5 times a day, preferably at the heavier end.\nAt the same time, cut down sharply on your sugar intake. Cut out junk food and fast food. Throw out stale food, including stale cooking oils and leftovers more than a day old. Reduce overall fat and salt intake. Needless to add, eliminate alcohol altogether.\nTuesday is about reducing stress.\nAnd you know how you can do that: do yoga, meditation, and practice mindful breathing and being centered.\u00a0\nAt the same time, try to walk away from stress as soon as possible, while refraining from ignoring stressful events in your life. On the contrary, make some time to examine a problem you have been putting up with out of frustration. Finally, turn irregular habits into a regular routine\u2014discipline always helps when stress is in question.\nWednesday is about adding years to your life and life to your years.\nTo do so, join a social support group and strengthen emotional bonds with family and close friends. If you are age sixty-five or older, take a multivitamin and mineral supplement. Maintain a balance of rest and activity. Explore a new interest. Take up a challenging mental activity.\nWhatever you do, don\u2019t be sedentary\u2014stand up and move throughout the day. Examine your negative emotions. Heal injured relationships that are meaningful to you. Be mindful of lapses and imbalances in your diet. Address negative stereotypes about aging and ageism. Consider how to heal the fear of death.\nIf you are working at the computer or at a desk job, stand up and move at least once an hour and walk five minutes for each hour you work. Take the stairs, not the elevator. Park your car far from your home and your office door. Spend more time with a physically active friend or family member. Walk for 20 to 30 minutes in the evening.\u00a0\nReplace 10 minutes of sofa time in front of the TV with a walk instead. Break the habit of waiting until the weekend to catch up on lost sleep. If you drink alcohol, do it early in the evening\u2014go to bed without alcohol in your bloodstream. Replace the midmorning coffee-and-doughnut break with a walk. Finally, examine your excuses for not being more active.\nWrite down five core beliefs and evaluate why you believe them. Put a core belief into action. Read a poem, scripture, or spiritual passage for inspiration. Have a family discussion about which core beliefs everyone holds. Take your favorite role model and list what core beliefs they held.\nOn the other hand, use Friday to also examine your negative beliefs as they relate to fear and mistrust. Open a line of communication with someone who holds radically different values. If you are stuck on a negative belief, be a devil\u2019s advocate and argue against it. End your participation in us-versus-them thinking.\nThe \u201cdo\u2019s\u201d for this day include taking an allowing attitude, approaching a situation without resistance, acting gracefully, and sharing responsibility, while encouraging areas of flow.\nThe \u201cundo\u2019s\u201d from which you should choose are: letting someone else have their way, helping reduce an area of conflict, stop resisting where you don\u2019t need to, and remove obstacles from someone else\u2019s path. Also, try to ease competition in favor of cooperation.\nFinally, Sunday is about evolving.\nDo\u2019s: be on the lookout for synchronicity (meaningful coincidences); change your daily narrative for the better; look for a chance to be compassionate; openly express love and appreciation; be generous of spirit.\nUndo\u2019s: resist the voice of fear; if you find yourself expecting the worst, step away from that expectation and remain neutral; if you have a negative thought that keeps returning, ask if it is truly serving you or is a relic of the past; if you feel emotionally upset, find a quiet place to become more calm and centered; finally, seek the company of people who inspire and uplift you.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Healing Self\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Chronic Disorders Begin Long Before the First Symptoms\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Healing Self and the Bodymind\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Factor X: Your Background, Love, Belief, Mindfulness\nChronic Disorders Begin Long Before the First Symptoms\nBelieve it or not, people who stay in school to the age of 15 are 8% less likely to get Alzheimer\u2019s than those who don\u2019t. The lesson: you can cure some diseases long before they become manifest in any observable way.\n\u201cPerhaps the major medical breakthrough of our time,\u201d writes Maria Shriver, the founder of The Women\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Movement, in a review of \n,\n\u201cis the discovery that most, if not all, chronic disorders begin years earlier than the first symptoms. We\u2019ve learned that about Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 that it\u2019s 20 years in the making. \n reminds us how important it is that we care for our brains and our bodies at the earliest stage possible.\u201d\nThe Healing Self and the Bodymind\nAccording to Deepak Chopra and Rudolph Tanzi, science has artificially cut the umbilical cord between the mind and the body when things such as one\u2019s health and immunity are in question.\nIn reality, they say, nature doesn\u2019t care about categorization and is absolutely disinterested in the different sections of a medical handbook. The mind and the body are connected \u2013 quite literally, through many neurotransmitters \u2013 which means that you can influence your health through your mind in a much more tangible manner than modern medicine believes.\nThat\u2019s why they use the term bodymind to speak of the wholeness of a human being, in addition to the term the healing self to express our body\u2019s capability to take on both roles of the healing process: the healer and the healed.\nThe Factor X: Your Background, Love, Belief, Mindfulness\nWhenever you\u2019ve been prescribed a certain therapy, your doctor merely bets on a certain outcome based on previous studies and experiences. However, nobody knows why some therapies work in some cases and don\u2019t work in others.\nTanzi and Chopra deem the difference the Factor X and think that it has to have a lot with the ignored bodymind connection and the wholeness of our experiences. In short, if you live a calm life filled with love and friends, if you meditate and eat healthily and if you believe that something will turn out for the best\u2014therapies should not only work but should become obsolete.\nDo the opposite, and after a certain point, no therapy will make you healthy ever again.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Healing Self Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nAs we wrote in the \u201cWho Should Read This Book\u201d section above, \nseems sound in terms of the validity of its pieces of advice, but a bit far-fetching in terms of the science explaining them.\nIn other words, while we\u2019d warmly recommend the second part of the book to anyone who wishes to live a healthier and happier life, we really don\u2019t think that anyone should consider this book as scientific when, by its own admission, it requires \u201ca leap of imagination\u201d to be fully grasped.\nScience is precisely the opposite\u2014knowledge that can be backed by experiments and experience\u2014and uses imagination only to hypothesize. And we kind of feel that Tanzi and Chopra take their hypotheses at face value without ever proving them.\nMoreover, we believe that the note \u201cWe certainly aren\u2019t advising you to ignore or avoid a physician\u2019s care when it is needed\u201d shouldn\u2019t be put merely in parenthesis in the \u201cIntroduction,\u201d but should be the first sentence in almost all of the chapters from Part One.But, then again, that\u2019s only our opinion. Our hope, interestingly, is that Tanzi and Chopra are actually right and that there are such things as \n and \n. If so, life would be much easier, and hospitals won\u2019t be necessary in the future. For now, the opposite is true. \n\n"},

And Why?\nIn the words of Cheryl Strayed, \n is \u201ca must-read for anyone who wants to face their fears, fulfill their dreams, and find a better way forward.\u201d\u00a0\nHowever, to quote the author herself, if you\u2019re easily offended by strong words and a curse or two here and there, then don\u2019t bother.\nAbout Marie Forleo\n is an American life coach, motivational speaker, web television host and bestselling author.\nDubbed \u201ca thought leader for the next generation\u201d by none other than Oprah Winfrey, Forleo is most famous as the host of MarieTV and the author of another self-help book \u2013 \n.\nFind out more at \n.\u00a0\nEverything is Figureoutable: The Secret of Super Moms\n\u201cMy mother has the tenacity of a bulldog, looks like June Cleaver, and curses like a truck driver,\u201d writes Marie Forleo in the very first paragraphs of \n. \u201cShe grew up the daughter of two alcoholic parents in the projects of Newark, New Jersey. She learned, by necessity, how to stretch a dollar bill around the block and is one of the most resourceful and industrious people you could ever meet.\u201d\nAnd that last part of the paragraph excerpted above is not an exaggeration: Marie\u2019s mom was able to fix the leaky roof and retile the bathroom all by herself, all the while listening to music from her favorite radio (gotten for free from Tropicana Orange Juice).\nOne day, when Marie came home, there was no sound coming from the radio. Instead, there were clicks and clacks coming from the kitchen. Marie followed the sound and eventually discovered her mother, huddled over the kitchen table, fixing her favorite Tropicana Orange radio.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Ree. No big deal,\u201d she said to her daughter when Marie asked her if the radio was broken. \u201cThe antenna got busted and the tuner dial was a little off, so I\u2019m fixing it.\u201d\nAwestruck and mesmerized by her mother \u201cworking her magic,\u201d Marie finally uttered the words that had been on her mind for quite some time: \u201cHey, Mom, how do you know how to do so many different things that you\u2019ve never done before, without anyone showing you how to do it?\u201d\n(Remember, these are the 1980s we\u2019re talking about, which means it was a \u201cpre-internet, pre-YouTube, pre-Google world.\u201d)\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Ree,\u201d Marie\u2019s mom replied. \u201cNothing in life is that complicated. You can do whatever you set your mind to if you just roll up your sleeves, get in there, and do it. Everything is figureoutable.\u201d\nChoose to Be Someone Else: The Magic of Belief\nThe last three words quoted above took root in Marie\u2019s soul.\u00a0\nEver since her mother uttered them for the first time, they have been the most powerful driving force in her life.\u00a0\nNo wonder they form the very title of her second book!\u00a0\nThe subtitle, in addition, describes Marie\u2019s opinion about their power better than we\u2019ll ever be able to: \u201cone simple belief to create unstoppable success.\u201d\u00a0\nThe emphasis here should be on belief. And why, you ask?\nBecause, in Marie\u2019s opinion, that\u2019s where everything starts. \u201cBeliefs,\u201d she writes poetically, \u201care the hidden scripts that run our lives. Like a track running underneath a train, our beliefs determine where we go and how we get there.\u201d\nYou see, humans are exceptional in that we have been given the gift of thinking. When Ralph Waldo Emerson writes that \u201cthe ancestor of every action is a thought,\u201d he\u2019s not being metaphorical as you might think.\nAnd that\u2019s because virtually everything you can see around you\u2014from your clothes and your books to your phone and your house\u2014was once \na thought, an idea, \u201ca wild, formless figment of someone\u2019s imagination.\u201d\nBut that\u2019s where the process of creation starts, which many people would simplify to these four steps:\nThought \u2192 Feeling \u2192 Behavior \u2192 Result\nMarie Forleo, however, thinks that we should add another step before these four. She writes:\nThis force that \u201cunderpins every action we take and how we interpret and respond to the world around us\u201d is, of course, our beliefs, which Forleo defines as the things you know \u201cwith total and absolute certainty\u2026 the root of our reality and our results.\u201d\nSo, that creation formula above should really look something like this:\nBeliefs \u2192 Thought \u2192 Feeling \u2192 Behavior \u2192 Result\nGet that: right beliefs bring great thoughts and feelings which affect our behavior and results in the wished-for outcomes.\u00a0\nWrong beliefs, on the other hand\u2026\nThe Problem with Our Beliefs, aka Eliminating Excuses\nWell, we don\u2019t even need to complete the sentence above, do we?\nForleo suggests that the problem with our beliefs is enormous and threefold:\u00a0\n#1. They are often instinctively created, and while we\u2019re not paying attention (through the power of the 5 Es: environment, experience, evidence, examples, and envisioning); \n#2. They are frequently self-limiting (because protecting yourself is much more important than risking it to become more than you are); \n#3. They are self-perpetuating (in that, if you don\u2019t think you can do something, you\u2019ll never try doing it, so the belief that you can\u2019t do it will remain unchanged).\nSo, in other words, unless you test out your beliefs, you\u2019ll never change them. More importantly \u2013 and this is the point Forleo is trying to make \u2013 untested beliefs are merely superstitions and excuses. In other words, \n.\u00a0\nAnd choices \n be changed.\nChoosing to believe that \u201ceverything is figureoutable\u201d means choosing to believe that there is a solution to every problem. It means realizing that all of your \u201ccan\u2019ts\u201d are actually \u201cwon\u2019ts,\u201d and that \n. Finally, it means making an effort to overcome your perceived limitations as opposed to embracing them in the form of excuses.\nBecause, really, once you think about it, all of your self-limiting beliefs are merely excuses:\nOf all the excuses, this is perhaps the most common. In reality, it doesn\u2019t hold water because you have plenty of time \u2013 you\u2019re just not using it right.\u00a0\n\u201cIf it\u2019s important enough, I\u2019ll make the time,\u201d Forleo writes. \u201cIf not, I\u2019ll make an excuse.\u201d\nThink of it this way: if your doctor told you today that you are going to die in two years or so, would you be able to find enough time for your friends and your passion projects?\nOf course you would!\nBecause you\u2019re spending quite a few hours on social media on a daily basis, you\u2019re answering emails even in your sleep, you\u2019re binge-watching Netflix shows constantly (yup, even the ones you don\u2019t really care about that much), etc. etc.\u00a0\nThe point?\n, it shouldn\u2019t be that difficult to use Facebook a bit less or watch one Netflix episode less than you would in a single day.\nThat already amounts to about an hour in a day or 45 full 8-hour workdays in a year, which Forleo translates into at least a draft of your book or a career change! And even with half of that \u2013 so, just 30 minutes a day \u2013 you get 22 full 8-hour workdays in a year or just about enough to learn how to meditate, build a brand-new website, or \n.\nYou don\u2019t have the time?\nOh, no: you are not making the effort to \nthe time!\nMore often than not, you don\u2019t even need the money!\nThere are so many free resources on the Internet that really, you\u2019ll find just about enough videos on YouTube only to learn any kind of new skill \u2013 not to mention all the MOOCs and free university courses available out there!\nBut, let\u2019s say that you \n need money for your business venture.\u00a0\nOnce again, there are a host of ways to get the financing you need \u2013 you just need to be determined, creative, and relentless enough to endure.\nForleo\u2019s has five suggestions to spark your imagination and only one of them doesn\u2019t start with \u201cS\u201d:\nThis is the flimsiest excuse of them all and Forleo doesn\u2019t waste too many words to refute it.\n\u201cWe live in the most unprecedented time in human history,\u201d she writes.\n\u201cThere are two kinds of people in the world,\u201d concludes Forleo, \u201cthose with reasons and those with results.\u201d\u00a0\nWhich one of the two do you \n to be?\nHow to Deal with the Fear of Anything\nOK, enough about the excuses! What about our fears?\nWell, first of all, it is important to note that everyone is afraid, from newbies to icons, from writers, performers and athletes to entrepreneurs, soldiers and scientists. (\n.)\nHowever, as French author Andr\u00e9 Gide wrote once, \u201cthere are very few monsters who warrant the fear we have of them.\u201d In other words, the more you understand something, the less you\u2019ll fear it.\nAnd this is what does the trick!\nAccording to Marie Forleo, the difference between successful people and you is not the type or the degree of your fears, but the way you interpret them.\nFor example, when Bruce Springsteen goes on stage \u2013 and this happens every time \u2013 his heart beats a little faster, his hands sweat a little, and his legs go numb as if he\u2019s getting pins and needles. However, he doesn\u2019t think of these feelings as fear \u2013 the symptoms of which are the same \u2013 but as \u201cexcitement.\u201d\n\u201cFascinating, right?\u201d quips Forleo. \u201cSpringsteen interprets those body sensations as a sign of readiness, not a sign that he\u2019s afraid, anxious, or incompetent. He\u2019s chosen to believe that the vibrations and sensations in his physical vessel are telling him he\u2019s prepared to give his fans a legendary performance. He\u2019s \n an interpretation that serves him.\u201d\nShannon L. Adler says that most misunderstandings in the world could be avoided if people would simply take the time to ask, \u201cWhat else could this mean?\u201d Well, Forleo thinks that most failures and millions of unfulfilled hearts can be avoided in much the same manner.\nBecause, in one way or another, what you fear the most is often what you want to do more than anything. \u201cNine times out of ten,\u201d Marie writes, \u201cour fear is directive. It\u2019s a signpost, pointing us in the exact direction our soul wants to go.\u201d\nYou\u2019re crippled by fear that your book won\u2019t be good enough so you haven\u2019t started writing it?\nYou\u2019re, in fact, told, and in no uncertain terms, by your very own body that you must put something on paper and you must do this fast.\u00a0\nThe moment you will, the amazing feeling of relief that will overcome your body will tell you that you\u2019ve been postponing the wrong thing all this time.\nFear is your soul\u2019s GPS.\u00a0\nFollow it.\nAnd never forget: no matter what happens on your journey, everything is figureoutable.\u00a0\nKey Lessons from \u201cEverything Is Figureoutable\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Impossible Is Only What You Believe Is\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Your Road Map to Results\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The World Needs Your Special Gift\nImpossible Is Only What You Believe Is\n\u201cWhat is now proved,\u201d wrote William Blake in his \na few centuries ago, \u201cwas once only imagined.\u201d\u00a0\nMarie Forleo goes a step further: and what was once imagined, she adds by implication, was a product of that person\u2019s beliefs.\nIn other words, if one doesn\u2019t believe that something is possible, one would never be able to picture it clearly, let alone proceed to the realization of that idea.\nJust think of what \n is doing right now, while you\u2019re reading this summary: he\u2019s building rockets that should take humanity to Mars in some not so distant future. Would he have even started doing that if he didn\u2019t believe it was possible?\nOf course not.\nAnd this is where Forleo\u2019s philosophy of life is rooted in. She firmly believes that your life will start getting better the very minute you stop believing that \u201cachieving your dreams are impossible\u201d and start using her mother\u2019s mantra: \u201ceverything is figureoutable.\u201d\u00a0\nYour Road Map to Results\nMarie Forleo\u2019s philosophy of life can be further described in a few actionable bits of advice \u2013 some of which she uses to introduce her book to her readers. Let\u2019s try to adapt them in an even more meaningful manner:\nInstead of thinking things like \u201cI know this already\u201d or \u201cThis won\u2019t work for me\u201d \u2013 Forleo calls these two sentences \u201cdestructive thought viruses\u201d \u2013 start constantly asking yourself questions such as \u201c\ncan I learn from this?\u201d and \u201c\ncan this work for me?\u201d\nUnfortunately, most of our beliefs are not only self-limiting but also quite unchangeable.\u00a0\nWhy?\nBecause they are not tested.\nThat\u2019s why you need to try doing things before denying that you can do them.\nThe everything-is-figureoutable philosophy of life is based on three rules of play:\n. All problems (or dreams) are figureoutable.\n. If a problem is not figureoutable, it\u2019s not really a problem\u2014it\u2019s a fact of life or law of nature (e.g., death or gravity).\n. You may not care enough to figure this problem out or achieve this particular dream. That\u2019s okay. Find another problem or dream that ignites a blazing fire in your heart and go back to Rule 1.\nYou know what that old adage implies: the uncommitted look for excuses; the ones who \n want to achieve something \u2013 look for a solution.\nOr as Forleo says, \u201cthere are two kinds of people in the world: those with reasons and those with results.\u201d\nThe truth is that your \nare actually \nbecause if you want to do something, you\u2019ll find a way to do it.\nOn the contrary, fear is your soul\u2019s GPS.\nWhat you fear the most \u2013 quitting your job, starting that book, investing in that new startup \u2013 is probably what you want to do more than anything.\nReinterpret your fears and follow them: they\u2019ll lead you in the right direction.\nMost people plan too much and do too little.\nThe problem is that they want to have all figured out in advance.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s not the right attitude!\nWhen you can, be a \u201cdoer,\u201d not a \u201cthinker.\u201d Overcome your indecisiveness by making the first step. Clarity will come afterward, as you make your progress.\nSpeaking of which, progress puts you in a productive mindset and that\u2019s the only thing you should strive for. Always tend to ask \u201cwhat\u2019s my next move?\u201d and not \u201cwhat will others think of this when I\u2019m finished?\u201d\nThe World Needs Your Special Gift\nFinally, and most importantly, never forget that you are a unique human being with unique qualities and the capabilities to make unique contributions to this world.\nYou have so much to offer. Overcome \n by talking about it with others and by doing the things that make you happy regardless of other people\u2019s opinions.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re not doing that, if you\u2019re crippled by fear and you\u2019re still making up excuses, you\u2019re actually \nfrom the people you love the most by not making the contribution only you can make.\nRepeat as if a mantra the words Marie Forleo repeats at the end of every \n episode:\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cEverything Is Figureoutable Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nDescribed as \u201ca dazzling manifesto on self-belief and self-empowerment\u201d by \n, \nis, to use the words of retired American soccer player and two-time Olympic medalist, Abby Wambach, \u201chilarious, relatable, and actionable.\u201d\nEndorsed by everybody from \n to \n, from \n to \n, Marie Forleo\u2019s book is really a powerful guide through excuses and fears to success and fulfillment \u2013 but it only makes sense if its bits of advice are implemented.\nSo, don\u2019t just read it \u2013 use it!"},

And Why?\nis justly marketed as the perfect book for human resource workers and managers: if you are one, Erikson\u2019s bestseller will undoubtedly help you categorize the employees you\u2019re in charge of into easily manageable categories.\nHowever, since it can help anyone do the same, it is also perfect if you want to build a more stable and more lasting relationship with someone, be that person a coworker, a friend or even a partner.\nAbout Thomas Erikson\n is a Swedish lecturer and author.\nHe has written three books so far. He made his name with \nin 2014, which has been translated into 40 languages so far and is one of Sweden\u2019s best-selling non-fiction books of the past half-decade.\nErikson\u2019s other two books can be described as sequels to his debut: \n is a book about manipulation, and the recently published \na book about, well, bad bosses.\nFind out more at \n.\u00a0\n\u201cSurrounded by Idiots PDF Summary\u201d\nThe word \u201cidiot\u201d is defined by the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as \u201ca foolish or stupid person.\u201d\u00a0\nAs far as Thomas Erikson is concerned, however, an \u201cidiot\u201d is merely someone who has a different behavior \n\u2014and, consequently, style of communication\u2014than the one dubbing him one.\nOf course, this is not something Erikson believed when he was young when he too \u201cpigeonholed people into two groups\u2014good and sensible people and all the rest, the people who didn\u2019t seem to understand anything at all:\u201d\nAnd how did Erikson\u2019s worldview change?\u00a0\nWell, when he was 25, he was supposed to interview a 60-year-old CEO by the name of Sture who told him that \u201che was surrounded by idiots.\u201d The more Thomas thought about this sentence, the less he was able to understand it.\n\u201cBut who hired all these idiots?\u201d he eventually asked Sture, fully aware that it could have been only him and nobody else.\nOf course, at this point, Sture wanted to fetch a shotgun and shoot Thomas (his words), but Thomas wanted to make a pretty important point.\u00a0\nNamely, even Sture didn\u2019t \n believe that he was surrounded by idiots: he was just incapable of \nwith them properly. And we\u2019ve already shared the reason with you: Sture didn\u2019t know that people have different behavior profiles and that you can\u2019t communicate with everyone in the same manner.\nAnd this is what Erikson\u2019s \nis all about: \u201cthe world\u2019s most widely used method to describe the differences in human communication.\u201d\nThe method is called the DISA or DISC system, acronyms that stand for Dominance, Inducement, Submission, and Analytic/Compliance ability. These four terms are the primary behavior types that describe how people see themselves in relationship to their environment. And each of these behavior types is associated with a color: Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue.\nBut before we get to the system itself and its applications, it would be a good idea to take a brief history tour.\nPeople Have Always Been Like This\nEven though the categorization of people in accordance with some theoretical behavior profile may seem like a modern invention, the truth is that in all cultures, there has always been a need to categorize people.\u00a0\nAnd interestingly enough, many of these categorizations can be considered precursors to the DISA system. Erikson compares it to the two most familiar.\nFour centuries before Christ, Hippocrates, the father of medicine, devised a theory that every person\u2019s temperament is the product of the (dis)balance between the four humors\u2014i.e., the four bodily fluids\u2014that flow inside him: blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm.\nThe system, further developed by the Roman physician Galen, is now called the humoral system, and it suggests that there are four fundamental personality types:\nAs you\u2019ll see in a moment, these four personality types correspond to the ones theorized by the DISA system: sanguine people are yellow, choleric are red, melancholic are blue, and phlegmatic are black.\nMany centuries after Hippocrates, on the other side of the Atlantic, the Aztecs developed a similar proto-psychological theory based on something they knew quite well: the four elements:\nOnce again, this system corresponds to the DISA behavior types: fire people are red, air people are yellow, earth people are green, and water people are blue.\nYou probably don\u2019t know this, but the guy who laid the foundations for the DISA/DISC model was also the guy who invented the lie detector and\u2014get this\u2014created the character of Wonder Woman!\u00a0\nAt least at the present moment, we can think of nobody as ludicrously versatile as Walter Moulton Marston.\nAnyway, Marston noticed that the distinct differences between people can be conveniently described via four different relationships between an individual and his environment, which he explained in this manner:\n\u2022\u00a0 \nominance produces activity in an antagonistic environment. \n\u2022\u00a0 \nnspiration produces activity in a favorable environment. \n\u2022\u00a0 \nubmission produces passivity in a favorable environment. \n\u2022\u00a0 \nompliance produces passivity in an antagonistic environment.\nErikson\u2014and most people nowadays\u2014use Stability instead of Submission and Analytic ability instead of Compliance (because these two relationships between an individual and other people/his environment seem to better explain people\u2019s behavior types) and further describe these traits thus:\n\u2022 \nominance relates to how a person approaches problems and deals with challenges. It is all about \n.\n\u2022 \nnspiration is about being able to influence and convince others to do something. Inspiration is about \n.\n\u2022 \ntability is about an individual\u2019s receptiveness to change, in that a strong need for stability means a person is resistant to change (the \u201cgood old days\u201d guy) and a lower need for stability means a more adventurous person. Stability is all about \n.\n\u2022 \nnalytic ability is about following rules and regulations. Analytical people can\u2019t accept that things may go wrong or happen at random. Analytic ability is all about \n.\nBefore we go one, here\u2019s one of the many wonderful graphs in \n: it sums up the above much better and it will make even more sense in the next section of our summary.\nAn Overview of the System\nNow, the system Erikson uses in \nis the DISA system. The only difference is that he uses colors instead of the four traits described above\u2014mainly because he has found out, via experience, that people remember the system better this way.\nIn Erikson\u2019s system:\n\u2022 Dominant people are Red people\n\u2022 Inspiring people are Yellow people\n\u2022 Stable people are Green people\n\u2022 Analytical people are blue people\nOr, to use a graph which mirrors the one above and makes all things very clear:\nIn the real world, only 5% of people have only one color that dominates their behavior, and over 80% have a combination of two colors along whose spectrum their behaviors can be described. The rest\u201415%\u2014are dominated by three colors.\nThroughout the book, Erikson focuses on the single colors individually \u201cbecause they are the fundamental components of a person\u2019s behavior.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like a recipe,\u201d he writes, \u201cwe need to understand all the ingredients before we bake the cake.\u201d\u00a0\nBefore we move to the colors, some interesting things to have in mind (and come back to once you finish the other section):\n\u2022 The most common behavior among people is Green in combination with another color (or even entirely Green behavior). The least common is entirely Red behavior or Red behavior in combination with one other color.\n\u2022 Blues and Reds, as well as Greens and Yellows, are complementary types: grouping people like that makes invincible teams (as well as long-lasting friendships and marriages)\n\u2022 Because in the real world, most people are dominated by two colors, here is the best combination in the spectrum: Blue/Green and Red/Yellow.\n\u2022 In most cases, Reds and Greens fail to work as a team, and, due to mutual disliking, are better off grouped otherwise.\n\u2022 Finally, Yellow and Blue is the worst combination among all: you don\u2019t want them in the same room, whether as workers, friends or lovers.\nNow\u2014onto the colors!\nBehavior Types: Descriptions, Perceptions, and Communication\n(\n):\nquick reaction, maximum effort to control, minimal interest for caution in relationships, direct action, tendency to avoid involvement\n: aggressive, ambitious, strong-willed, goal-oriented, pushing, problem-solver, pioneer, decisive, innovator, impatient, controlling, convincing, performance-oriented, powerful, results-oriented, initiator, speed, timekeeper, intense opinionated, straightforward, independent\n: driven, decisive, prompt, persuasive, resolute, competitive, determined, strong-willed, ambitious, independent, time-conscious, results-oriented\n: they keep their distance from others, have powerful handshakes, lean forward aggressively, use direct eye contact and controlling gestures\n: with Reds you have to be sincere, direct and argumentative; they hate beating around the bush and are less receptive if you use euphemisms; however, they will use any weakness in your argument against you, so stay strong and firm with them\n: Reds hate unchallenging and mundane tasks more than they hate Death itself, so if you want them on your team, give them something difficult to do (and, also, a team to command)\n: \n, Venus Williams, Margaret Thatcher, FDR, Barack Obama, Mother Teresa\n(\n):\u00a0\nrapid reaction, maximum effort to involve, minimal interest in routine, future time frame, impulsive action, tendency to reject isolation\n: talkative, enthusiastic, persuasive, creative, optimistic, social, spontaneous, expressive, charming, full of vitality, self-centered, sensitive, adaptable, inspiring, needs attention, encouraging, communicative, flexible, open, sociable, imaginative, easygoing\n: enthusiastic, inspiring, open, convincing, charming, optimistic, creative, easygoing, outgoing, flexible, spontaneous, communicative\n: they are tactile, relaxed and jocular, show friendly eye contact, use expressive gestures and often come close to the one they talk to\n: Yellows are most receptive when you are open and amiable to them, which means, try to laugh at their jokes and insert one or two yourself; also, since Yellows are disorganized, it\u2019s better to provide them with a detailed list of their responsibilities after the oral part of your discussion is over\n: Yellows don\u2019t want to be isolated, so don\u2019t put them in solitary offices; they also don\u2019t want to be surrounded by negative energy, so don\u2019t put them around Blues; finally, when they ask you to organize the next teambuilding event\u2014don\u2019t hesitate to say \u201cyes\u201d\n: \n, Robin Williams, Ellen DeGeneres, Pippin (from \n) and Han Solo (from \n)\n(\n):\ncalm reaction, maximum effort for connection, minimal interest in change, current time frame, supportive action, tendency to reject conflict\n: patient, relaxed, self-controlled, reliable, composed, loyal, modest, understanding, lengthy, stable, prudent, discreet, supportive, good listeners, helpful, producer, persistent, reluctant, thoughtful, conceal feelings, considerate, kind\n: friendly, considerate, predictable, discreet, calm, pleasant, stable, thoughtful, reliable, patient, team player, good listener\n: they are relaxed and come close, act methodically, tend to lean backward, use very friendly eye contact and prefer small-scale gestures\n: Greens don\u2019t want to be in the spotlight, so only one-on-one meetings with them should work\u2014even when you want to praise their work; on the other hand, when you criticize them, try to make sure they know that nothing is personal because they have fragile egos\n: Unlike Yellows, Greens like \n and don\u2019t want a sudden change in plans. So, don\u2019t make them redo the work they\u2019ve already done, and don\u2019t ever reassign them to new projects in the middle of an ongoing one.\n: Mr. Rogers, Mahatma Gandhi, \n, Jimmy Carter, Jesus Christ\n(\n):\u00a0\nslow reaction, maximum effort to organize, minimal interest in relationships, historical time frame, cautious action, tendency to avoid involvement\n: conscientious, systematic, distant, correct, conventional, seems insecure, objective, structured, analytical, perfectionist, needs time, reflecting, methodical, seeks facts, quality-oriented, scrutinizing, rule-following, logical, questioning, meticulous, reflecting, reserved\n: accurate, detail-oriented, orderly, systematic, cautious, logical, quality-oriented, thorough, correct, methodical, reflective, unassuming\n: they have closed body language and prefer to keep others at a distance, they either stand or sit, use direct eye contact and speak without gestures\n: when you talk with a Blue, have your facts and arguments prepared beforehand, because, unless you know the answers to all of their questions, they will not take your idea seriously; so, work out everything in advance\u2014minutiae included\n: Blues, unlike everybody else, crave for bureaucratic organization and want well-thought-out plans; however, they also want enough time and space to execute them properly, so tight deadlines would never work in their case\n: Bill Gates, \n, Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Spock (from \n)\nKey Lessons from \u201cSurrounded by Idiots\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Why Are We the Way We Are?\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ever Since Ancient Times, People Categorized People \n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 There Are Four Behavior Types\u2014and You Are Probably a Combination of Two of Them\nWhy Are We the Way We Are?\nIt is difficult to answer this question, but, as we\u2019ve told you before, it\u2019s mostly a combination of heredity and environment (or, to be more precise, \n.)\nErikson goes a few steps further and talks about core values, attitudes, core behavior, moderated behavior, and environment, still making clear that at least one or two of these aspects of our personalities are beyond our choice.\nHe even shares with his readers a neat equation:\nBEHAVIOR = f (P \u00d7 Sf)\nIn other words, \nis a function of \n and \n, where our \n is that which we can observe, \n is what we try to figure out, and \n are things that we have an influence on.\nEver Since Ancient Times, People Categorized People\u00a0\nEven though psychology didn\u2019t really exist before \n and \n, people have categorized other people in accordance with some system ever since Ancient Greece.\nIt was then that Hippocrates developed his humoral pathology, according to which there are four personality types: sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic, and melancholic. The Aztecs developed quite a similar system as well, categorizing people in accordance with their relationship with the four elements: firey, airy, watery and earthy.\nIn the 20\n century, however, a guy by the name of Walter Moulton Marston developed a modern version of these categorizations called the DISA system, an acronym for the four most important traits according to the author: dominance, inspiration, stability (or submission, originally) and analytic ability (or compliance, originally)\nThere Are Four Behavior Types\u2014and You Are Probably a Combination of Two of Them\nThomas Erikson\u2014and many modern HR theoreticians\u2014developed Marston\u2019s system further and have now, for mnemonic reasons, color-coded it.\nAccording to Erikson\u2019s explanations in \n, people are either dominantly Red (dominant, direct, active), Yellow (inspiring, impulsive, influential), Green (stable, calm, supportive) or Blue (analytical, slow, cautious).\nOnly 5%, however, are exclusively dominated by one color, and just 15% can be described in a three-color range. The rest\u201480%\u2014are dominated by two colors.\nSee our explanations above and find out which are \ntwo colors.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cSurrounded by Idiots Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\n\u201cA useful guide to communicating with the uncommunicable,\u201d \nis (according to \n) a \u201cdynamically presented and easy to grasp\u201d exploration of human behavior types.\nTrue, some of the book\u2019s generalizations seem unconvincing and even far-fetched, but, in our opinion, the best aspect of the book\nis precisely its simplicity and directness, both in terms of the main idea and in terms of the author\u2019s style.\u00a0And we do believe (with \n) that most people can benefit from this book, especially those in the workplace.\n\n"},

And Why?\n is one of those books that are bound to touch you in one way or another: a marvelously written \n, it feels both as a children\u2019s book and a serious exploration of beauty, obsession, and lost causes.\nWe recommend it to anyone who loves to read\u2014and especially to those who prefer long books to movies, and haunting prose to special effects.\nDonna Tartt Biography\n is an American writer.\nIncluded in TIME magazine\u2019s \u201c100 Most Influential People\u201d list in 2014, Tartt has authored only three novels, each of them lauded by critics and general readers alike: \n, \n, and \nTartt won the WH Smith Literary Award for \nand the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for \n \n. In addition, her short story \u201cThe Ambush\u201d was included in the anthology \n \n.\nPlot\n is a coming-of-age tale told in retrospective first-person narration by its main protagonist, \n. At 800 pages, it touches upon so many subjects that no summary of its story will ever do the book any justice.\nAnd this is even less true than in the cases of some other \u201cunsummarizable\u201d books we\u2019ve shared with you so far because \nis written in an exceptionally beautiful and hauntingly inspiring prose. You\u2019ll understand what we have in mind, once you read the few excerpted parts below, especially the paragraph which concludes the novel.\nThough, just like Theodore, the book\u2019s story constantly skips between places, it revolves around the whereabouts of an exceptional painting by Rembrandt\u2019s most gifted student, Carel Fabritius. Unsurprisingly, the painting is also titled \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d and, if you like, you can see it, in all its mysterious majesty and timeless beauty, by clicking \n.\nAlso, if you want to, you can click \u201cPlay\u201d on the video below and watch the trailer of the very recent adaptation of Donna Tartt\u2019s novel\u2014which, we regret to say, does the book even less justice than our summary.\nThe Dividing Mark\nTheodore \u201cTheo\u201d Decker is merely a 13-year-old boy when his mother takes him to the New York City\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art on an exhibition of Dutch masterpieces so that she can view her favorite painting: Fabritius\u2019 \u201cThe Goldfinch.\u201d\u00a0\nLittle does Theo\u2019s mother know that this would be the last day of her life. And only years later would Theo understand that this would be the day which would irretrievably alter his life.\nAs the lines above anticipate (or rather reveal), during the visit of the museum, Theo\u2019s mother, just like several other visitors, is killed\u2014the result of a bomb attack by a right-wing home-grown extremist group.\nIn the rubble, half-present due to the experienced trauma, Theo notices \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d and takes it with him.\u00a0\nIn a way, as we are about to learn, the event is much more than just a simple theft. It is one of the main symbolic transactions of the story, for, by the end of the book, it is fairly evident that the painting has taken the place of Theo\u2019s lost mother.\nThe Old Man, the Red-Haired Girl, and the Barbours\nEven before the bomb attack in the museum, Theo\u2019s attention is attracted by a beautiful red-haired girl walking with an elderly gentleman.\u00a0\nDuring the immediate aftermath of the wreckage, Theo happens upon this man, by that time already dying from severe wounds.\nThe man gives Theo a ring and, with his dying breath, instructs him to go to Hobart and Blackwell and ring a green bell there. Theo takes the ring and promises to do so.\nSince Theo\u2019s father, \n, is anything but a father, social services try to place Theo in another home. However, Theo has a better idea: he asks them to move with a school friend of his, \n,\nwhose family is extremely rich.\nAnd so he does, taking \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d with him.\nAt the Barbours\u2014who live in a large apartment at Park Avenue\u2014Theo tries to adjust to his new life. However, the best thing he can do for a while is, expectedly, to grieve. Fortunately, due to the low lighting and its vastness, the Barbours\u2019 apartment is at least a great place for that.\nHowever, it is not a great place to hide in, since \n regularly uses it to host charity events, so Theo feels as if he is on display together with the antique furniture. On top of that, Theo also has to regularly deal with Andy\u2019s two younger siblings, \n and \n, who resent his presence because they feel their parents are more concerned about him than them.\nWhile at the Barbours, Theo remembers the ring and the instructions from the old man at the Metropolitan, so he decides to carry out his last wishes.\u00a0\nHe rings the green bell at Hobart and Blackwell and, there, he learns that the man who gave him the ring was none other than one of the two owners: \n. He forms a connection with the other one,\n, and is more than happy to see the red-haired girl at the antique shop once again.\nHe learns that her name is \n and that she has lived with Welty and Hobie ever since her mother (Welty\u2019s half-sister) had died of cancer several years back.\nIn addition, he becomes pretty aware that he has some strange, but rather deep, feelings for this girl who is soon after sent to live with blood relatives.\nThe Return of the Prodigal Father and the Appearance of Boris\nJust as the Barbours ready to adopt Theo, his father, together with his girlfriend, \n, resurfaces from absolutely nowhere and decides to take him to Las Vegas; Theo has no choice but to follow him, taking \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d with him.\nIn Las Vegas, things are looking bleak until, one day, Theo accidentally meets (at a crowded bus stop) a dark-haired boy who grows to become his best friend, \n.\u00a0\nAs you can easily deduce from his name, Boris is not an American: he is the son of Ukrainian \u00e9migr\u00e9s and has lived all around the world before arriving in America: Scotland, Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Sweden.\nBoris is similar to Theo in more than one way. His mother (his father\u2019s second wife) has been dead for a while, and he too has been raised by an alcoholic father who severely beats him from time to time.\u00a0\nThe two spend most of their afternoons drinking, smoking marijuana, and experimenting with all kinds of drugs\u2014each of these activities either a way out of the unbearable present or a step down the ladder of self-destruction.\nSpeaking of self-destruction, Theo\u2019s father gets drunk one day and dies in a car accident, leaving Theo an orphan with neither a plan or a vision for his own future.\nScamming in New York City\nLeft alone and faced with the possibility of being placed in foster care, Theo steals some money from Larry\u2019s girlfriend, takes her dog and heads off to New York City.\nAfter wandering the streets of the Big Apple, he eventually arrives at the doorstep of Hobart and Blackwell, where he is welcomed by Hobie and spends some time with Pippa, visiting on break from her school for troubled teens, located in Switzerland.\u00a0\nThe narrative next skips eight years, and we see Theo well versed in the antique trade. So much so that, in the meantime\u2014as we soon find out\u2014he has managed to become Hobie\u2019s business partner. He is also engaged to none other than \n, whom he has started to date after the death of Andy and his father due to a sailing accident.\nThe engagement aside, Theo is actually still in love with Pippa, and Kitsey has an affair with one of Theo\u2019s most despised classmates: \n. They both find out about each other\u2019s feelings but decide to remain engaged\u2014for convenience.\nEven though Hobie loves him very much and believes him unconditionally, Theo\u2014now addicted to prescription medication\u2014has been using the antique shop as the hub for a business scam, selling restored antiques as valuable originals.\nTrue, this has saved Hobie from bankruptcy, but it has also betrayed his trust\u2014which is why Theo is racked by guilt. He is also racked by fear because \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d is still with him, and he learns that a group of people who, during the museum bombing, stole treasured artwork, has now been found and arrested.\nConcerned about himself but almost as much about Hobie and Pippa, Theo hides the painting in a rented storage locker. Somehow, one of the victims of his scam, a guy named \n, has put two and two together and tries to blackmail Theo by threatening to tell the police that Theo is using \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d for criminal activities.\u00a0\nCorrectly believing this to be a bluff, Theo dismisses Reeve and his claims.\nThe Returns of the Prodigal Friend\nSoon after, Theo runs into Boris on the streets of New York. Due to dubious and unnamed activities, Boris is now a wealthy man with a developed network of collaborates.\nTo his astonishment, Theo learns from Boris that Lucius Reeve was partly right: \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d has been used as collateral by him and other drug dealers for the past few years.\nHow is that possible, you wonder?\nSimple: Boris stole \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d from Theo back in Las Vegas and left a high school textbook in its place. In disbelief, Theo checks the storage unit only to discover the veracity of Boris\u2019 words.\u00a0\nFeeling guilty, Boris devotes himself to recovering the painting, and, at Theo\u2019s engagement party, he comes with a plan to reclaim \u201cThe Goldfinch.\u201d\nSoon after, the two fly to Amsterdam where they meet the dealers who have the painting. Boris and his associates do manage to steal the painting, but, at the last moment, they are confronted by armed henchmen.\nIn the ensuing conflict, one of the dealers escapes with the painting, Boris is shot in the arm by the other, who is, in turn, killed by the confused and fearful Theo. Boris sends Theo to an Amsterdam hotel, and Theo remains there for weeks, drinking and taking drugs on a daily basis.\nSince he doesn\u2019t have his passport and has just committed murder, he is afraid to leave his room, let alone the hotel. He even contemplates suicide, but before he can enact his plan, Boris reappears yet again, carrying with him a great deal of money with Theo\u2019s name on them.\nIts source?\nWell, believe it or not, it is half of the reward he has collected from the police for informing on the dealers. Even better, this act has resulted in the police recovering \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d and returning it to the museum.\u00a0\nThe Goldfinch Epilogue\nFeeling as if he has already lived through several lives, Theo returns to New York City, only to be confronted by Hobie, who has learned from Lucius all about Theo\u2019s business scam. Theo has a plan to make amends: to use the reward money to buy back the fake antiques and restore the business\u2019 honor.\nAnd that\u2019s it\u2014that\u2019s how the novel ends. Just like in life, everything is left open-ended. Though Hobie remains close to Theo despite the betrayal, Pippa leaves and is forever lost: even though she loves him, she assures Theo that she could never be romantically involved with him.\n\u201cI feel I have something very serious and urgent to say to you, my non-existent reader, and I feel I should say it as urgently as if I were standing in the room with you,\u201d Theo speaks to us at the end of his confession, before sharing a few rather bleak lessons.\n\u201cThat life\u2014whatever else it is\u2014is short. That fate is cruel but maybe not random. That Nature (meaning Death) always wins but that doesn\u2019t mean we have to bow and grovel to it. That maybe even if we\u2019re not always so glad to be here, it\u2019s our task to immerse ourselves anyway: wade straight through it, right through the cesspool, while keeping eyes and hearts open.\u201d\nAnd he goes on, so memorably:\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Goldfinch PDF Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nhas to be one of the most polarizing novels published in the last decade or so.

How about the original one?\nIf so, you\u2019re in luck\u2014today, we have for you the summary of Truman Capote\u2019s most celebrated and genre-defining book:\nWho Should Read \u201cIn Cold Blood\u201d? And Why?\nIf you like true crime books such as John Grisham\u2019s \n, Michelle McNamara\u2019s \n, or Bryan Stevenson\u2019s \n, then \nshould be the next book on your reading list.\nIt is not only the first major true crime book\u2014it is also, by many accounts, the best one, both in terms of style and influence.\nTruman Capote Biography\n was an American writer, screenwriter, and actor.\nAfter discovering his calling as a writer at the age of 8, he spent most of his teenage years perfecting his writing abilities. At 19, he had already penned one of the most celebrated short stories of the 20\n century, \u201cMiriam,\u201d and soon after he got his first book deal.\nTwo years later he published \n, his first novel, which, together with the novella \nand \nis considered a literary classic.\nMany of Capote\u2019s works have been adapted for the screen, several more than once.\nPlot\nWidely considered the best non-fiction novel ever written\u2014and so highly regarded that it is sometimes incorrectly assumed to be the original one (though it is certainly the first major non-fiction novel, it has a few predecessors)\u2014Truman Capote\u2019s \nis a book that defies categorization and transcends genres.\nFirst published in 1966, it novelizes the 1959 quadruple murder of the Clutter family by Richard \u201cDick\u201d Hickock and Perry Smith but does so with such rigorous attention to detail and veracity that it is difficult to say which parts of it are fictional and why.\nIt took Truman Capote six years to investigate the story\u2014which he did in the company of his good friend, \n\u2014and the writing process exhausted him so much that he never finished another book until the end of his life, 18 years later!\nSince it is based on a true crime independent of the way the book tells it, there are numerous ways to summarize the story, but we decided to be faithful to Capote\u2019s non-fiction novel.\nChapter I: The Last to See Them Alive\nThe book begins on November 14, 1959, the last day on earth for four members of the Clutter family: the patriarch, \n, his wife \n, and their two teenage children, \n (16) and \n (15).\nTruman Capote uses the first chapter of \nto set the stage for their impending murder in an almost cinematic manner, switching back and forth between the ordinary happenings in the Clutter family and the planning of their murder by \n and \n\u2014two recently paroled ex-convicts\u2014who are driving in their direction.\nSo, while Smith and Hickock are driving around, buying rope and rubber gloves, and discussing whether to buy stockings as well, the members of the Clutter family are going about their day as if it is just an ordinary day.\nHerb, a well-respected, church-going and prosperous farmer adored by the community, wakes up early and eats his breakfast before going out on the farm to conduct his daily farm chores.\nHis daughter Nancy talks to Susan, a friend of hers, on the phone about a boy she\u2019s been dating named \n, and, later on, teaches another friend named \nhow to make a cherry pie.\nMeanwhile, Kenyon\u2014ever interested in manufacturing things and fixing cars\u2014is making a hope chest for his sister in the basement recreational room.\nAt about this time, an insurance salesman arrives and starts a discussion with Herb. He is later seen leaving the premise immensely satisfied, having made a hefty deal for a life insurance policy with Herb.\nAs Dick and Smith are nearing ever more to the farm of the Clutters, they are visited by Bobby, Nancy\u2019s boyfriend, who has dinner with the family. After watching some TV with them later on, he leaves at about 11 PM.\nCapote cuts the story here and transfers us to the next morning, when \n, a friend of Nancy Clutter, arrives at the house for a visit. No one answers her knocks and calls, so she asks the housekeeper where are the Clutters.\nSince he is all but sure that they are home, he goes with her to investigate. The two eventually go inside the house only to reveal the four lifeless bodies of the Clutter family scattered around the floor.\nThe peaceful town of Holcomb, Kansas is shaken to its very foundation upon hearing the news. People begin to meet and gossip (mostly at Hartman\u2019s Caf\u00e9), discussing possible suspects and most of them fearing that the murderer is probably somebody they know.\nThe real murderers have, of course, fled the town. Perry has spent the night in a hotel, and Dick with his family in Oklahoma, to whom he tells that that he has come straight from a visit of Perry\u2019s sister in Fort Scott\u2014the reason for his journey.\nChapter II: Persons Unknown\nThe Kansas state police (or KBI for short) begins its investigation, with detective \nacting as the leader. Though there are not many leads, Dewey suspects that the murder is done by more than one killer; however, he is unable to find a motive, since almost nothing is missing from the house.\nMeanwhile, in Olathe, a town of Oklahoma, Perry and Dick sit in a diner. Though both of them are starving, Perry is unable to eat, crippled by fear that they will be found. Even so, he still has enough strength to bully Dick into admitting that they killed a whole family on a piece of incorrect information.\nNamely, they expected to find a treasure inside the home of the Clutter family, and they left with nothing more than a pair of binoculars, a small portable radio and about $50 dollars in cash.\nAs Dewey is following tips from overly concerned citizens back in Holcomb, Perry and Dick head off to Mexico City, where they befriend a German tourist named Otto and where Perry confesses to Dick that he had never killed a man before, despite telling him the opposite.\nHowever, they have to leave Mexico soon after due to their inability to go on paying their hotel bills\u2014which they have been paying with bad checks anyhow.\nAfter their return to America, an old letter sent by his father, \n, to his parole officers, incites a stream of memories in the head of Perry, and Capote uses this moment to give us a sketch of Perry\u2019s previous life.\nWe learn that his parents divorced when he was a child and that he spent most of his early years being raised by his alcoholic mother. He even tried to run away from her once, but he was turned away by his father once he got to him.\nEventually, after his mother died from choking on her own vomit, Perry and his siblings were sent to a Catholic orphanage, where, supposedly, he was repeatedly beaten by the nuns for his bed wetting habit.\nAt 16, Perry joined the United States Merchant Marines, and in 1948, he joined the Army as well. He served in the Korean War and received an honorable discharge four years later. Soon after he bought a motorcycle and nearly died after losing control of it due to adverse weather conditions.\nHe spent six months in the hospital after this accident, recovering only to a certain extent: due to the severity of the injuries, he would go on suffering chronic leg pain until the end of his life. As a consequence, he also grew to become a painkiller addict.\nBack in Holcomb, Dewey is unable to find any kind of lead to help him, and the town grows increasingly impatient with the fact that nobody is arrested even after so many weeks.\nChapter III: The Answer\nRelaxing in his cell, a prisoner by the name of \nhears the news over the radio of the murders of the Clutter family. Even though he can guess the identity of one of the murderers right away, it is only weeks after this event that he decides to contact the police.\nHow does he know anything about the murder even with being in his jail cell all this time?\nWell, because it was he who gave the incorrect information to his former cellmate Hickock that Herbert Clutter\u2014for whom Floyd Wells has worked in the past\u2014has a $10,000 fortune lying around at his house! Moreover, he has heard Hickock talking about his plans to rob the Clutter family\u2014he never bothered to stop or correct him!\nThe KBI knows right away that this is a strong lead. So, \n, a KBI agent starts following it, heading straight to Hickock\u2019s home in Oklahoma, where he learns about his supposed visit of Perry\u2019s sister on the night of the murder.\nAnd that\u2019s where he heads next. As expected, in San Francisco, Perry\u2019s sister Barbara reveals to him that she has seen neither her brother nor Dick for a long, long time.\nIn the meantime, in a pretty dumb move, Dick and Perry return to Kansas to exchange some bad checks for money, and Dick even uses his own name to sign them. This doesn\u2019t escape the police and Harold Nye phones Al Dewey with the info. However, the two escape before Dewey can get to them and travel to Miami.\nOn December 30\n, 1959, Dewey finally receives a long-awaited phone call: Dick and Perry have been arrested in Las Vegas. He, Nye, and two other KBI agents immediately head there to question the suspects. Despite the fact that they are being questioned by the Kansas police, the murderers are not worried: they are sure that they have been arrested for passing bad checks.\nHowever, after some time, in two different rooms, both Perry and Dick are faced with the real reason for their capture. Though both of them deny any involvement in the murders, Nye and Dewey notice that they look shaken.\nThe very next day, Dick cracks and admits everything, repeatedly claiming that it was Perry who had killed all four Clutters. After realizing that Dick has already confessed, Perry tells a different story, claiming that the women were shot by Dick.\nChapter IV: The Corner\nPerry and Dick are kept in the Garden City jail where they are asked by a psychologist to write autobiographies chronicling their youth. Perry takes the assignment seriously, but Dick is much more casual and disinterested.\nPossibly because he is planning to escape using a shiv which he has created from a brush. However, as his diary reveals, this shiv is later discovered by the sheriff which kills some of Dick\u2019s hope. Perry\u2019s hope is expressed in the form of fantasies of someone saving him unexpectedly, but, deep down inside, he knows that this will never happen.\nSoon after, the trial begins, and Floyd Wells testifies and corroborates the state\u2019s case. Dewey does the same, describing in detail what happened on the night of the murders. It is too gruesome and brutal to be summarized here, but let\u2019s just say that it involves everything: binding, gagging, a slit throat and four .12-gauge shotgun shots.\nUnsurprisingly, Dewey\u2019s description shocks everybody present, including the judge, who doesn\u2019t allow a psychologist to testify in favor of Perry\u2019s insanity. Had he allowed him, Capote says, the psychologist would probably have said something along these lines:\nThe verdict comes as no surprise to anyone: Perry and Dick are given the death sentence and sent to the death row section of Lansing Penitentiary.\u00a0\nIn Cold Blood Epilogue\nAt Lansing, Dick spends most of his time writing to different organizations for help, and Perry tries to starve himself to death until a letter from his father intervenes. Unlike Dick, Perry is passive, isolated, and even stranger than before. According to Dick, nobody likes Perry there\u2014himself not excluded.\nAfter several delays, five years after the first trial, Perry and Dick are finally executed on April 15\n, 1965. Before being hanged, Dick shakes hands with four KBI officers and apologizes. Perry does the latter as well.\nDewey leaves the execution site feeling unsatisfied. He remembers running into Susan, Nancy\u2019s friend, at the graveyard recently. Susan told him that Bobby Rupp has found a girl in the meantime and is now married. She also said she was doing well herself.\nAs Dewey says \u201cGood luck\u201d to her thinking how Nancy might have been just her kind of a young woman, the wind starts whispering through the grass of the graveyard.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cIn Cold Blood PDF Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nTruman Capote was already a nationwide celebrity even before \n, but after the publication of this book, he became a star in circles far beyond the literary ones.\nAn immediate sensation, the book was declared a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d by many critics, and nobody has changed his mind to this very day.\n\u201cThe book is neither a who-done-it nor a will-they-be-caught,\u201d wrote Tom Wolfe in an essay the following year, \u201csince the answers to both questions are known from the outset\u2026 Instead, the book\u2019s suspense is based largely on a totally new idea in detective stories: the promise of gory details, and the withholding of them until the end.\u201d\nHow\u2019s that for originality, ha?"},

And Why?\nWidely admired, \nis one of the best and most thrilling scientific books you\u2019ll ever have the chance of reading. So, if you are interested in these kinds of books, it should be high on your reading list.\nEven if you are not\u2014give it a go: sometimes, it feels as if you are reading a novel. And it is almost so alluring that it is unputdownable.\nAbout Richard Preston\n is an American journalist and bestselling scientific author, a contributor to \never since 1985.\nHe has written seven exceptional nonfiction books\u2014\n \n, and\n\u2014and a well-received novel, \n.\u00a0\nHe was also chosen to edit and complete the unfinished manuscript of \n, Richard Crichton\u2019s final novel.\nPreston is the only nondoctor to have received the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s Champion of Prevention Award. In addition, he has also received an award from the American Institute of Physics.\n\u201cThe Hot Zone PDF Summary\u201d\nThe first major non-fiction novel, \n, may be dealing with gory quadruple murder, but, in terms of sheer horror, it has nothing on Richard Preston\u2019s \n,\nhis 1994 account of the first emergence on US soil of one of the deadliest viruses known to men: Ebola.\nIts subtitle\u2014a terrifying true story\u2014more than suits it: enthralling, fast-paced and exceptionally well-written, the book would have been an incomparable thriller even if it hadn\u2019t been based on factual events.\nFor better or for worse, it is.\nAnd it goes something like this.\nPart One: The Shadow of Mount Elgon\nIt\u2019s January 1980, and a Frenchman by the name of \n (a pseudonym) decides to visit Kitum Cave on Mount Elgon in Western Kenya, on the border with Uganda.\nIn case you don\u2019t know, the Kitum Cave is one of the five \u201celephant caves\u201d on Mount Elgon\u2014all of them rich with salts, all of them frequented by these majestic creatures who go deep inside the cave to dig for salt ever since time immemorial.\nCharles Monet\u2019s decision to explore the cave, however, was a fatal mistake: a week after the visit, he starts vomiting and becomes ill with a serious fever. He is flown to Nairobi Hospital, but already on the plane he\u2019s in such a bad state that we\u2019ll simply decide to skip the description.\nAt Nairobi Hospital, he begins to hemorrhage, and gets some of his blood and vomit on his doctor, \n. Dr. Shem Musoke is unable to do anything in Monet\u2019s case and, before too long, Monet dies.\nUnfortunately, just soon after, Dr. Musoke starts showing the same symptoms. He hemorrhages badly since his blood refuses to clot and, consequently, all of his organs begin to fail, one by one. Since now it is Dr. Musoke who needs a doctor, \nsteps in.\nUnlike his colleague and patient, he doesn\u2019t particularly feel like dying, so instead of working closely with his patient, he sands a sample of his blood to two labs\u2014in South Africa and in Atlanta, Georgia. The diagnosis is devastating: the extremely dangerous Marburg virus, a Risk Group 4 pathogen of the family Filoviridae, or filoviruses.\nEverything you need to know about this family of viruses, for now, is that you don\u2019t want to mess around with any of its members. The Marburg virus may not be as deadly as its \u201ccousins,\u201d but it kills 1 in 4 people.\nAnd, oh, yes, and about its cousins: the Ebola Sudan (or Sudan virus) and the Ebola Zaire virus have some of the highest mortality rates, being twice and four times scarier than the Marburg virus!\nStrangely enough, Dr. Shem Musoke survives and doesn\u2019t infect anyone else with the virus. His blood is then sent to many institutions all over the world so that the virus can be studied more closely.\u00a0\nAnd that\u2019s how it reaches the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), which we\u2019ll just refer to as Institute from now on because we don\u2019t want to be unkind toward our readers.\nOne of the employees at this Institute\u2014at a Level 4 laboratory\u2014is \n \n, who, just like her husband, \n, is\na veterinarian by trade. Nancy\u2019s job is quite simple: she (in the presence and with the help of her superior, \n) is supposed to dissect monkeys who have died from the Ebola Zaire virus.\nAnd the man who infects them with it?\n, a man obsessed with the Ebola virus pretty much to the same extent as others are not. Needless to say, Gene is infecting monkeys with Ebola not because he is some kind of sadist, but because he wants to find a cure. And since he never has, Nancy and Tony always have something to dissect on their tables.\nAnd this is even more difficult and stressful than dissecting a frog on your biology class: even a single contact with the virus guarantees a visit of the morgue.\nFour years later, Gene Johnson receives samples of blood from another man\u2014or, rather, a boy. This time it is a deceased 10-year-old from Denmark by the name of \n.\nThe tests conclusively discover the Marburg virus inside Peter\u2019s blood. And logic discovers something else, even more interesting: since Peter too has explored Mount Elgon\u2019s Kitum Cave, the virus must be lurking somewhere inside it. Its direct source, however, cannot be revealed despite Gene Johnson\u2019s massive efforts.\nMeanwhile, Nancy and Jerry Jaax are promoted, both of them to lieutenant colonels. In addition, Jerry becomes the head of the Institute\u2019s veterinary division, and Jerry becomes its chief of pathology.\nParts Two & Three: The Monkey House and Smashdown\nSince the second and the third part of \nboth deal with the same case\u2014the Reston epizootic\u2014we\u2019ve decided to group them under a single title.\nIn the suburb of Reston, Washington, DC, in the autumn of 1989, a company called Hazleton Research Products installs a monkey house (the Reston Primate Quarantine Unit) inside a one-story building in a small office park.\u00a0\nIf you don\u2019t know what a monkey house is, it is precisely what you might guess from its name: a place that stores imported monkeys and holds them in quarantine for a month before shipping them across the US.\nOne day in October,\n, a consulting veterinarian at the Reston Primate Quarantine Unit, noticed something strange: a large number of some newly imported monkeys start dying. By November the situation gets worse, so Dalgard contacts the Institute.\nHe sends some samples to two scientists, \n and \n, who are surprised to notice, at first sight, that the cells from the samples are practically destroyed. They try to garner more information by smelling the culture, and the absence of smell suggests to them that it must be simian hemorrhagic fever\u2014a highly pathogenic virus in monkeys, but one that is also harmless to humans.\nThey are, of course, wrong.\nWhen they analyze the cells under a microscope, they discover that the cells are infected by a filovirus. Even though they fear that they have been exposed, they keep this information a secret, and relay the rest to \n and \n.\nIn time, the news becomes even worse: as Jahrling discovers, the virus is either the deadliest form of filovirus (Ebola Zaire) or some unknown very close relative of this virus.\nEither way, it\u2019s time to be alarmed.\nSo, everybody is\u2014including the Jaaxes, Dalgard, \n (who oversees the USAMRIID), the local authorities, the Pentagon.\nDespite everything, Dan Dalgard is relatively calm.\nHowever, one day, an employee of his, \n, suffers a heart attack. Fearing that it might be Ebola-related, Dalgard contacts the Institute which gathers samples from Purdy and several monkey corpses.\u00a0\nWhile Nancy is dissecting, the others (Dalgard, Johnson, C.J., General Russell) hold a meeting during which they decide it is not smart to take any more risks and agree on putting the Army in charge of euthanizing the monkeys.\nThe operation is conducted in secrecy so as to not alert the press or cause panic in the public. Even so, it is a dangerous one, since the monkeys in question (mostly crab-eating macaques) are not friendly toward humans and have sharp teeth.\u00a0\nHowever, it is a necessary one, since the bodies of the monkeys dissected by Nancy are virtually destroyed, meaning the virus they are dealing with is so dangerous that euthanizing all of the monkeys is the only risk worth taking.\nCase in point, an employee of the monkey house by the name of \nbegins vomiting. As he is taken to the hospital, soldiers storm the monkey house and start killing the animals.\nThe operation, fortunately, runs smoothly, with only one of the monkeys escaping\u2014but only briefly. Everything else goes according to plan.\nSoon after, tests on Milton Frantig\ndiscover that he is infected with the virus. The same is true in the case of Jarvis Purdy and two other Reston employees.\nThree questions arise: 1) why didn\u2019t the first tests show this; 2) how is it possible that all four men have remained virtually symptomless, one or two vomiting episodes aside; and 3) why aren\u2019t other men infected by now?\nSoon, all of these questions are answered, but in a rather strange and unexpected way, thanks to another group of infected monkeys who arrive at Reston soon after from the Philippines.\nThe Army decides to not intervene this time, leaving the monkeys to die out naturally.\nWhat they discover is startling!\nNamely, they weren\u2019t infected before coming to Reston: they got infected afterward. How could that be when the Ebola Zaire virus is not airborne and can only be transmitted through contact and blood?\nWell, it is because it was never the Ebola Zaire virus in the first place. It is a new, fourth strand of the virus now referred to as the Reston strand, the most dangerous of them all as far as monkeys are concerned. It is basically the Ebola Zaire virus plus the ability to transmit through air.\nFortunately, unlike the Ebola Zaire virus which kills 9 out of 10 infected people, for some unknown reason, the Reston strand doesn\u2019t seem to affect humans.\nDescribing it, Preston writes:\nPart Four: Kitum Cave\nThree years after the events described in the first three parts, Richard Preston decides to do something no normal man would ever want to do after reading this book, and something investigative journalists can\u2019t help but doing: visit the scenes of the crime.\nYup, Preston decides to visit both Kitum Cave and the Reston monkey house.\nWhile traveling to Kitum, he contemplates about the emergence of another virus immensely popular and frightening at the time \nwas published: HIV. According to him, it gets easier with every year for viruses to spread: one of the unexpected negative effects of globalization.\nAfter reaching Kitum Cave, Preston is amazed at its beauty and overwhelmed by feelings incited by the fact that he has come where his story had once begun. After putting on a spacesuit, he steps inside, only to leave after a few moments, terrified that he may be infected.\n\u201cThe emergence of AIDS, Ebola, and any number of other rain-forest agents appears to be a natural consequence of the ruin of the tropical biosphere,\u201d he writes in the chilling concluding chapters, going on to say that:\nWith thoughts such as this in his mind, Preston travels to visit the now-abandoned monkey house at Reston. Everything is back to normal there (sort of), life springing yet again inside the facility, in all kinds of forms: plants, insects, spiders.\n\u201cEbola had risen in these rooms, flashed its colors, fed, and subsided into the forest,\u201d writes Preston in the last two sentences of the book. \u201cIt will be back.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Hot Zone\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You Don\u2019t Want to Mess with Filoviruses\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 What the Ebola Virus Does to a Human Body\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Viruses, the Immune System of the Earth\nYou Don\u2019t Want to Mess with Filoviruses\nFiloviruses are a family of viruses named so because, under a microscope, they resemble a filament, or a short thread (\nis Latin for thread).\nThere are a number of filoviruses, and all of them are classified as Risk Group 4 Pathogens by the World Health Organization. The four Richard Preston deals with in his book are:\n\u2022 \n: Named after a city in Germany where its first major outbreak killed many people at a factory in 1967; it has a mortality rate of 25% in humans;\n\u2022 \nAn aggressive form of Ebola whose first known outbreak killed 181 out of 284 people in Sudan in 1976; it has a mortality rate of 50% in humans;\n\u2022 \n: The most hostile form of the Ebola virus which kills 9 out of 10 people infected with it.\n\u2022 \n: Discovered in Reston, USA, by accident, the Reston virus is almost the same as the Zaire Ebola virus, but though it is as lethal to monkeys, it doesn\u2019t seem to affect humans.\nWhat the Ebola Virus Does to a Human Body\nIn short, the answer to the question above is\u2014it annihilates it. Attacking almost all types of cells, it dissolves the human tissue, practically liquifying organs and shutting down bodily functions one by one.\nSince it also causes severe hemorrhages (from absolutely everywhere), many victims die due to losing too much blood.\u00a0\nInterestingly enough, that may be a kind death in the case of Ebola.\nViruses, the Immune System of the Earth\nThe last part of \nis especially chilling since Richard Preston uses it to express his opinions about these viruses (including the then-discovered HIV) and delivers an accurate description, which, for once, isn\u2019t anthropocentric.\nWhat if\u2014he asks\u2014what if all these viruses (Ebola, HIV, etc.) are simply Earth\u2019s immune system, its automatic response to the number of humans on Earth? What if, in some way or another, in the grand scheme of things, we\u2019ve become unbearable to it? What if finding a cure for \n is not what we\u2019re supposed to be looking for?\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Hot Zone Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nhas been deemed both one of the best science books ever written (\n) and\n\u201ca top-drawer horror story\u201d (\n).\nIf you don\u2019t believe the latter, just ask Stephen King, according to whom \nis \u201cone of the most horrifying things\u201d he has ever read.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat a remarkable piece of work,\u201d he adds afterward, echoing precisely our very first thought after finishing the book.

Ladies and gentlemen, we present to you the summary of:\n.\nWho Should Read \u201cBetween the World and Me\u201d? And Why?\nIf you are interested in US politics or history, then it is only fair that you hear it told through the mouths of those who were silenced for centuries (and are still silenced throughout the country). Especially if they are as eloquent and argumentative as Ta-Nehisi Coates.\nAlso, if you are a black man and want to hear all about the realities which face you in America, then \nis the best place to start your journey to self-discovery.\nAbout Ta-Nehisi Coates\n is an American journalist and writer.\nA national correspondent for \u201cThe Atlantic,\u201d he has also worked for \u201cTime\u201d and \u201cThe Village Voice\u201d and \u201cTime\u201d and has written text for numerous other publications.\nHe is, however, most famous for his books: \n(a collection of essays), and \n, his first novel.\nFind out more at \n\u00a0\n\u201cBetween the World and Me PDF Summary\u201d\nEmulating the structure of James Baldwin\u2019s \n, Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 poetic, touching and piercingly accurate analysis of \u201cracist violence that has been woven into American culture\u201d takes the form of a letter addressed from the author to his fifteen-year-old son, Samori.\nThe letter is divided into three chapters, the first of which recounts Coates\u2019 experiences as a young man, the second of which talks about his life after the birth of Samori, and the last one of which narrates the author\u2019s visit of Mabel Jones, a grieving mother of a mistakenly murdered African-American friend of Coates.\nAnd we have all of them covered in our summary!\nChapter I\nCoates begins his letter to Samori by describing an event from the Sunday before: a host of a popular news show asking him what it means to lose his body.\n\u201cSpecifically,\u201d the author goes on, \u201cthe host wished to know why I felt that white America\u2019s progress, or rather the progress of those Americans who believe that they are white, was built on looting and violence. Hearing this, I felt an old and indistinct sadness well up in me. The answer to this question is the record of the believers themselves. The answer is American history.\u201d\nIn other words, Coates says that the great country of America exists in large part due to the fact that part of its population was never given the chance to exist. Though Americans deify democracy almost as much as God, most of American history is extremely undemocratic.\nIn fact, when President Lincoln declared, in 1863, that the battle of Gettysburg must ensure \u201cthat government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth,\u201d he didn\u2019t have Coates\u2019 grandfather in mind.\nAccording to the laws of the time, Coates\u2019 grandfather, simply and brutally put, wasn\u2019t a person, wasn\u2019t part of the people:\n\u201cI write you in your fifteenth year,\u201d says Coates a little below.\u00a0\n\u201cI am writing you because this was the year you saw Eric Garner choked to death for selling cigarettes; because you know now that Renisha McBride was shot for seeking help, that John Crawford was shot down for browsing in a department store.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you have seen men in uniform drive by and murder Tamir Rice, a twelve-year-old child whom they were oath-bound to protect. And you have seen men in the same uniforms pummel Marlene Pinnock, someone\u2019s grandmother, on the side of a road.\u201d\nAll these people\u2014Garner, McBride, Crawford, Brown, Pinnock\u2014they were, tautology intended, people, regardless of the color of their skin. And yet, they weren\u2019t treated as such. In the 21\n century. By the most democratic nation on the planet.\nThe discrepancy is staggering and yet it is an indelible part of the society of the USA, a key component of American history.\nIt is what the American Dream is built upon: dig deep enough below the promises of success and the rags-to-riches Horatio-Alger-like stories, and you\u2019ll find African-American bodies, lifeless, whipped, crunched, chomped, trampled.\nCan you blame black people now for living in a constant state of fear, for \n or for fighting against \n?\nRemembering the violence that surrounded him when he was young, Ta-Nehisi Coates advises his son to \u201cresist the common urge toward the comforting narrative of divine law, toward fairy tales that imply some irrepressible justice.\u201d\nAmerica is, simply put, violent, but it is all African-Americans have. And if they want to change something, they must try to change it actively here on earth, and not allow to be passivized by stories which claim that things will change themselves for the better with time or via some divine intervention after death.\nIt is this, this \u201clanguage of intention,\u201d which makes everything worse.\n\u201cThe point of this language of \u2018intention\u2019 and \u2018personal responsibility\u2019 is broad exoneration,\u201d warns Coates. \u201cMistakes were made. Bodies were broken. People were enslaved. We meant well. We tried our best. \u2018Good intention\u2019 is a hall pass through history, a sleeping pill that ensures the Dream.\u201d\nAs far as Coates is concerned, \n is a corollary of this type of worldview. He prefers the way of \n\u2014just like his father did in the 1970s, eventually becoming a local captain of their Party.\u00a0\nNowadays, Paul Coates works as a research librarian at Howard University, where his son, Ta-Nehisi, by his own admission, finally found himself. Dubbing Howard his Mecca, he talks of how it was there that he learned everything he now knows of race and racial divisions\u2014or, rather, the artificiality of the notions.\n\u201cI was made for the library, not the classroom,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe classroom was a jail of other people\u2019s interests. The library was open, unending, free.\u201d\u00a0\nDuring this time, Ta-Nehisi meets Kenyatta Matthews. At 24, she becomes pregnant with his child. Nine months later the recipient of this letter is born. He is named after Samori Tour\u00e9, a Guinean Muslim cleric who resisted French colonial rule in West Africa between 1882 and 1898 and died in captivity at the turn of the century.\nChapter II\nA month after the birth of Samori, a classmate of Ta-Nehisi and Kenyatta from Howard, Prince Jones, is killed by the Prince George\u2019s County police.\nThe officer, working undercover, had been sent out to track a 5 foot 4, 250-pound drug dealer. However, he eventually shot the 6 foot 3, 211-pound Prince Jones, just yards in front of his fianc\u00e9\u2019s house. There were no witnesses. The charges against him were dropped for no reason whatsoever.\nCoates and his wife went to Howard for their friend\u2019s memorial. At the funeral, Ta-Nehisi couldn\u2019t bear the atmosphere of mercy and forgiveness. After all, the police officer was incompetent and dishonest, and Prince Jones was a deeply religious and kind person.\u00a0\nWhy should anyone forgive the former and not rage in calls for revenge for the death of the latter?\nAfter moving to New York in 2001, two months before September 11, Ta-Nehisi starts feeling anxious and \u201cout of sync with the city.\u201d The reality of this feeling becomes apparent to him on the day of the terrorist attacks.\n\u201cEveryone knew someone who knew someone who was missing,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut looking out upon the ruins of America, my heart was cold. I had disasters all my own. The officer who killed Prince Jones, like all the officers who regard us so warily, was the sword of the American citizenry. I would never consider any American citizen pure.\u201d\nHow could he?\nSouthern Manhattan was \nGround Zero for the Blacks: they had not only been auctioned there but they had also been buried under those very same ruins.\u00a0\n\u201cBin Laden was not the first man to bring terror to that section of the city,\u201d Coates writes to his son. \u201cI never forgot that. Neither should you.\u201d\nEven before he could be aware of it, Samori experienced how deeply engraved racism is within the fabric of American society.\nFor example, once he was manhandled by a white woman at a movie theatre on the Upper West Side. After Coates reprimands her, a white man intervenes. Coates experiences this as \u201chis attempt to rescue the damsel from the beast.\u201d The man had made no such attempt on behalf of his son.\u00a0\nAfter being pushed by Coates, the man said to him something frightening: \u201cI could have you arrested!\u201d Coates thinks he knows what the sentence meant: white people are still in control, and they have all the power they need over his and other black bodies.\u00a0\nJust like they always had.\nThat\u2019s precisely what Coates tells Samori and his cousin during a visit of the historical sites from the Civil War when Samori is ten years old: in the eyes of the African Americans, this wasn\u2019t a noble, heroic endeavor.\nAnd that\u2019s precisely what Samori can experience himself during a visit of a mother of a boy killed by the police: shouldn\u2019t the police be protecting them?\nThey should\u2014but, if you are Black, you better don\u2019t give them a reason to change their minds:\nChapter III\nThe last chapter of Coates\u2019 three-part book-length letter to Samori concerns Ta-Nehisi\u2019s visit of Dr. Mabel Jones, the mother of the murdered Prince Jones.\nWell composed, \u201clovely, polite, brown,\u201d Dr. Mabel Jones was born in Louisiana, which means that she had experienced racism firsthand ever since her earliest years. However, she manages to overcome all obstacles, excelling at school, winning a scholarship to Louisiana State University, and becoming (probably) one of the first black radiologists in American history.\nNoticing his intelligence early on (\u201che was that caliber of a student\u201d), Mabel had hopes that Prince would go to Harvard or another Ivy League School, but chose to go to Howard instead. He just didn\u2019t want to represent to other people anymore: he went to Howard to be normal, and \u201ceven more, to see how broad the black normal really is.\u201d\nCoates asks Mabel if she ever regretted Prince choosing Howard. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, almost hurt. \u201cI regret that he is dead.\u201d Coates follows up this question with another one\u2014if she expected that the police officer who had shot Prince would be charged. She says, \u201cYes.\u201d\nBut he wasn\u2019t\u2014just like so many other police officers who have done and will do the same. Because, no matter how hard the African-Americans try to succeed, the shadow of their race hangs upon their heads like a blade.\nOne racist act is all it takes for a black person to lose his or her personhood.\u00a0\n\u201cThere he was,\u201d Mabel says to Coates, speaking simultaneously of Solomon Northup from \n and her son. \u201cHe had means. He had a family. He was living like a human being. And one racist act took him back. And the same is true of me. I spent years developing a career, acquiring assets, engaging responsibilities. And one racist act. It\u2019s all it takes.\u201d\nCoates leaves with a bitter taste in his mouth. He is devastated that modern technology has allowed the Dreamers to take control of the story behind the Dream and erase the part about how much of it is built upon black bodies.\nAs he is driving home, he watches through the window of his car \n (\u201cthe same ghettos where my mother was raised, where my father was raised\u201d), and the old fear from his childhood overwhelms his body.\nKey Lessons from \u201cBetween the World and Me\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The American Dream Was Built Upon Black Bodies\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bin Laden Wasn\u2019t the First Terrorist in Manhattan \n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Reality of Having a Black Body\nThe American Dream Was Built Upon Black Bodies\nThe American Dream is the national ethos of the United States, what this great country was built upon. However, it is also a nightmare for a large part of America\u2019s population, who was never even considered to be part of the population for most of the country\u2019s history.\nTa-Nehisi Coates is adamant that the only reason why there is such a thing as American Dream is the exclusion of African-Americans from the idea: you can only build something so big and na\u00efve on other people\u2019s backs, and the Blacks have been forced to borrow theirs for centuries.\nBin Laden Wasn\u2019t the First Terrorist in Manhattan\u00a0\nIn one of the most controversial parts of the book\u2014questioned by none other than Michiko Kakutani\u2014Coates says that, while America grieved over the victims of the September 11 attacks, his heart was cold, because he was very much aware that Bin Laden wasn\u2019t the first terrorist to murder Americans in Manhattan.\nJust a century ago, under the very same rubble, African-Americans were either auctioned or murdered by rich white people who are probably still as rich and as white. Manhattan was always the Ground Zero for Blacks.\nThe Reality of Having a Black Body\nAbove everything else, \nreveals that the reality of having a black body today is just a bit less bleak than the reality of having a black body a century ago.\u00a0\nAfrican-Americans are still being killed for no reason by people who are never charged, let alone imprisoned.\nAnd, still, all it takes is just one racist act for an African-American man to lose absolutely everything he has achieved in the blink of an eye.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cBetween the World and Me Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nAccording to A.

And Why?\nDonald Trump doesn\u2019t have a very good opinion for most of USA\u2019s respected journalists, but even he has said some nice words about Bob Woodward in the past. And when we say \u201cin the past,\u201d we do mean \u201cin the past\u201d: he seems to have changed his mind ever since \nwas published.\nSome say it is because the book portrayed him too authentically, others because parts of it are fabricated. If you want to find out, you\u2019ll have to read the book yourself.\nAlso, do read it if you care about America or want to understand what\u2019s happening in the White House. Even the highest echelons in the government are having a hard time disproving some of Woodward\u2019s allegations, and even if half of them are true\u2014it\u2019s a jungle in there, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C.\nAnd not the fun kind.\nAbout Bob Woodward\n is an American investigative journalist.\nHe has worked for \never since 1971 and is currently an associate editor at the newspaper. He started his stellar career with possibly the most famous scoop in the history of American journalism: the Watergate scandal.\nDubbed \u201cmaybe the single greatest reporting effort of all time,\u201d Woodward\u2019s original news reporting on this scandal (with Cal Bernstein) made him an idol of generations of journalists. It later became the material for two of his bestselling books, \nand \n.\nIn addition to these, he has written 17 more books on American politics, such as \n \n and others.\nFind out more at \n.\u00a0\n\u201cFear PDF Summary\u201d\nOn March 31, 2016, at the Old Post Office Pavilion, Trump International Hotel, Washington, D.C., in an interview with Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, then-presidential candidate Donald J. Trump uttered a chilling sentence:\nHence the title of Bob Woodward\u2019s book, published two and a half years later (on September 11, 2018) to widespread acclaim in the liberal media (and general disdain on the other side).\nThe book\nsold over one million copies in the first week of its publication (making it the fastest-selling opener in the history of Simon & Schuster) and is still, one year later, as divisive as it had been even when it was announced that it\u2019s been in the workings.\nTrue, as Woodward explains in a \u201cNote to the Readers\u201d which prefaces the book, \nis not based on conversations with Trump (who declined to be interviewed for the book), but is \u201cdrawn from hundreds of hours of interviews with firsthand participants and witnesses to these events.\u201d\n\u201cNearly all allowed me to tape-record our interviews,\u201d he goes on, \u201cso the story could be told with more precision. When I have attributed exact quotations, thoughts or conclusions to the participants, that information comes from the person, a colleague with direct knowledge, or from meeting notes, personal diaries, files and government or personal documents.\u201d\nEven so, some (White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and Secretary of Defense James Mattis) have denied making the claims attributed to them in the book, and Trump has called its stories \u201cmade up\u201d and said that they have \u201ca lot of credibility issues.\u201d\nBe that as it may, \nwas written by Woodward, and is so frightening it deserves serious consideration.\nAnd here is why.\nMr. Trump\u2019s Aides Do Not Have a Very High Opinion of Him\nWhether you love him or hate him (there\u2019s no middle ground with him, is there?), we think saying that Trump is not the sharpest tool in the shed is a fair \n of his intellectual capabilities.\nThere are people out there who believe that all of that is just a ploy and that Trump knows precisely what he\u2019s doing at all times, but, at least according to \n, even behind the curtains, Trump is what he is in public.\nAnd the people around him can\u2019t believe this!\nHere\u2019s, for example, the summary of a Korea-related meeting (read below about the meeting itself) by an anonymous White House official quoted by Woodward in Chapter 27:\nAnd \u201cextremely concerned\u201d doesn\u2019t even tell half of the story!\nMost of Trump\u2019s advisors, at least as portrayed in the book, are either fed up with him or so frustrated with his opinions and doings they are all but incapable of juggling between their personas anymore.\nFor example, White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly\u2014rumored to be close to resigning for some time now\u2014supposedly once referred to Trump as \u201cunhinged,\u201d and, another time, in a small group meeting in his office, uttered these words about him:\n\u201cHe\u2019s an idiot. It\u2019s pointless to try to convince him of anything. He\u2019s gone off the rails. We\u2019re in crazytown. I don\u2019t even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\nWe wrote \u201csupposedly\u201d above because, at least \n, \u201cit\u2019s exactly the opposite,\u201d and the story is \u201canother pathetic attempt to smear people close to President Trump and distract from the administration\u2019s many successes.\nJohn Kelly may have retracted his statement (Woodward still claims that it is both accurate and verifiable), Rex Tillerson has yet to say something similar. And his description of Trump is even more damning.\nNamed Secretary of State by Trump in December 2016, Tillerson regularly clashed with the President, something which culminated on March 13, 2018, when he was fired from his office.\nBut there\u2019s a good chance he was already thinking about resigning long before.\u00a0\nAfter a meeting during which Trump suggested to the US military a tenfold increase of the United States nuclear arsenal\u2014something that would cost a lot of money and take hundreds of years to complete\u2014in a discussion with Priebus, Tillerson called Trump a \u201cmoron.\u201d\n\u201cI just don\u2019t like the way the president talks to these generals,\u201d he supposedly said. They don\u2019t deserve it. I can\u2019t sit around and listen to this from the president. He\u2019s just a moron.\u201d\n\u201cIt was challenging for me coming from the disciplined, highly process-oriented Exxon Mobil corporation,\u201d Tillerson would say to Bob Schieffer in an interview after leaving the Trump administration, \u201cto go to work for a man who is pretty undisciplined, doesn\u2019t like to read, doesn\u2019t read briefing reports, doesn\u2019t like to get into the details of a lot of things, but rather just kind of says, \u2018This is what I believe.\u2019\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s not just Tillerson\u2019s assessment.\nThink it\u2019s easy talking to Trump?\nNot according to his associates: it\u2019s basically the same discussion over and over again! Because Trump just doesn\u2019t listen to anyone but himself. You know\u2026 like children.\n\u201cGrievance was a big part of Trump\u2019s core,\u201d writes Woodward in Chapter 36, \u201cvery much like a 14-year-old boy who felt he was being picked on unfairly. You couldn\u2019t talk to him in adult logic. Teenage logic was necessary.\u201d\nSupposedly, Secretary of Defense James Mattis is particularly exasperated and alarmed by this trait of the President, telling close associates that Trump acts like (and has the understanding of) \u201ca fifth or sixth-grader.\u201d\nSpeaking of which\u2026\nTrump and His Tweets\nTrump may not be a dedicated reader, but he\u2019s certainly a great consumer and lover of all forms of media.\n\u201cDuring Trump\u2019s first six months in the White House, few understood how much media he consumed,\u201d writes Woodward. \u201cIt was scary,\u201d he adds. Trump didn\u2019t show up for work until 11:00 in the morning. Many times he watched six to eight hours of television in a day.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s not all, of course. He also tweets about it\u2014and, as you know full well, about everything else.\nThe tweets, says Woodward, are not merely incidental to his presidency. They are central.\nHow central, you ask?\nWell, Trump once ordered printouts of all of his recent tweets that had received a high number of likes, north of 200,000.\nWhy, you ask?\nWell, to study them and find the common thread, to discover the themes that make him popular. \u201cHe seemed to want to become more strategic,\u201d writes Woodward, \u201cfind out whether success was tied to the subject, the language or simply the surprise that the president was weighing in.\u201d\u00a0\nUnsurprisingly, it turned out that \u201cthe most effective tweets were often the most shocking.\u201d\nSo, Trump went about his business: shocking everybody via his tweets day in day out, despite suggestions to the opposite by his social media director Dan Scavino and his PR specialist Hope Hicks.\nIn fact, after Trump described Mika Brzezinski, in a scathing 6 a.m., as \u201cbleeding badly from a face-lift\u201d\u2014enraging many women senators\u2014Hicks, Scavino and other top staffers tried setting up a committee with a mission to vet Trump\u2019s \u201cpolitically unhelpful\u201d tweets.\nHowever, Trump ignored them, because, in his opinion, it is the other way around, Twitter being the reason why he won the election in the first place.\nHe supposedly said to them:\nUnsurprisingly for a man with such a mindset, he honestly believes that he\u2019s also a great composer of tweets. When Tweeter announced doubling the number of permissible characters to 280, Trump supposedly said that though this was pretty nice on one level because it allowed for more depth, it\u2019s also bad on another.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he is quoted as saying by Woodward, \u201cbut it\u2019s a bit of a shame because I was the Ernest Hemingway of 140 characters.\u201d\nStealing Important Documents Under Trump\u2019s Nose (and Saving Two Trade Deals)\nNo matter what you think about Trump, you can\u2019t deny the fact that he tries hard to be true to his promise to put America first.\u00a0\nThe problem is that, most of the time, experts are not so sure that his attempts to do this could result in the desired outcome. In fact, it\u2019s usually quite the opposite.\nWhile editing a speech with White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter soon after leaving a G20 summit\u2014according to Woodward\u2014Trump scribbled three revealing words on a piece of paper which probably sum up most of his beliefs regarding his job: \u201cTrade is bad.\u201d\n\u201cThough he never said it in a speech,\u201d Woodward writes, \u201che had finally found the summarizing phrase and truest expression of his protectionism, isolationism and fervent American nationalism.\u201d\nIn reality, however, the world doesn\u2019t work this way. In reality, trading \u201cglobalism\u201d for \u201cnationalism\u201d does damage in the long run for everybody, even if it seems beneficial for the trader in the short run.\nHowever, Donald \u201cthis-is-what-I-believe\u201d Trump wouldn\u2019t have any of it. His politics, according to Woodward, is actually economics and quite a simple one: trade surplus = good, trade deficit = bad.\nAnd he would do everything to transform the latter in the former, disregarding possible negative outcomes.\nCase in point, two years ago, Trump nearly pulled the United States out of two major trade deals: NAFTA and KORUS.\nAllegedly, in the spring of 2017, Trump had Rob Porter draft an order to remove the US from NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada, and Mexico), a trilateral trade bloc which is one of the largest in the world by GDP.\nGary Cohn, a Goldman Sachs COO and the chief economic advisor to Trump from 2017 to 2018, and Sonny Perdue, the secretary of agriculture, tried explaining to Trump that this is not a smart thing, since the three economies are tightly integrated, and the US exports $39 billion surplus of products to Mexico and Canada every year.\nBut Trump doesn\u2019t want explanations: it\u2019s either his way or the highway!\nUnless\u2026\n\u201cI can stop this,\u201d Cohn said to Porter after realizing that Trump is planning to go all the way with his plan. \u201cI\u2019ll just take the paper off his desk before I leave.\u201d And he later took it. \u201cIf he\u2019s going to sign it, he\u2019s going to need another piece of paper,\u201d he said.\nSomething similar happened in the case of KORUS, the United States\u2013Korea Free Trade Agreement, which eliminates about 95% of each nation\u2019s tariffs on goods and sets the rules for more than $150-billion-worth of trades, involving over 350 million consumers in both countries.\u00a0\nCohn tried explaining to Trump that it is due to KORUS that Americans are able to buy \u201cthe most amazing TVs in the world for $245,\u201d which is the reason why \u201cpeople are spending less money on TVs and more money on other products in the United States,\u201d but he used graphs and to do that, and Trump, as noted above, doesn\u2019t understand graphs.\nWhat he does understand, however, is his logic of a teenager, according to which everyone can be wrong but him.\nAccording to Woodward, Trump even signed a letter that would have taken the USA out of KORUS, but, thankfully, Cohn stole it off Trump\u2019s desk.\nThe President never noticed it was missing.\nThe Koreas: \u201cWe\u2019re Doing This in Order to Prevent World War III\u201d\nThere is, of course, another aspect of the KORUS agreement that Trump is not that bothered about and that keeps all of his military officers awake at night.\nNamely, the US is paying $1 billion a year for an anti-ballistic missile system in South Korea called the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) which is there for two reasons: 1) to protect South Korea and its free-market society from an attack by its communist neighbor on the north, and 2) to protect the USA from a nuclear attack by North Korea.\nHow so?\nWell, the THAAD should detect a missile fired in the direction of the United States in the span of seven seconds if in South Korea, much, much longer than the 15 minutes necessary if the THAAD was located in Alaska.\nHowever, Trump was pretty adamant that the South Koreans are supposed to pay for the THAAD, and that the United States should immediately get rid of its troops in that country.\n\u201cWe spend $3.5 billion a year to have troops in South Korea,\u201d Trump said once angrily to Cohn. \u201c$3.5 billion, 28,000 troops\u2026 I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re there. Let\u2019s bring them all home!\u201d\nHe thought pretty much the same about THAAD as well, asking that it be relocated to Portland, Oregon. \u201cI informed South Korea it would be appropriate if they paid,\u201d he once said. \u201cIt\u2019s a billion-dollar system. It\u2019s phenomenal, shoots missiles right out of the sky.\u201d\nThe root cause for all of this?\nThe American $18 billion trade deficit with South Korea!\nAmazed at how little Trump cares about world peace, Mattis once said to him something described by Woodward as \u201ca breathtaking statement, a challenge to the president:\u201d \u201c\u201cWe\u2019re doing this in order to prevent World War III.\u201d\nStill, as in the case of so many other deals, Trump thought that all of that is just an excuse and that Americans are being played like \u201csuckers\u201d by their former enemies, who\u00a0\n\u201cI think we could be so rich,\u201d Trump said once, \u201cif we weren\u2019t stupid.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cFear\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The President Doesn\u2019t Command Presidential Respect from His (Former) Aides\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Trump\u2019s Position on Everything: \u201cDeny, Deny, Deny\u201d\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Trump Is Not Fit to Properly Lead USA\u2019s Military\nThe President Doesn\u2019t Command Presidential Respect from His (Former) Aides\nJudging by Woodward\u2019s \n, something\u2019s really rotten in the state of America, since not many of Trump\u2019s associates can bear spending time or having a discussion with him.\nBlame it on his teenage logic!\nAccording to James Mattis, Trump has the mind of \u201ca fifth or sixth-grader,\u201d and according to Rex Tillerson, he\u2019s nothing short of a \u201cmoron.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s pointless to try to convince him of anything,\u201d supposedly said John F. Kelly, claiming that Trump has \u201cgone off the rails.\u201d\nJohn M. Dowd, then-Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, said something in the same vein in the light of the Mueller investigation, advising him to either not testify or end up with \u201can orange jump suit.\u201d\nAll of the above with the exception of Kelly are not part of Trump\u2019s administration anymore. It makes you wonder, doesn\u2019t it?\nTrump\u2019s Position on Everything: \u201cDeny, Deny, Deny\u201d\nThe first rule of talking to Trump: Trump is never wrong.\nThe second rule of talking to him: when he is (which happens frequently) he\u2019d deny everything \n.\u00a0\nAnd he doesn\u2019t even care how negative the thing in question is.\nOnce, talking to a friend who had made the mistake of acknowledging \u201csome bad behavior toward women,\u201d Trump advised him to never forget that \u201creal power is fear,\u201d and that one is always supposed to be strong:\nYou know, just like he does on about everything\u2014even when the records show the opposite.\nTrump Only Cares About Trade Deficits and Is Not Fit to Properly Lead USA\u2019s Military\nTrump once implied to Mattis that he\u2019d sleep like a baby even if North Korea attacks South Korea if he manages to transform the trade deficit toward South Korea in a trade surplus.\nOnly the theft by Gary Kohn of two already signed documents prevented him from ruining 2 massive trade deals (NAFTA and KORUS)\u2014at least for now\u2014and causing tensions on both the Korean peninsula and across the North American continent.\nIn addition, he supposedly once told Mattis in a telephone call to kill Syrian president, Bashar al-Asaad\u2014just like that, as if it is a video game. And if that\u2019s not enough, reportedly, Trump once asked Johnny McEntee, his \u201c27-year-old body man,\u201d if he should send more troops to Afghanistan.\u00a0\nWe\u2019re not even going to mention the tweeter war he had with North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un over the size of each other\u2019s nuclear buttons.

And Why?\nis the book everyone who believes that the modern-day US-based version of Themis wears a blindfold should read straight away. Especially if he/she is a lawyer or judge.\nIt is also a book for those who know that America\u2019s criminal justice system is flawed. Read it to not only see the extent of its unjust nature but also to detect the root cause.\nAbout Bryan Stevenson\n is an American lawyer, social activist, and bestselling author.\nA clinical professor at New York University School of Law, Stevenson is also the founder and executive director of Equal Justice Initiative, a non-profit organization which provides legal representation to marginalized prisoners who may have been wrongly convicted.\nWidely considered \u201cone of the most brilliant and influential lawyers of our time,\u201d Stevenson has received over 40 honorary doctoral degrees and won numerous awards, including the prestigious MacArthur Foundation \u201cGenius\u201d Prize, and the ABA Medal, the American Bar Association\u2019s highest honor.\nFind out more at \n.\u00a0\n\u201cJust Mercy PDF Summary\u201d\nRecently adapted into a touching and critically acclaimed legal drama starring Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx, \n,\nfor the most part of it, tells the story of Walter McMillian, a wrongfully convicted African-American pulpwood worker, whose controversial case received nationwide attention thanks to the efforts of none other than Bryan Stevenson.\nHowever, though McMillian\u2019s story is certainly its backbone, \n the book offers much more than the movie of the same name. It not only contains profiles of many other similar cases, but it also highlights the serious faults of the American justice system and suggests how they can be mended.\nIn a way, it is a very unique coming-of-age story which follows, across more than two decades, the fight of an idealistic and gifted young lawyer against the Leviathan that is the American legal system, still deeply rooted in bias and prejudice, still favoring the wealthy and the powerful over the poor and the helpless.\nThere is a way out, suggests Stevenson, offering a ray of hope for those of us who\u2019ve lost it\u2014and, believe it or not, it\u2019s both rational and humane one.\nRead ahead to find out more about it!\nBryan Stevenson, a Real-Life Modern-Day Atticus Finch\nIf you have an HBO subscription, allow us to make a recommendation: watch the documentary \nas soon as possible.\u00a0\nAs the movie\u2019s subtitle says, it is a biography of Bryan Stevenson and it documents his decade-long fight for equality. As such, it makes \neven more intelligible and emotional.\nIn short, Stevenson was born to an underprivileged black family in \u201cpoor, rural, racially segregated settlement on the eastern shore of the Delmarva Peninsula, in Delaware.\u201d Though this was just a little more than half a century ago, it was Delaware, and Stevenson had to deal with racism ever since his earliest years.\nHe studied at a \u201ccolored\u201d elementary school and his life didn\u2019t get better even after the formal desegregation: black children continued to play separated from white children, and they had to wait at the backdoor at the doctor\u2019s or the dentist\u2019s office!\nUnsurprisingly, Stevenson grew up wondering how just it is for black and poor children to be treated as second-rate citizens: if anything, it should be the other way around, because they were powerless and they \n help.\nBut he was never one of those who favored revenge over redemption\u2014and he didn\u2019t change this stance even after his maternal grandfather was stabbed to death when he was sixteen.\nAfter graduating from Eastern University in St. Davids, Pennsylvania, Stevenson received a full scholarship to attend Harvard Law School, but his real career began while interning with the Southern Prisoners Defense Committee (SPDC).\nOver the course of this internship, Stevenson has the privilege of meeting and befriending Henry, a young black man with a wife and kids, Bryan\u2019s very first death row inmate acquaintance.\u00a0\nThe encounter has a transformative effect on Stevenson: he realizes that what he wants to do in life is to fight \n the death penalty and \n the reformation of America\u2019s cruel and unjust prison system.\nSo as to achieve this, he moves to Atlanta to work for the SPDC. After some time, he moves yet again to Montgomery, Alabama, where, in 1989, he founded the Equal Justice Initiative\u2014or EJI for short\u2014an organization with a mission to \u201cguarantee legal representation to every inmate on the state\u2019s death row.\u201d\nNumbers Don\u2019t Lie: The New Jim Crow\nA year or so after moving to Atlanta, Stevenson was able to find (and afford) an apartment of his own. Since it was on a dense residential street, some nights he had to park halfway down the block (or even around the corner) to find a space.\nHowever, one night, he got lucky and found a space just steps from his new front door. To make things even better, the radio was playing one of his favorite songs: \u201cHot Fun in the Summertime\u201d by Sly and the Family Stone.\nBryan relaxed and decided to remain in the car for a couple of minutes and enjoy listening to the music. Not exactly, the perfect setting for the horror that followed: before Stevenson knew it, a SWAT team had surrounded his car, pointing guns at him and blaming him for a burglary.\nThey never apologized after letting him go. \u201cYou should be happy,\u201d the older officer said to him, frowning.\u00a0\nBelieve it or not, the officer was right: Bryan was pretty fortunate \n to be imprisoned for, well, doing nothing \n being black. Because, as Michelle Alexander demonstrates in her exceptional and aptly-titled book, \n, most African-Americans usually \nand in quite similar situations\nAnd this is not an exaggeration: based on the stats, 1 in 3 African-Americans born in the 21\n century will end up at least once in prison during his life!\nNow, how is that possible?\nWell, two reasons, and they can be summed up in three words: drugs, Reagan, and jurors.\nYou see, mass incarceration is a relatively new phenomenon, and it really hit off after \n. During and after his time, prison\u2019s population rose significantly, mostly because of all the black people put there for smoking marijuana or something similar.\nThough, statistically, white people use drugs at much the same rate, it was mainly the African-Americans who ended up being imprisoned because the jurors were (and still are) mostly white men\u2014even in counties with majority black populations.\nWhy are so few black people jurors even though ever since 1880 it is unconstitutional to exclude jurors on the basis of race?\nWell, because most of them have been convicted of some minor crime and, thus, are more often than not ineligible!\nIt\u2019s a vicious circle and it spells out Injustice with a capital I!\nThe Story of Walter McMillian\ncontains numerous stories of wrongfully or harshly convicted people from all walks of life.\nOn its pages, you\u2019ll come across a young mother serving a decade-long prison sentence for writing five checks\u2014none more than $150\u2014or across Charlie, a 14-year-old boy sentenced to life in prison for killing his mother\u2019s abusive boyfriend.\nHowever, by far the longest and most important story is that of Walter McMillian which is so fraught with the failings of the justice system that it almost reads like an allegory.\nUnfortunately, it is a true story and yet another one about wrongfully convicted African-American man coming from a poor community in Monroeville, Alabama.\nThough he had spent most of his childhood picking cotton, Walter managed to become a \u201cmoderately successful businessman\u201d by the time he was 45. By this time, he was also a married man with children.\u00a0\nHowever, in the community, he was best-known for the affair he had with Karen Kelly, a white woman, and for the fact that his son had married a white woman as well.\nAnd then, on November 1, 1986, a beloved 18-year-old white dry-cleaning clerk by the name of Ronda Morrison was shot numerous times from behind by an unknown assailant.\nAt the time, Walter McMillian was at a church fish fry, but this didn\u2019t matter to the newly elected and openly racist Sheriff Tom Tate, after Ralph Myers\u2014an illiterate and mentally unstable friend of Karen Kelly\u2014arbitrarily implicated McMillian (Karen\u2019s \u201cblack boyfriend\u201d) in this and another murder.\nEven though it was obvious that \u201cWalter McMillian had never met Ralph Myers, let alone committed two murders with him,\u201d about half a year after the murder of Ronda Morrison, McMillian was arrested by Sheriff Tom Tate.\n\u201cThere was no evidence against McMillian,\u201d reminds us Stevenson, \u201cno evidence except that he was an African American man involved in an adulterous interracial affair, which meant he was reckless and possibly dangerous, even if he had no prior criminal history and a good reputation. Maybe that was evidence enough.\u201d\nWell, even if that was evidence enough as far as the Sheriff was concerned, judges usually want a bit more to send a man to the death sentence.\nWell, Tom Tate, the District Attorney, and several investigators took care of that: they bribed witnesses, they forced Ralph Myers to testify that McMillian was the murderer even after he had tried to recant, and systematically ignored evidence in favor of Walter.\nThere were many witnesses (all of them black) who swore, under oath, that at the time of the murder, McMillian was at the church fish fry, but an almost all-white jury (there was only one African American member) pronounced McMillian guilty and recommended a life sentence after a day and a half sham trial.\nWhy only that, said Judge Robert E. Lee Key, using the \u201cunique Alabama practice\u201d called \u201cJudge Overrule\u201d to override the jury and impose the death penalty.\nAfter all\u2014and this is where things get extraordinarily Kafkaesque\u2014Walter McMillian had already been sent by the Judge to await trial on death row, even before the defense could present its case!\nHow do we know all of the above?\nBecause Bryan Stevenson and his newly-founded Equal Justice Initiative took on the case and started finding all kinds of dirt connected to it after Ralph Myers revealed to the McMillian\u2019s trial counsel that he had given false testimony against Walter.\nThat was merely the beginning of the investigation. It would take years for Myers to officially recant the testimony, and the EJI to discover proofs of the bribery methods used by the State to convict Walter and the ways in which their racially motivated hatred had messed with the evidence.\nAfter the case gained nationwide attention as part of the CBS program \n, new DA Tom Chapman launched his own investigation which confirmed EJI claims regarding Walter\u2019s innocence.\nBecause of this, the EJI was in a good position to move for the state to drop all charges against McMillian and, after six years on the death row, Walter McMillian was finally released.\nHowever, by this time, Walter had already changed and, despite the efforts of EJI to help him reenter society, he developed dementia and anxiety probably brought on to him by the trauma of imprisonment.\nWalter McMillian died in 2013, on September 11.\nThe Quality of Mercy: \u201cAbove This Sceptred Sway\u201d\nAt Walter\u2019s funeral, Bryan Stevenson was one of the people asked to give a speech to the congregation.\u00a0\n\u201cI felt the need to explain to people what Walter had taught me,\u201d informs us Stevenson in \nand goes on to list, so poignantly and so clearly, not all the things he said at Walter\u2019s funeral, but, coincidentally, all the \nbehind his book:\nWalter had thought Bryan something even more beautiful and enduring: the quality of mercy.\u00a0\n\u201cMercy is just when it is rooted in hopefulness and freely given,\u201d writes Stevenson memorably, not only channeling but transcending his inner Portia. \u201cMercy is most empowering, liberating, and transformative when it is directed at the undeserving. The people who haven\u2019t earned it, who haven\u2019t even sought it, are the most meaningful recipients of our compassion.\u201d\nRemember that: just mercy belongs to the undeserving.\nAnd it is the only thing strong enough to \u201cbreak the cycle of victimization and victimhood, retribution and suffering. It has the power to heal the psychic harm and injuries that lead to aggression and violence, abuse of power, mass incarceration.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cJust Mercy\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Biased) Mass Incarceration Is a Serious (American) Problem\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Justice Is the Antonym of Poverty\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Each of Us is More Than the Worst Thing We\u2019ve Ever Done\n(Biased) Mass Incarceration Is a Serious (American) Problem\nAt present, there are 2.3 million people imprisoned in the USA, and thrice than that (about six million) on probation or on parole. That makes for a staggering number of more than 8 million criminals living on US soil, which basically means that if you know more than 40 people, you definitely know at least one criminal.\nHow does that compare to other countries?\nReally, really bad!\nWith 737 prisoners per 100,000 people, the USA tops the prison rates charts, housing almost a million more prisoners than China, even though China\u2019s population is about four times that of the US.\nWhat\u2019s worse and statistically improbable, a lot of these prisoners are African-Americans!\n\u201cOne in every fifteen people born in the United States in 2001 is expected to go to jail or prison,\u201d informs us Stevenson, \u201cone in every three black male babies born in this century is expected to be incarcerated.\u201d\nJustice Is the Antonym of Poverty\nAnd you know why there are so many imprisoned Americans, especially black?\nBecause most of them are marginalized in at least one other way, being either too poor or too young to find someone to defend them.\nStevenson writes:\nEach of us is more than the worst thing we\u2019ve ever done\u00a0\nIf you need to remember one thing from Bryan Stevenson\u2019s excellent book, remember this: \u201cEach of us is more than the worst thing we\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the vital lesson he learned working closely with death row inmates, most of them marginalized and frozen out from society.\nInstead of punishing them twice, Stevenson argues, we need to offer them a second chance.\n\u201cSimply punishing the broken\u2014walking away from them or hiding them from sight\u2014only ensures that they remain broken and we do, too,\u201d he concludes. \u201cThere is no wholeness outside of our reciprocal humanity.\u201d\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cJust Mercy Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\n\u201cNot since Atticus Finch has a fearless and committed lawyer made such a difference in the American South,\u201d writes everyone\u2019s favorite author of legal thrillers, \n, reviewing \n.\u00a0\n\u201cThough larger than life,\u201d he goes on, \u201c\n.

If you want to succeed in this wicked modern world of ours, he says, you need to have something much more than a certain specialty.\nYou need to have:\nWho Should Read \u201cRange\u201d? And Why?\nOn the face of it, the time of polymaths is long gone: there are very few Da Vincis, Michelangelos, and Galileos around, and even fewer of them command the same respect these people did back in their own days.\nHowever, the author of \n, David Epstein, believes the opposite: the ones who succeed are actually the ones who\u2019ve refused to specialize and are able to see things from a broader perspective.\nRegardless of what you think, read Epstein\u2019s \nand face his arguments. Especially if you are young and/or clueless as to what your next career move should be. Perhaps, Epstein would argue, you\u2019ve already made your life far easier\u2014precisely by procrastinating and dabbling around.\nCommenting upon this, Amanda Ripley, author of \n,\nadds a few further recommendations:\u00a0\n\u201cI want to give \nto any kid who is being forced to take violin lessons\u2014but really wants to learn the drums; to any programmer who secretly dreams of becoming a psychologist; to everyone who wants humans to thrive in an age of robots.\u201d\u00a0\nAbout David Epstein\n is a bestselling American author.\nEpstein graduated from Columbia University in environmental science and astronomy and earned master\u2019s degrees from the same university in both environmental science and journalism.\nBefore working as an investigative reporter at ProPublica, Epstein was a senior writer at \n, where he co-authored (with Selena Roberts) the story which first broke to the public that Alex Rodriguez tested positive for steroids in 2003.\nIn addition to \n, he is also the author of \n.\u00a0\nFind out more at \n.\u00a0\n\u201cRange PDF Summary\u201d\nEven if you don\u2019t know a lot about Malcolm Gladwell, you\u2019ve probably already heard a lot about one concept he made quite popular in his third book, \n: the \u201c10,000-Hour Rule.\u201d\nThe basic idea behind it is quite simple: if you want to become an expert in something, you need about 10,000 hours of \u201cdeliberate practice.\u201d\nThat\u2019s how the Beatles became the Beatles, how Bill Gates became a computer whizz \n.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how old you are: what matters is the number of hours you have put into the discipline you want to excel at!\u00a0\nMozart, for example, started playing the piano from a very early age, and that is the main reason why he was considered a prodigy at the age of 6. In reality, however, by that age, he had already played the piano as many hours as most professionals manage well in their 20s, so, \n, he was much older than he actually was.\nAccording to David Epstein, however, this is not the smartest way to go through life nowadays. Though he too believes that getting a head start and specializing in something works from time to time, most of the time, he says, it actually has \n effects.\nAnd, believe it or not, Malcolm Gladwell (of all people) seems to agree!\n\u201cFor reasons I cannot explain,\u201d he says, \u201cDavid Epstein manages to make me thoroughly enjoy the experience of being told that everything I thought about something was wrong.\nYup, it\u2019s time we make you question your old belief system once again, via the highlights from David Epstein\u2019s marvelous \n!\nA Story of Two Exceptional Boys\nJust like Epstein, we\u2019ll start our text with a couple of stories from the world of sports. It\u2019s quite possible that you know them both\u2014the first one much more than the second one.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention list \u201ckicks a ball\u201d and \u201cstands on tiptoe\u201d as physical developmental milestones for a 2-year-old child.\nHowever, the child from our first story, at that very same age, was already able to use \u201ca club tall enough to reach his shoulder to drive a ball past an admiring Bob Hope\u201d on national TV! That same year, he entered his first tournament and won against children much older than him.\nThe very next year, this boy was capable of playing out of a \u201csand trap\u201d and already boasted a score that many people (including the writer of this article) can only dream of: 48, 11 over par, for 9 holes at a course in California.\nOnly a few years later (at the age of 8), the boy beat his father for the first time, even though his father had been an outstanding athlete himself, playing baseball in college as the only black player in the entire conference.\nThe father didn\u2019t mind: he was already aware that his son was \u201cthe Chosen One.\u201d Not only he did have the talent, but he also had the father to guide him toward greatness.\nThe second story concerns a very different kind of boy.\u00a0\nThis one\u2019s mother was a coach, but she never coached him. In fact, for all intents and purposes, he had a pretty regular childhood, playing everything from basketball and handball to soccer and table tennis. He also dabbled in skiing, swimming, wrestling, and skateboarding.\nOne day he discovered that he liked more sports that included a ball, and, nearing his teens, he started gravitating toward one particular kind of sport played with a ball: tennis. He still liked playing soccer, though, and by the time he had given up that sport as well, most of the other kids at his age had long since been working with strength coaches, sports psychologists, and nutritionists.\nIt didn\u2019t matter in the long run: just like the kid from the first story, he too became the greatest.\nIn 2006, the boys whose stories we related to you above met for the first time and immediately connected. \u201cI\u2019ve never spoken with anybody who was so familiar with the feeling of being invincible,\u201d boy #2 would later describe this encounter.\u00a0\nHowever, he was aware of the differences between the two as well.\n\u201cHis story is completely different from mine,\u201d he added later on for a biographer. \u201cEven as a kid, his goal was to break the record for winning the most majors. I was just dreaming of just once meeting Boris Becker or being able to play at Wimbledon some time.\u201d\nAnd, indeed\u2014though the success of Boy #2 was all but inevitable considering his upbringing, it seems pretty unusual that Boy #2 was at least as dominant in his sport at the time of this meeting as Boy #1.\nHow did he do it? Was it against the odds? Or there\u2019s something more to it?\nTiger vs Roger, aka Specialists vs Generalists\nBy now, you almost certainly know the identities of the two exceptional boys from the section above: Tiger Woods and Roger Federer.\u00a0\nFor David Epstein, they are much more than just household names, much more than dominant sportsmen, much more than the most dominant athletes of the 20\n century. Namely, they are symbols, real-life embodiments of two very different philosophies of life and two very different approaches toward education.\nTiger Woods is, of course, the Archetypal Specialist, the undeniable proof of the veracity of Gladwell\u2019s 10,000-hours rule. He has \u201ccome to symbolize the idea that the quantity of deliberate practice determines success\u2014and its corollary, that the practice must start as early as possible.\u201d\nRoger Federer, on the other hand, is the Typical Generalist. He chose to focus on tennis only after he was well into his teens. Unlike Tiger, thousands of kids had a head start on Roger, but, for some reason, none of them managed to become the #1 tennis player in the world.\nNo one would blame you for thinking that Roger\u2019s story is the exception, but, believe it or not, it is Tiger\u2019s! As Epstein writes:\nFor example, if you are a sports fan, you certainly know the name of Vasyl Lomachenko (the current #1 pound-for-pound boxer in the world), but did you know that he took four years off boxing as a kid to learn traditional Ukrainian dance?\nWhat about Ester Ledeck\u00e1, the first woman ever to win gold in two different sports (skiing and snowboarding) at the same Winter Olympics?\u00a0\nWhat about LeBron James, Tom Brady or Nick Foles\u2014all of them exceptionally successful in at least one other sport?\nFinally, what about the entire German national soccer team which won the World Cup in 2014? As a team of scientists demonstrated, it almost exclusively comprised late specializers who didn\u2019t play more organized soccer than amateur-league players until age twenty-two or later!\nWhat\u2019s the catch? And does it apply outside sports as well?\u00a0\nKlein vs Kahneman, aka Experience vs Performance\nTo answer these questions, maybe we should turn to the findings of Gary Klein and \n, two pioneers in the study of human decision making.\nBoth of them had spent years studying the connection between experience and performance, but, strangely enough, they had reached quite different conclusions.\nKlein studied firefighting and naval commandeers and realized that between 80 and 95 percent of their decisions are made \u201cinstinctively and in seconds,\u201d or, to use the title of another Malcolm Gladwell book, \n.\u00a0\nHis investigations discovered why and how this happens: whether firefighters or naval commanders, these people are experienced enough to recognize repeating patterns and, thus, capable, to choose a common course of action\u2014usually the first one to come to mind.\nSo, something like chess players. \u201cI see a move, a combination, almost instantly,\u201d said Garry Kasparov, arguably the greatest chess player in history, to the author of this book, betting that most grandmasters \u201cusually make the move that springs to mind in the first few seconds of thought.\u201d\nDaniel Kahneman, however, discovered something far more peculiar than this. Working as a young lieutenant in the psychology unit of the Israel Defense Forces, he noticed that neither he nor his colleagues were able to guess correctly assess an officer candidate, no matter how many times they tried.\nEven after years of assessing, they were still barely better than an average human blind guessing. The experience didn\u2019t make them any better than beginners; there was a \u201ccomplete lack of connection between the statistical information and the compelling experience of insight.\u201d\nSo, who was right: Klein or Kahneman? Does experience inevitably make one better in his field or does it have no effect after a certain point?\nKind vs Wicked Learning Environments\nThe answer to both of the questions posited above is \n.\nAnd we discovered this because a decade ago, in 2009, Kahneman and Klein decided to collaborate on a paper and find common ground.\u00a0\nAnd they did find it, agreeing that:\u00a0\nAnd the reason for that?\nThe learning environment inherent to the field in question!\u00a0\nIn essence, specialists get better with experience only in learning environments where \u201cpatterns repeat over and over, and feedback is extremely accurate and usually very rapid.\u201d These (after Robin Hogarth) are called \u201ckind working environments\u201d and are perfect for trial-and-error \u201cdeliberate\u201d learners.\nThink of golf or chess or playing the guitar or programming. When you make a mistake, in all of these disciplines, you know that you\u2019ve made a mistake, and you try to correct it on your second attempt. Repeat this for years and you\u2019re bound to become an expert.\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t work as well in the so-called \u201cwicked learning environments,\u201d where \u201cthe rules of the game are often unclear or incomplete, there may or may not be repetitive patterns and they may not be obvious, and feedback is often delayed, inaccurate, or both.\u201d\nThink of the arts now, or of political trends or of doctors. How do you know if a verse is good or not, or whether you\u2019ve made the right prediction? Even better, \ndo you realize your mistake? Are there patterns in accordance to which you can correct it easily?\nA Brief Manual for Becoming a Generalist\nAll of the above are, of course, rhetorical questions, and they all form the basis of David Epstein\u2019s main argument.\u00a0\nNamely, that specialization is all but outdated, because it mostly works in fields where humans will probably be replaced by robots in the near future.\u00a0\u00a0\nA much better way to achieve something in the world of tomorrow is by allowing yourself to become a Jack-of-all-trades before you naturally start investing your time and attention into one particular discipline.\u00a0\nDavid Epstein\u2019s main bits of advice to help you on this journey are the following ones:\nSample everything from math and physics to dancing and playing the guitar! The disorderly path of experimentation pays off in the long run.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not a coincidence that Nobel laureates in science are 22 times more likely to have artistic pursuits outside their field than their less-recognized peers!\nAs Epstein says, \u201cexperimentation is not a tidy prescription, but it is common, and it has advantages, and it requires more than the typical motivational-poster lip service to a tolerance for failure. Breakthroughs are high variance.\u201d\nSo, test and try out new and different things, constantly creating, manufacturing, and generating artifacts. The more work you produce, the higher the chances you\u2019ll churn out a dud, but also the higher the chances of a supernova success!\nTwo letters make so much difference, don\u2019t they?\nUsually people advise other people to not \n behind, but Epstein says quite the opposite: don\u2019t \n behind no matter where you are in your life.\nDon\u2019t be Julius Caesar who broke down in tears upon seeing a statue of Alexander the Great when he was a young man. \u201cAlexander at my age had conquered so many nations, and I have all this time done nothing that is memorable,\u201d he supposedly said.\u00a0\nPretty soon, he ruled an empire even greater than that of Alexander and this concern was a distant memory.\n\u201cCompare yourself to yourself yesterday,\u201d suggests Epstein, \u201cnot to younger people who aren\u2019t you. Everyone progresses at a different rate, so don\u2019t let anyone else make you feel behind. You probably don\u2019t even know where exactly you\u2019re going, so feeling behind doesn\u2019t help.\u201d\nThough head starts are overrated and \u201cmental meandering and personal experimentation\u201d are exceptional sources of power, don\u2019t forget that there is nothing inherently wrong with specialization.\nAnd don\u2019t forget to start specializing in some area, at some point or the other, to one degree or another.\u00a0\nWe all do it, after all.\nKey Lessons from \u201cRange\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Tiger the Specialist vs Roger the Generalist\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Kind vs Wicked Learning Environments\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 How and Why to Become a Generalist\nTiger the Specialist vs Roger the Generalist\nWhen it comes to mastering a certain sphere, there are two kinds of people in this world: Tigers and Rogers.\nThe first ones are very much like Tiger Woods: they are guided from a very early age toward a certain type of success, and through thousands of hours of deliberate practice, they inevitably achieve it.\nThe latter ones are not unlike Roger Federer: they take up a certain profession late in their lives after spending years dabbling between many different professions. However, they too achieve immense success eventually.\nInterestingly, David Epstein argues, the Rogers are much more common than the Tigers\u2014and, no matter what all those books say, in many cases, the head start doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0\nKind vs Wicked Learning Environments\nThe reason why a head start matters in golf is that the game offers a kind learning environment. In other words, it is repetitive and the feedback is extremely accurate. Hit it this hard and the ball doesn\u2019t reach the hole; consequently, you should hit the ball with less force the next time.\nThis, however, doesn\u2019t work if you are a surgeon, a psychologist, or a poet. There are no discernible repetitive patterns, and the feedback is slow. Practice and experience help little in these cases. Because these are all wicked learning environments.\nHow and Why to Become a Generalist\nAs a rule of thumb, kind learning environments, due to their repetitive nature, are great for computers to excel in: a computer can learn how to play chess better than any human, but it has difficulties learning how to write a beautiful poem.\nThis is why you should become a generalist: robots can replace humans in kind working environments, but wicked learning environments are for humans only.\nSo, become a generalist!\nTo do that, experiment as much as you can, and never \nbehind. However, never forget that there is nothing wrong with a little specialization from time to time.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cRange Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nDubbed \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d by many authors, \nchallenges a notion not many believe can be challenged\u2014namely, that specialization is the only path to excellence.\nAnd Epstein does this in such a compelling manner that even the main advocates of the opposite are sufficiently convinced and have wholeheartedly endorsed this book (we already quoted Malcolm Gladwell above).\n\u201c\n is an urgent and important book, an essential read for bosses, parents, coaches, and anyone who cares about improving performance,\u201d writes \n, amidst commending Epstein on his writing and ability to make the complex comprehensive.\n\u201cIn a world that\u2019s increasingly obsessed with specialization,\u201d adds \n, \u201cstar science writer David Epstein is here to convince you that the future may belong to generalists. It\u2019s a captivating read that will leave you questioning the next steps in your career\u2014and the way you raise your children.\u201d\nAnd, to be frank, this doesn\u2019t seem like an exaggeration to us."},

Do you want neuroscientific tips to enhance its success?\nIf so, you\u2019re reading just the right summary:\nWho Should Read \u201cNeuroscience for Coaches\u201d? And Why?\nEven though all readers may find some interesting things here\u2014like, for example, which parts of the brain are responsible for which activities, and how you can trigger them when you need them (or turn them off when they are a nuisance)\u2014as suggested by the title, this book is specifically written for coaches.\u00a0\nIn other words, if you are not a coach then you can easily skip this book without any fear that you\u2019ve missed something. If you are a coach, however\u2014regardless of your specific line of work\u2014this book will probably become your very special little encyclopedia.\u00a0\nAbout Amy Brann\n is a keynote speaker, a bestselling author of three neuroscience-based books, and the founder of Synaptic Potential.\nEven though she left UCL (where she studied medicine) to focus on her consulting and writing, she has never stopped using her academic knowledge to help coaches achieve better results and perfect their methods.\nIn addition to \n,\nBrann has also authored \n and \n.\nFind out more at \n\u00a0\n\u201cNeuroscience for Coaches PDF Summary\u201d\nWe\u2019ve summarized \n, but, at least to our recollection, none of them defined coach the way Amy Brann does in the first sentence of \n: \u201can expert in facilitating self-directed neuroplasticity.\u201d\nAt first, it may sound a bit mouthful, but if you knew that \u201cneuroplasticity\u201d refers to the brain\u2019s ability to change and if you recalled that \n, then you would see why Brann\u2019s definition is right on the spot.\u00a0\nTo translate it into the language of the common men, it states nothing more than a few facts: 1) that our brain can change; 2) that we can direct the course of its changes; and 3) that a coach is someone who helps us direct this course in a more disciplined manner.\nThat is, after all, what the etymology of the word \u201ccoach\u201d encompasses: a \nis an old word for \u201ca wagon\u201d or \u201ca carriage,\u201d and a \n, much like a wagon or a carriage, takes someone from point A to point B.\nNow, since, ever since the dawn of times, people knew that \n coaching has a long history and, as Brann says, \u201ca huge number of different models, strategies and training programs\u201d have developed around coaching.\u00a0\nis not a book which offers a new, revolutionary way of coaching, nor one that should supersede all previous models.\nIt merely uses the new findings in neuroscience \u201cto \n everything that sits on top of what a coach does.\u201d In other words, it uses science to help you, a coach, better understand the nature of your students.\nshould help you understand \n some of the methods you use as a coach work, and why others don\u2019t, in addition to offering you a clearer picture of what goes around a student\u2019s mind during each of the coaching stages.\nExceptionally structured, Amy Brann\u2019s book is nothing short of an encyclopedia on the subject and a long Q&A session on everything related to it. Therefore, it is impossible for a summary to do the book enough justice (it is in itself a summary of a vast body of knowledge), but nothing stops us from bringing you all the highlights from its first part.\nIn it, Amy Brann introduces us to the structure of the brain and its various areas and explains why coaches should be aware of each of them and how they can use them to facilitate progress and make the most of their training methods.\u00a0\nSo, let\u2019s go!\nThe Triune Brain\u00a0\nBefore delving deeper into the structure of our brains, in a brief introduction, Brann introduces her readers to the evolutionary model of the triune brain, developed by physician and neuroscientist Paul D. MacLean in the 1960s.\nAccording to this model, \u201cattractive in its simplicity\u201d and \u201cwidely espoused,\u201d there are three parts of the brain: the reptilian, the paleomammalian (the limbic), and the neomammalian.\u00a0\nThe first (and the oldest) is responsible for instinctual behaviors, the second for \u201cthings like motivation and emotion involved in feeding, reproductive behavior and parental behavior,\u201d and the last one \u201cfor our higher cognitive functions such as planning, perceiving and language.\u201d\nHowever, modern science is highly skeptical of MacLean\u2019s model and numerous authors suggest that we should abandon it altogether. Unfortunately, the model is very present in non-scientific circles, and this is the only reason why Brann offers this introductory sketch.\nIf you use it, she advises, you need to use it with caution and aware that it functions best as a metaphor or an analogy. In truth, the structure of the brain is far more complex, and, consequently, our reactions are much less predictable.\n1 Prefrontal cortex\nThe prefrontal cortex (PFC), as Brann writes, is \u201caffectionately thought of as the CEO or conductor of the brain responsible for higher-level cognitive functions.\u201d\u00a0\nOne of the newest brain areas, it is involved in all our executive functions, our ability to plan, decision making, expressing our personality, aligning our thoughts and actions with internal goals, and moderating social behavior.\nConsequently, it should be very important to coaches, who need to never forget two things:\n\u2022 The PFC doesn\u2019t function well under stress\n\u2022 The PFC is unable to multitask\nSo, in coaching, you must aim to reduce stress, encourage focus, and break down long lessons into smaller chunks.\n2 Basal ganglia\nThe basal ganglia is \u201ckey to storing routines, repetitive behaviors and thoughts.\u201d In one phrase, it is \u201cthe home of habits.\u201d These habits are stored in the form of thousands of mini-programs or maps which follow sets of \u201cif/then\u201d orders.\nThe main objective of the basal ganglia is simple: to save your brain some energy for more important operations by turning on the autopilot whenever it can.\nCoaching is always about change and progress, so it is essential for your client to understand the structure and the function of the basal ganglia as well. This should help him see why his whole body is so resistant to new habits but also set him up for \n.\n3 Striatum and nucleus accumbens\nThe core component of the basal ganglia, the striatum is a sort of a relay station which receives input from the cerebral cortex and gives input to the basal ganglia. The part of the ventrium closest to the face is called ventral striatum, and part of it is the nucleus accumbens.\nThis part is \u201cinvolved in pleasure, reward, motivation, reinforcement learning, fear, addiction, impulsivity and the placebo effect.\u201d Consequently, it is pretty important for coaches to understand it.\u00a0\nFor example, the nucleus accumbens proves that, even though it sounds as if something picked straight out of an SF movie, it is a scientific fact that there are things happening inside your brain even when you are just imagining things.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s why, imagining a scene when a certain goal has been achieved\u2014what football great Pel\u00e9 deemed \n\u2014is helpful. This doesn\u2019t mean that (as many self-help books claim) visualizing a goal magically leads to its fulfillment.\nHowever, it does mean that visualizing something has a positive effect on your brain and makes the internal environment in your body a more favorable one.\u00a0\n\u201cPeople are more likely to be motivated and take goal-oriented behaviors with a boost of dopamine in the NA,\u201d concludes Amy Brann, busting one of the greatest myths in the self-help industry, \u201cand so visualization may make a particular outcome more likely.\u201d\n4 Insular cortex\nThere is an insula in each of the brain hemispheres; they are areas of the cortex folded deep down between the temporal, parietal and frontal lobes.\nThese insulae are very well connected to the amygdala and are involved in a range of things, including emotions, perception, self-awareness, decision making, cognitive functioning, and interpersonal experience.\u00a0\nIn fact, some authors (such as the renowned Antonio Damasio) suggests that it is because of the insular cortex that rational thinking cannot be separated from feelings and emotions. When the insular cortex is thicker, people are more capable of making a distinction between the objective and the subjective and are much more \u201cin tune\u201d with themselves.\nIt has been demonstrated by numerous studies that mindfulness and meditation\u2014and even yoga and Pilates\u2014improves the cortical structure and makes people more self-aware. No wonder they are included in many coaching programs nowadays: science backs the idea that they should work.\n5 Amygdala\nThe amygdala is an important part of the limbic system which is heavily involved in regulating our emotional life. It is also important in memory, attention (the ability to focus on something while excluding something else) and social processing.\nSimplified, the amygdala is the seat of the \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d response in your brain and the part of the brain which reacts most instinctively, so special care should be taken by coaches if they want to maximize their client\u2019s performance.\nAmy Brann suggests several things:\n\u2022 Fear may hold back a client, so you should be alert if his amygdala is overreacting; sometimes, just opening a discussion on the topic is helpful in itself, since it redirects the brain energy from the amygdala to the prefrontal cortex.\n\u2022 It is quite possible that \u201cjust by being around fear-inducing stuff your unconscious will pick up on this\u201d and you\u2019ll start underperforming. Therefore, start reducing negative inputs: turn off the news, don\u2019t read the newspaper, avoid negative people.\n\u2022 Help your client with his fears by translating them into challenges. This is hugely important since it should free up other areas of your client\u2019s brain and he\u2019ll be more effective and efficient.\u00a0\n\u2022 Help your client to explore unconscious fear triggers.\n\u2022 Prevent your client from making big decisions when he/she is anxious or fearful.\n\u2022 Science says that \u201cworking under pressure doesn\u2019t create optimal brain environments.\u201d So, experiment with alternatives which include discipline, plans, and long-term objectives.\n6 Anterior cingulate cortex\nThe anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) looks like a collar stretched around the frontal part of the corpus callosum (the bundle of neural fibers that connect the left and right hemispheres) and is primarily responsible for conflict or error detection.\nAccording to Francis Crick, \n, the anterior cingulate cortex may be the place where human free will is stored.\u00a0\nWhy?\nBecause the anterior cingulate cortex is excellent in comparing expectations and reality and is great at revealing to us whether what we get is what we have expected. The ACC is more about \u201cawareness\u201d than it is about \nthings, which is why coaches need to stimulate it before doing anything else.\nSince the ACC detects errors, motivating clients to assess and reassess situations by making a constant comparison is always very useful.\n7 Hypothalamus\nThe hypothalamus is a small area of the brain responsible for various metabolic processes and synthesizing and secreting neurohormones.\nIt is important in \u201cregulating hunger, aspects of parenting and attachment behaviors, thirst, fatigue and sleep.\u201d\nConsequently, unless you are working with clients on weight-loss goals, there\u2019s not much you can do with them even if you knew everything hypothalamus-related.\n8 Hippocampus\nLocated in the medial temporal lobe of the brain and resembling a seahorse, the hippocampus consolidates information from short- to long-term memory.\u00a0\nA \n demonstrated that people\u2019s hippocampi are more active when they are successfully navigating, which is why cab drivers have larger than average hippocampi. On the other hand, PTSD results in reductions in the hippocampal volumes.\u00a0\nWhy?\nPossibly because of cortisol (a marker of stress) which has been shown to kill hippocampal cells in animals.\nIf you want to help your clients and excel as a coach, there are several things that you can do to activate the hippocampus and, thus, stimulate memory.\n\u2022 Start doing regular aerobic exercise\n\u2022 Keep cortisol levels low by reducing stress\n\u2022 Turn off your GPS and start finding your way around town using nothing but your brain.\nKey Lessons from \u201cNeuroscience for Coaches\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Triune Brain Model Is Not Accepted by Neuroscientists\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Our Actions Are Influenced by the Structure of Our Brains and Several Brain Chemicals\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Complexities of the Quantum Brain\nThe Triune Brain Model Is Not Accepted by Neuroscientists\nYou\u2019ve probably read this in many books: our brain consists of three parts, the oldest of which (the reptilian) is responsible for our instincts, the middle one (the limbic) for things like motivation and emotion, and the newest one (the neomammalian) for cognitive functions (language, planning, anticipation).\nWell, we\u2019d hate to burst your bubble but this is not backed by science. This model\u2014called the model of the triune brain\u2014was proposed by Paul D. MacLean in the 1960s and has since been disproven as a simplistic understanding of how our brain works.\nIn reality, things are much more complex.\nOur Actions Are Influenced by the Structure of Our Brains and Several Brain Chemicals\nEven though our brain is much more complex than what the proponents of the triune model would like you to believe, it is still highly compartmentalized, with different parts of it responsible for different functions.\u00a0\nNaturally, we are far from understanding all of them, but we do know, thanks to numerous studies, roughly which parts are responsible for roughly which actions and can predict how a human might act in the absence of some of these brain parts.\nThe same holds true for the brain chemicals\u2014\n\u2014which means that, despite the complexity, a coach can direct someone else\u2019s brain-behavior in the right direction using science.\nIn fact, that\u2019s Amy Brann\u2019s definition of a coach: \u201can expert in facilitating self-directed neuroplasticity.\u201d\nThe Complexities of the Quantum Brain\nAmy Brann\u2019s book uses classical biology and classical physics as its basis, but does make a brief intermission in the fifth chapter to talk about something she refers to as \u201cthe quantum brain.\u201d\nBasically, she says that modern physics has questioned the postulates of classical physics and that this may mean that classical neuroscience will soon make space for a much more modern approach as well.\nThis approach may reveal that some things such as \u201cfeeling,\u201d \u201cknowing\u201d and \u201ceffort\u201d are \u201cintrinsically mentalistic and experiential and so cannot be described exclusively in terms of their material make-up,\u201d which is not something most scientists are ready to accept nowadays.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cNeuroscience for Coaches Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nAs John Leary-Joyce\u2014CEO of the Academy of Executive Coaching\u2014suggests \nis the book which can help you \u201cprovide a rational neuroscientific explanation for the interventions\u201d and make the move from \u201cTrust me I\u2019m the coach\u201d to \u201cHere\u2019s the explanation for why this will work.\u201dWe agree enthusiastically: this is a book that every coach even remotely interested in the \n of his work should enjoy reading and rereading. If you are such a coach then you should always have this Amy Brann\u2019s classic next to you in your office.\n\n"},

And they are said to be as old as the discipline itself.\nAccording to a famous anecdote, one of the two \u201cfounders\u201d of AI, Marvin Minsky, enthusiastic about the opportunities AI offers, told his colleague at MIT Douglas Engelbart that \u201cwe\u2019re going to make machines intelligent. We are going to make them conscious!\u201d\nEngelbart, \n back in 1968 (in the \u201cmother of all demos), supposedly replied: \u201cYou\u2019re going to do all that for the machines? What are you going to do for the people?\u201d\nWell, Engelbart was a bit too pessimistic since AI can already do a number of things for the people who know how to use its potential.\nFor example, in addition to translating and navigating, It can also:\nNo wonder the World Economic Forum is \n, and Yuval Noah Harari is warning millennials everywhere that \n.\nThat is how things stand even today: a robot might take your job any instant now (\n), and AI is to blame for that.\nBut that is not bad at all.\nA Brief History of AI\nSince we already mentioned Minsky and Engelbart, it is only appropriate that we mention a thing or two about some other historical developments in the field of AI so that we can understand how we got to be on the brink of automation.\nIn a nutshell, the evolution of AI is the development of controlled if/then workflows through guided learning systems to machine learning.\nAs mentioned, in the beginning, AI comprised nothing more than the development of \u201cif this than that\u201d programs called \u201cexpert systems.\u201d These expert systems were basically knowledge maps, branching out in one or another direction based on the choice made by a user.\u00a0\nUnder the guise of AI, many of these systems are still in use today: most of those chatbots you encounter on your favorite websites use nothing more than rudimentary AI.\nDue to little funding and over-inflated expectations, AI passed through two \u201cAI Winters,\u201d during which advances in the technology stagnated. Both of them lasted for six years (the first one between 1974 to 1980, and the second one from 1987 to 1993), but nowadays it is very different due to \u201cfour key drivers\u201d:\n\u2022 \n: AI needs \u201cmillions of examples\u201d to be accurate, but today\u2019s continual use of the Internet provides it with even more data than necessary;\n\u2022 \n: In 1980, 1GB of storage cost, on average, $437,500. Just a decade later, it was a fortieth of that price: $11,200. Nowadays, 1GB of storage costs less than 2 cents!\n\u2022 \n:\n\u00a0we\u2019ve already told you a little bit about \n; well, it turns out its predictions were accurate\u2014processors are getting smaller and faster every single year.\n\u2022 \n: up until 1993, very few people had Internet; now, very few people don\u2019t. That\u2019s a big difference.\nThanks to these key drivers, AI is getting better by the second and is now able to learn in an unsupervised manner.\u00a0\nIn the more common supervised learning, AI systems are trained and guided by other people. For example, if you want AI to learn what is a dog, you can train it by \u201cfeeding\u201d it with millions of images and telling it which ones of them are dogs, and which are not.\nHowever, in the more SF unsupervised learning, systems start with a blank slate, and they are fed data which initially means nothing to them. In time, however, they are able to notice patterns and make sense of it.\nAI Capabilities Framework\nAndrew Burgess has developed a framework that \u201cboils down\u201d all of AI\u2019s complexity into eight capabilities, subsequently divided into two sets:\n\u2022 Image recognition \n\u2022 Speech recognition\n\u2022 Search\n\u2022 Clustering\n\u2022 Natural Language Understanding (NLU)\n\u2022 Optimization\n\u2022 Prediction\n\u2022 Understanding\nNow the first four capabilities listed above (image and speech recognition, search, and clustering) focus on figuring out \u201c\n is happening\u201d in a data set. They identify, distinguish and group things, converting unstructured data to structured data.\nThe second set deals more with \n the structured data (\u201c\n is it happening\u201d) in one way or another and, unlike the first set (which is training-based) includes some type of machine-based (almost independent) output.\u00a0\nNLU, for example, includes a degree of understanding and it requires cognition. It is through a similar type of cognition that machines are able to transform data from one form or another (optimization) or even predict whether something will happen or not (prediction).\nThe last of these eight capabilities\u2014understanding\u2014is still not commercially available, but it is what most people expect AI to become: conscious awareness of a machine of its thoughts and actions.\nAI in Action\nThough Artificial Intelligence can do a lot of things, it can\u2019t do everything. But in combination with some associated technologies (cloud computing, robotics, IoT, or crowdsourcing), it can change absolutely everything about the world that we know.\nIn fact, it is already changing things!\nWe\u2019ve already mentioned chatbots which are so simple that they are not even considered AI anymore. But though they do \nthings for which human intelligence is necessary and that is a great thing. Complex chatbots can do so much more: through extensive training, they can become almost indistinguishable from humans\u2014\n.\nAll of the recommendations you get on Amazon or Netflix are due to AI, which is immensely better than humans in suggesting future purchases (optimization & prediction) based on previous acquisitions (search & clustering).\u00a0\nBritish retailer Tesco combines AI and robotics to ease restocking. Through image recognition, robots identify product gaps by filming the shelves and comparing them to the shelves\u2019 optimal condition.\nPossibly even more interesting and less known, an Israeli tech company named Nexar teaches people to become better drivers by using and structuring information from a dashcam app.\nAll in all, the options are many, and leaders should identify the spheres where AI can help them and act as soon as possible.\nYour AI Journey\nBurgess is often asked by executives how can they implement AI in their business. He claims it is the wrong question. The much more appropriate one is: \u201cI have some big business objectives/challenges\u2014how can AI help me deliver or address them?\u201d\nWell, this is how.\nAs is the case with everything else, implementing AI starts with self-\n, and Burgess suggests using the \u201cAI Maturity Matrix\u201d before doing anything else.\u00a0\nOriginally developed by Carnegie Mellon University to assess the maturity of IT development functions, maturity matrices generally describe five levels of maturity\u2014from very immature (Level 1, or \u2018Initial\u2019) to world-class (Level 5, or \u2018Optimizing\u2019).\nHowever, the \u201cAI Maturity Matrix\u201d has six levels rather than five:\n: \n. This is the basic level when there is very little evidence of any IT optimization in an organization.\n. The organization has implemented task-specific IT applications for particular processes (e.g., an invoice processing application to process invoices), but has not applied automation more broadly.\n. Some people in an organization do things automatically (using scripts or macros) with little to no benefit; data is still managed on a nominal basis.\n. At level 3, an organization starts tactically applying a single automation tool to meet specific goals.\n. At this stage, an organization already has a reputation for implementing new technologies and being innovative, since it has started deploying a range of automation tools, whose benefits are observable and sizeable.\n. At this level, an organization has implemented a strategic end-to-end process automation program with a range of automation tools, including AI.\nIn addition to this \u201cAI Maturity Matrix,\u201d Burgess advises creating an \u201cAI Heat Map\u201d as well so that a company can get \u201ca top-down perspective on areas where AI is desirable, economically viable and/or technically feasible.\u201d\nAn AI Heat Map looks something like this:\nThere are many steps between the \u201cAI Maturity Matrix\u201d/\u201dAI Heat Map\u201d and the implementation of AI in your organization\u2014say, developing the AI business case, an AI roadmap, an AI strategy\u2014but let\u2019s say you\u2019re there. What\u2019s next?\nWell, first of all, you must align everything with your new vision: a Level-5 AI-based automated company. This includes adding new positions such as CAO (chief automation officer) and CDO (chief data officer).\nThe last one is especially important if you take into consideration that with AI, data is everything, and \u201cdata fidelity\u201d can make or break AI.\u00a0\nSpeaking of which, there\u2019s always hazard that AI can also break your company, since, much like Sheldon from \n,\nit doesn\u2019t understand social conventions, and can be hacked, via training, by people with malicious intentions. (Just ask \n who became a racist after a single day).\nFinally, AI can be used as a tool against AI. For example, if you are a bank, and you implement voice recognition as part of your safety system, an AI can be trained to mimic the voices necessary to gain access to a specific account.\nThe Future of AI\nBe that as it may, AI\u2019s future looks brighter than ever!\nImage and voice recognition have been improving so well during the past few years that, very soon, it would be difficult to recognize whether you\u2019re talking to a bot or a real person on the phone (not to mention, \n).\nClustering and searching are becoming ever more efficient and accurate, which means that optimization and predicting will also improve. The only problem\u2014and it will be a problem for a while\u2014is the lack of high-quality data sets, but Burgess believes that will find a solution for that as well. Afterward, both NLU and Understanding \n.\u00a0\nIf you don\u2019t want to be the last to hop on the bandwagon, you better do it right away!\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Executive Guide to Artificial Intelligence\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 AI Is Everywhere Around You\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 AI\u2019s Complexity Can Be Boiled Down into a Framework of Eight Capabilities\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 AI Is Here to Stay\u2014and You Better Implement It in Your Organization\nAI Is Everywhere Around You\nWhether you\u2019re using Google Translate to understand what the tattoo of your favorite pop artist means in your language or you\u2019re navigating through the streets of Cairo, whether you are searching for very specific information in a large bulk of data or simply clicking on images of traffic lights in captchas\u2014you are actually either using or training AI systems.\nAI\u2019s Complexity Can Be Boiled Down into a Framework of Eight Capabilities\nEven though AI is a complex phenomenon, Andrew Burgess has devised a framework which boils down its complexity into eight capabilities: image recognition, speech recognition, search, clustering, natural language understanding (NLU), optimization, prediction, and understanding.\nThe first four of these skills help AI understand \u201c\n is happening\u201d in a given data set, and in the other four it is coming up with a solution as to \u201c\n it is happening.\u201d\nAlmost all AI-based apps can be explained through the use of these eight capabilities.\nAI Is Here to Stay\u2014and You Better Implement It in Your Company Fast\nEvery time you search for something on Google or post something on Facebook, you are feeding AI\u2014which makes it stronger and better. At least for now, there\u2019s no way to stop this, meaning you better join in.\nNo matter what kind of an organization you lead, AI can help you in numerous ways, so you better assess how mature you are for the transformation (via an \u201cAI maturity matrix\u201d), identify how can AI help you improve (via an \u201cAI heat map\u201d) and start implementing it and automating processes!\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Executive Guide to Artificial Intelligence Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nHighly accessible even to a novice, Andrew Burgess\u2019 book is not only recommendable to anyone with even a vague interest in modern technology but also essential for everyone who wants to implement AI in his company.\nEven though quite brief and not proofread as a book of its kind is supposed to be, \ncertainly offers a lot and is precisely what the blurb states it is: a comprehensive introduction to AI and everything related, especially suitable for managers and executives.\nWe dare you to not feel a bit smarter after finishing the book."},

Have you ever thought that you may be the boss in such an organization?\nEither way, it\u2019s time to change that! Amy C. Edmondson is here to teach you how to turn your company into a psychologically safe workplace, or, as she would say:\n.\nWho Should Read \u201cThe Fearless Organization\u201d? And Why?\nIf you don\u2019t know Amy Edmondson, then it\u2019s not a bad idea to get to know her via her \n which discusses psychologically safe workplaces and how to build them.\nIf you\u2019ve already watched the TED Talk, then you already know this is a great book, which should interest bosses and employees alike, hopefully even inspiring both groups (especially the former) to change their ways.\nAbout Amy Edmondson\n is an American scholar, the Novartis Professor of Leadership and Management at the Harvard Business School.\nAfter working as Chief Engineer for renowned architect/inventor Buckminster Fuller in the 1980s, Edmondson embarked on an exceptional academic career, specializing in concepts such as \u201cteaming\u201d and \u201cpsychological safety.\u201d\nShe has been included in the biannual Thinkers50 list every time since 2011, and even honored with its Talent Award in 2017.\n\u201cThe Fearless Organization PDF Summary\u201d\n\u201cToday\u2019s employees,\u201d writes Edmondson in the \u201cIntroduction\u201d to \n,\n\u201cat all levels, spend 50% more time collaborating than they did 20 years ago. Hiring talented individuals is not enough,\u201d she deduces. \u201cThey have to be able to work well together.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, teamwork is not an under-researched phenomenon.\u00a0\nOn the contrary: whether it is through fables (Lencioni\u2019s \nand \n) or through more rigorous interdisciplinary analogy-based studies (General Stanley McChrystal\u2019s \n), teamwork is one of the most investigated aspects of modern work environments.\u00a0\nIn one of the more thought-provoking and wide-ranging analyses of this subject, Daniel Coyle\u2019s \n, the author singles out \u201csafety\u201d as the most crucial skill in the toolkit of a thriving work environment.\nAnne Edmonson agrees and goes a step further: in her two-decade-long research of the topic, she has discovered that a factor she calls \u201cpsychological safety\u201d \u201chelps explain differences in performance in workplaces that include hospitals, factories, schools, and government agencies.\u201d\nWhat does she mean by psychological safety?\nIn her own words:\nOf course, as Amy Edmonson makes abundantly clear, psychological safety is not the only factor that needs to be taken into consideration as far as work performance is concerned. However, she has purposefully singled it out because, as she demonstrates, it is certainly one of the most important ones in today\u2019s world\u2014as proven by its popularity in the last few years.\nA pioneer in the area, Edmondson explores every aspect of this culture of psychological safety in \n, and provides \u201ca blueprint for bringing it to life.\u201d In fact, a psychologically safe company is what a fearless organization essentially is: \u201cone in which interpersonal fear is minimized so that team and organizational performance can be maximized in a knowledge-intensive world.\u201d\nThis book is divided into three parts which are in turn divided into a total of eight chapters. Let\u2019s have a look at each of them!\nPart I: The Power of Psychological Safety\nThe first part of \nconsists of two chapters \u201cthat introduce the concept of psychological safety and offer a brief history of the research on this important workplace phenomenon.\u201d\nWe\u2019ll look at why psychological safety matters, as well as why it\u2019s not the norm in many organizations.\nThrough \u201ca disguised true story taking place in a hospital,\u201d Edmonson introduces the readers to the concept of psychological safety, showing \u201cat once the ordinariness of an employee holding back at work\u2014not sharing a concern or a question\u2014as well as the profound implications this human reflex can have for the quality of work in almost any organization.\u201d\nContrary to what many leaders believed in the past, fear is not an effective motivator, and this is doubly true today when most jobs require people to learn, improve, and collaborate almost constantly. Due to fear, consciously or not, people often inhibit themselves from sharing their ideas, questions, and concerns, and when people don\u2019t speak up, the organization\u2019s ability to innovate and grow is threatened.\nSo that they can stop being silent, a psychologically safe climate must be cultivated.\u00a0\nHowever, bear in mind \n\u2026\n\u2022 \u2026\n: conflict would (and should) inevitably arise, no matter how perfect the work environment is; psychological safety is about being honest and about letting people on different sides of a conflict express their opinions;\n\u2022 \n: work climate affects different people in similar ways; regardless of whether they are introverts or extroverts, most workers would speak their mind up in a psychologically safe environment;\n\u2022 \n: though similar concepts, the key difference between trust and psychological safety is that the latter is not experienced at personal, but at a group level. In addition, as Edmondson says, \u201ctrust is about giving others the benefit of the doubt, and psychological safety relates to whether others will give you the benefit of the doubt when, for instance, you have asked for help or admitted a mistake.\u201d\n\u2022 \n: psychological safety is not about being \u201ccomfortable\u201d at work or about creating \u201canything goes\u201d environment. As the table below demonstrates, It is about quite the opposite:\nIn the second chapter of \n, Edmondson\npresents \u201ckey findings from a systematic review of academic research on psychological safety.\u201d\nShe doesn\u2019t provide many details on the individual studies listed in the bibliography, but gives \u201can overview of how research on psychological safety has provided evidence supporting the central argument in this book\u2014that no twenty-first-century organization can afford to have a culture of fear.\u201d\nThe studies Edmondson overviews show that a fearless organization \u201cis not only a better place for employees, it\u2019s also a place where innovation, growth, and performance take hold.\u201d\nPart II: Psychological Safety at Work\nThe four chapters in the second part of \n\u201cpresent real-world case studies of workplaces in both private and public-sector organizations to show how psychological safety (or its absence) shapes business results and human safety performance.\u201d\nIn the third chapter, Edmondson digs into a few cases in which \u201cworkplace fear allowed an illusion of business success, postponing inevitable discoveries of underlying problems that had gone unreported and unaddressed for a period of time.\u201d\nThe chapter covers the rise and demise of a few iconic companies (Volkswagen, Nokia, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs) led and managed by way of fear, possibly best illustrated in the two quotations used as epigraphs to this chapter:\u00a0\n\u2022 \u201cI feel misused by my own company.\u201d \u2014 Oliver Schmidt, Volkswagen engineer\n\u2022 \u201cUntil I know what my boss thinks, I don\u2019t want to tell you.\u201d \u2014 Regulator, Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY)\nThe main takeaways from these studies (and this chapter) are the following:\n\u2022 If you are a leader and you only want to hear good news, you create fear which blocks you from learning the truth\u2014until it is too late;\n\u2022 Consequently, a lack of psychological safety\u2014aka a work environment in which people can voice their opinions\u2014only creates an illusion of success, which, in the long run, can turn into serious business failure;\n\u2022 A psychologically safe environment is not that fragile since shortcomings become known early and the size and the impact of the future failure can nearly always be mitigated.\nThe fourth chapter starts where the third leaves off and \u201chighlights workplaces where employees, customers, or communities suffered avoidable physical or emotional harm because employees, living in a culture of fear, were reluctant to speak up, ask questions, or get help.\u201d\n\u201cA culture of silence is a dangerous culture,\u201d warns Edmondson, demonstrating how in many places (say, hospitals or nuclear reactors: remember \n?), not creating a psychologically safe environment is not a luxury one has, because it can lead to a tragic loss of life.\n\u201cExcessive confidence in authority is a risk factor in psychological and physical safety,\u201d concludes Edmondson, advising leaders to be more open to criticism and willing to learn from their subordinates.\nAfter showing the dangers of the old-style fear-based management, in the fifth chapter Edmondson finally shows us the other side of the coin, introducing us to the psychologically safe environment of a few organizations she is not afraid to describe as \u201cfearless.\u201d\n\u201cBarry Wehmiller, Google X, Eileen Fisher, Bridgewater, and Pixar,\u201d she writes in the conclusion of this chapter, \u201chave little in common on the surface. Yet they have managed to create work environments characterized by unusual levels of candor, engagement, collaboration, and risk-taking, all of which have contributed to the creation of successful businesses\u2014in strikingly varied ways.\u201d\nThe three crucial takeaways from Chapter 5:\n\u2022 If the employees are encouraged to be honest, the company is more creative and more innovative;\n\u2022 If you are a leader, be willing to say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d when you don\u2019t have an answer: these three simple words are so powerful in engaging the hearts and minds of employees that, without too much exaggeration, can be described as the basis of a psychologically safe environment.\n\u2022 all in all, \u201ccreating an environment that values employees yields benefits in engagement, problem-solving, and performance.\u201d\nChapter 6 examines a few more psychologically safe companies, \u201cwhere psychological safety helps to ensure employee and client safety and dignity.\u201d\nThe cases covered here show that \u201cclear, direct, candid communication is an important aspect of reducing accidents\u201d and that \u201cworker safety starts with encouraging and reinforcing employees\u2019 speaking up about hazards and other concerns.\u201d\nThat is why a good company is one which motivates its workers to do whatever is necessary to ensure safe-work practices and employee dignity, even at the cost of immediate losses.\u00a0\nHistory has repeatedly shown that this pays dividends\u2014in the long run.\nPart III: Creating a Fearless Organization\nIn the third part of \nEdmondson includes two chapters which \u201cfocus on the question of what leaders must do to create a fearless organization\u2014an organization where everyone can bring his or her full self to work, contribute, grow, thrive, and team up to produce remarkable results.\u201d\nChapter 7 is one of the most essential chapters in Edmondson\u2019s book since it contains the leader\u2019s tool kit, aka a simple three-step framework of activities which leaders\u2014at the top and throughout an organization\u2014can use to create a more engaged and vital workforce.\u00a0\nThe three interrelated practices which help in creating psychological safety are: setting the stage, inviting participation, and responding productively.\nAs shown on the table below, each of these practices encompasses sub-steps that \u201cmust be repeatedly used, in \n, learning-oriented ways, to create and restore a climate of candor in an ongoing way.\u201d\nThe final chapter updates a few stories and offers answers to some of the questions the author is most frequently asked by people in companies regarding psychological safety.\u00a0\nHere are the three that seemed most interesting to us:\nThe short answer is \u201cno\u201d and the long answer that even if there is such a thing as \u201ctoo much psychological safety,\u201d the risks of being a fear-based company far exceed those of going beyond the limit of optimal psychological safety.\nOn the contrary: whistle-blowing is \u201cnot a reflection of psychological safety but rather an indication of its absence.\u201d\n \nWell, there are exceptions. Steve Jobs is a famous example, just as is Henry Ford who is reported to have once complained, \u201cwhy is it every time I ask for a pair of hands, they come with a brain attached?\u201d Edmondson suggests that there are rare geniuses who, indeed, have all the answers, but for the majority of companies, this approach is simply wrong and comes with too many risks.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Fearless Organization\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Psychological Safety Is All About Being an Employee Comfortable Expressing Yourself\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Psychological Safety Is Not About Lowering Performance Standards\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Leader\u2019s Tool Kit for Building Psychological Safety\nPsychological Safety Is All About Being an Employee Comfortable Expressing Yourself\nUntil just a while ago, companies were led by arrogant top-down dictators and managed by fear.\u00a0\nHowever, through two decades of research, Amy Edmondson has discovered that not only has this changed, but it has also changed for a reason: companies do not have the luxury of being psychologically unsafe.\nWorking for a company where you cannot express yourself, and you are in constant fear that the things you\u2019d say may be met with ridicule and contempt is not only bad for you\u2014it is bad for the company as well.\nNumerous studies and case studies prove that, in these kinds of environments, success is only a short-term concept.\nPsychological Safety Is Not About Lowering Performance Standards\nMany managers and leaders think that allowing their subordinates to express their opinion freely is a recipe for disaster\u2014at least in terms of performance standards.\nHowever, Edmondson says that creating a psychologically safe environment doesn\u2019t mean creating a comfort zone\u2014it means replacing the anxiety zone for a \u201cLearning & High-Performance Zone\u201d where ideas are constantly pitted against each other, and creativity blooms out of conflict.\nThe Leader\u2019s Tool Kit for Building Psychological Safety\nIn essence, the leader\u2019s tool kit is a three-step blueprint which aims to structure the actions and activities of someone who is in charge of a company with the final goal of creating a fearless psychologically safe organization.\nFirst, a leader must set the stage by framing the work (setting the expectations and clarifying the need for voice) and emphasizing the purpose (identifying what\u2019s at stake, why it matters and for whom) so that he accomplishes an atmosphere of shared expectations and meaning.\nNext, he must invite participation by demonstrating situational humility (admitting gaps), practicing inquiry (asking good questions) and setting up structures and processes (creating forums and providing guidelines for discussion).\u00a0\nThis results in confidence in the employees that every voice is welcome and sets the stage for the final step: responding productively. This encompasses expressing appreciation, destigmatizing failure, and sanctioning clear violations which, in turn, should achieve company-wide orientation toward continuous learning.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Fearless Organization Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nis just the perfect combination of academic eruditeness and down-to-earth \u201cnuts and bolts\u201d approach that we\u2019ve come to expect from HBR professors and associates.\nAs such, it is undoubtedly a book that is not only helpful as a theoretical framework but extremely effective as a practical manual as well.\nIf you are a boss or a leader of a team, ignore its bits of advice at your peril."},

And Why?\nEven though much more moderate, \nis polarizing enough that some people deem it an accidental part of the Manosphere canon. In other words, it is a book that perhaps fans of Neil Strauss\u2019 \nRobert Green\u2019s \n\u2014and even Robert Glover\u2019s \n or Rollo Tomassi\u2019s \nshould enjoy.\nHowever, to use the words of the author from the \u201cIntroduction\u201d to the 20\n anniversary edition, \n is also a book \u201cwritten explicitly for people who have already achieved respect for other genders and sexual preferences, and who consider men and women to be social, economic, and political equals.\u201d\nSo, be warned: if you don\u2019t believe the above, then it may be a bit dangerous to read \nbecause you might get the wrong idea about what men and women are, and instead of a better man, become a worse man after putting its suggestions into practice.\nAbout David Deida\n is a bestselling American author.\nA founding member of the Integral Institute and one of Watkins Spiritual 100, he has written ten books that have been so far published in more than 25 languages worldwide.\nSome of these are \n, \n, and the autobiographical novel \n.\nFind out more at \n.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Way of the Superior Man PDF Summary\u201d\n\u201cThis book,\u201d writes Deida at the beginning of \n,\nis a guide for a specific kind of newly evolving man. This man is unabashedly masculine\u2014he is purposeful, confident, and directed, living his chosen way of life with deep integrity and humor\u2014and he is sensitive, spontaneous, and spiritually alive, with a heart-commitment to discovering and living his deepest truth.\u201d\nIf you want to become this man\u2014who is neither a King Kong nor a wimp, neither an old-style macho nor an androgynous Mr. Nice Guy\u2014then read on. As Deida says:\nPart One: A Man\u2019s Way\nAs suggested by the very title, there is such a thing as a man\u2019s way\u2014and it is a way very different from the way of the woman.\nIn order to tread upon it you need to:\n\u201cAs long as life continues, the creative challenge is to tussle, play, and make love with the present moment while giving your unique gift,\u201d writes Deida. Things never end, so don\u2019t act like they will. Embrace the fight and march ahead.\nBoys don\u2019t cry\u2014according to the old macho ideal. According to the Way of the Superior Man, they do when they need to, because it is much better to live with a hurting, than a closed heart. Don\u2019t act: stay and act from inside the wound of pain.\nBoth literally and metaphorically. A man must love his father, but he must never allow to live in his shadow. That\u2019s why, in strictly Freudian manner, it is essential to kill your father.\u00a0\n\u2022 \nEach man has a capacity for growth, i.e. a limit. Don\u2019t forget this. Because \u201cwhere a man\u2019s edge is located is less important than whether he is actually living his edge in truth, rather than being lazy or deluded.\u201d\n\u2022 \n and hold onto it. Do anything necessary to discover your purpose and then organize your life around it.\n\u2022 \nHolding onto your why means not being a wimp: never betray your purpose for a woman.\n\u2022 \n\u201cEvery man knows that his highest purpose in life cannot be reduced to any particular relationship,\u201d writes Deida. \u201cIf a man prioritizes his relationship over his highest purpose, he weakens himself, disserves the universe, and cheats his woman of an authentic man who can offer her full, undivided presence.\u201d\n\u2022 \nDon\u2019t stay in your comfort zone. Freedom is all about pushing your limits. Lean just beyond your edge and do this constantly. In everything you do.\n\u2022\n\u201cThe way a man penetrates the world should be the same way he penetrates his woman,\u201d says Deida in an oft-quoted sentence of this chapter, \u201cnot merely for personal gain or pleasure, but to magnify love, openness, and depth.\u201d\n\u2022 \nWomen are hurt by criticism: this is, after all, their nature. Men, however, should never be. They should always be open to receiving direct criticism from other men and make use of it. This is the sign of the Superior Man.\n\u2022 \nBack to your purpose. What are you doing without it, man? Men without a purpose are not only lost and drifting, they are also sexually impotent and incapable of putting things into motion.\n\u2022 \nIf your purpose doesn\u2019t align with your form of living, you must be prepared to alter absolutely everything about yourself to make amends and start living the life you were destined to.\n\u2022 \n\u201cA man should, of course, be a full participant in caring for children and the household,\u201d writes Deida in a controversial sentence, \u201cbut if he gives up his deepest purpose to do so, ultimately, everyone suffers.\u201d\u00a0\n\u2022 \nThere is nothing more important than your purpose. Everything else is just a bunch of minutiae. Don\u2019t let yourself get lost in these everyday tasks and duties. Focus on what\u2019s important.\n\u2022\nIn a way, a woman is created to test her man\u2014in the form of \u201ccomplaining, challenging him, changing her mind, doubting him, distracting him, or even undermining his purpose in a subtle or not so subtle way.\u201d Appreciate and embrace this. Because, as Deida writes:\nPart Two: Dealing with Women\nOn the subject of women\u2014in part two, Deida explains how a man should deal with them in the proper manner. And he shares seven insights and practical bits of advice:\nThe word \u201clying\u201d is a masculine word, in the sense that only men are consistent and can lie or tell the truth. Women, being emotional, say how they feel at the present moment. \u201cA man\u2019s word is his honor,\u201d says Deida. \u201cA woman\u2019s word is her true expression in the moment.\u201d\n\u2022 \nMen grow by challenge, while women by praise. So, praise your woman freely and unabashedly.\n\u2022 \nIn yet another somewhat paradoxical piece of advice, Deida claims that while a man should love a woman and serve her with every ounce of his being, he \u201cshouldn\u2019t tolerate bitchy and complaining moodiness.\u201d Tolerating leads to resenting, and resenting to breaking up or divorcing.\n\u2022 \nAs we said above, women are not consistent. And because they change constantly, no analysis will ever pin them down. Accept your woman the same way you accept the weather: even the storms are part of a pattern that promises a sunny day just around the corner.\n\u2022 \nA big no-no: the feminine is \u201cpure energy in motion\u201d and \n or \n are negation of this. And if the suggestion for something like that comes from you\u2014that\u2019s even worse!\n\u2022\nApparently, when a woman gets emotionally intense, the superior man is capable of penetrating her mood \u201cwith imperturbable love and unwavering consciousness.\u201d Try doing that and stop being the mediocre man who wants to discuss things over.\u00a0\n\u2022 \nOne of the foundational masculine traits is taking responsibility. And making decisions comes with this. Forcing your woman to make decisions\u2014or even allowing her this\u2014may backfire, because, unlike men, women don\u2019t feel comfortable taking responsibility.\nPart Three: Working with Polarity and Energy\nAs the old wisdom says: opposites attract. Here\u2019s Deida take on this:\nAbout 80% of all men have a more masculine sexual essence, says Deida, and all of these men are attracted to all things feminine (radiant women, music, nature, beer, etc.) It is simply inevitable. Don\u2019t hide this attraction: allow it flourish.\n\u2022\nLove is a simple equation according to Deida: \u201cIf a man is very masculine by nature, then he will be attracted to a very feminine woman, who will complement his energy. The more neutral or balanced he is, the more balanced he will prefer his woman. And, if a man is more feminine by nature, his energy will be complemented by the strong direction and purposiveness of a more masculine woman.\u201d\n\u2022 \nAs can be deduced from the quote above, the more masculine a man is, the better it is not only for him, but for his woman as well. Because the more masculine is, the more he will crave for his woman\u2019s feminine energy, giving her a chance to develop in the right direction.\n\u2022 \nThere is no way to avoid this. However, there is a way to not act upon it. And you shouldn\u2019t\u2014because it eventually ends up complicating your life much more than anything else.\n\u2022 \nEven old men like younger women, and young men rarely like older women. Why? Because \u201cyouth in a woman bespeaks radiant, unobstructed, and refreshing feminine energy.\u201d\n\u2022 \nTime for another generalization: there are \u201chot\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d women. If you need a stereotype, dark-skinned, brunette, red-headed, Korean, and Polynesian women are hot, and blonde, light-skinned, Japanese, and Chinese women are cool. It is irritating to have a hot woman when you need someone to cool you, and vice versa. Understand the temperature of feminine energy and choose wisely.\nPart Four: What Women Really Want\nJust like Mel Gibson in the similarly-titled movie, Deida knows precisely what women want. And he shares his findings in the fourth part of \n.\n\u2022 \nEvolutionary biologists mostly share this opinion: it\u2019s the ladies who choose. Deida phrases this thus: \u201cIf a man wants a woman who doesn\u2019t want him, he cannot win.\u201d So, choose a woman who choose you to be her partner.\n\u2022\nMen and women speak different languages, so don\u2019t try to hard to understand your woman. Instead, think of her outbursts and illogical beliefs as tests, and pass them by magnifying love, consciousness, and success in your woman\u2019s life, \n of her requests.\n\u2022 \nDon\u2019t believe the literal content of a woman\u2019s complaint. Just like babies\u2019 cries, a woman\u2019s complaints are warning bells and indications of a mood. Act accordingly, and never steer away from your purpose.\n\u2022 \n\u201cAlthough she would never admit it,\u201d writes Deida, a woman \u201cwants to feel that her man would be willing to sacrifice their relationship for the sake of his highest purpose.\u201d So, don\u2019t treat her as if she is more important than that, once again, \nof her requests.\n\u2022 \nEven if you are perfect for ten years, thirty minutes of idiotism will cause your woman to forget your excellent track record. Men base their opinion of women on their past behavior, but for women this is irrelevant.\n\u2022 \nTake charge: financially, sexually, emotionally, and spiritually. A woman can relax only if you take the wheel and steer the course independently from her.\nPart Five: Your Dark Side\nDon\u2019t allow, for a second, to lose track of your dark side. A woman wants a man\u2019s dark side. In fact, that is precisely what she wants in a man: the monster, the killer, in him. (Think \n, for example).\n\u201cThe masculine is always seeking release from constraint into freedom,\u201d writes Deida. \u201cThe feminine often doesn\u2019t understand these masculine ways and needs.\u201d Regardless of the latter: try to find your freedom.\nIt is dark the masculine force; if you disown it, you are kinking its hose and. thus, you weaken your masculine capacity to face the unknown while still being able to love your woman.\nFearlessness is \u201ca quintessential form of the ultimate masculine gift.\u201d A woman is turned off by men who are afraid: she wants someone capable of killing a mouse without blinking, someone ready to face everything that comes along the way, no matter how scary.\n\u201cThe feminine destructress must be met by the masculine destroyer. The goddess of devotion must be met by the god of all-pervading love.\u201d Equal the energy of your woman with appropriate consciousness: all other ways lead to destruction.\nPart Six: Feminine Attractiveness\nWhat makes the feminine in a woman attractive? Here\u2019s what:\nIn women, there is never a shortage of feminine energy. There is, however, \u201cresistance to receiving, trusting, and embracing it.\u201d Open your heart and stop resisting: Life itself is the feminine.\nMen shouldn\u2019t compare older women to younger women: they should allow the former to be wise and powerful, intuitive and healing.\nDon\u2019t deny your sexual attraction to a woman, but don\u2019t disperse it in mental fantasies as well. Let it circulate through your body and fill your heart.\nA man must cultivate a polarized relationship to his woman and his world: this is the only way for him to remain in relationship with either. If you deny your desire for the feminine, you depolarize yourself, and that leads to impotence and purposelessness.\n\u201cA man\u2019s attraction to women must be converted from attraction \n women into attraction \n women,\u201d writes Deida. \u201cHe must feel through her beauty, into the very delight of which her beauty is but a ripple and reminder. His whole relation to appearance is epitomized in his relation to women, either as obsession, distraction, or revelation.\u201d\nPart Seven: Body Practices\nYou know you want to hear Deida\u2019s opinion on sex. So let\u2019s talk about the physical aspect of relationship a bit!\nIf you don\u2019t have control over your ejaculation, then you cannot meet your woman\u2019s needs. You must learn to convert the ejaculation \u201cinto non-ejaculatory whole body, brain, and heart orgasms.\u201d Whatever that is.\n\u201cThe principal bodily key to mastering the world and women is maintaining a full and open front of the body at all times,\u201d suggest Deida. \u201cThe best method is through full and relaxed breathing, drawing energy down the front, and freeing attention from neurotic self-concern.\u201d\nThrough the use of breath, feeling, and intention, you can contract the pelvic floor near the genitals and draw some energy up the spine. The result is a rejuvenating orgasm, which Deida poetically describes as an explosion of energy into the brain, from where it rains down through the body \u201clike an ambrosial bliss.\u201d\nPart Eight: Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Yoga of Intimacy\nThe final part of \nis dedicated on something Deida calls the \u201cyoga of intimacy.\u201d Here are his final instructions which should help you become a more evolved form of a man.\n\u2022\nThe only way for a relationship to work between a man and a woman is for them to respect each other\u2019s priorities. The more masculine a man is, the more important his mission is to him; the more feminine a woman is, the more important an intimate relationship is to her. How one can solve this \u201cprimary asymmetry\u201d through something more than just \u201ctaking it into account,\u201d we don\u2019t know. But one must\u2014for a relationship to work.\n\u2022 \nA woman is responsible for her man\u2019s bodily energy (i.e., erections), and a man is responsible for the woman\u2019s openness of mood and depth of love. In other words, the \u201cdirection of growth of a relationship is primarily the man\u2019s responsibility\u201d\n\u2022 \nA macho man\u2019s way of dealing with his woman is \u201cMy way or the high way.\u201d Mr. Nice Guy\u2019s way is the way of compromise or even self-negation: \u201cOK, your way.\u201d But a Superior Man\u2019s way is the way of inspiring his woman to tread the path that most serves her growth in love and happiness.\n\u2022 \nA woman strengthens her feminine radiance best \u201cin the company of other women in mutual celebration and play.\u201d A man, on the other hand, restores his purpose mainly in solitude, when faced with challenges, or in the company of other men like him. Arrange for all of these forms of restoration.\n\u2022 \n\u201cLike dissolving in the intensity of an orgasm, a man\u2019s greatest desire is to be utterly released,\u201d writes Deida in his final lesson, once again in a poetic manner. \u201cDie in the giving of your gift, so you don\u2019t even notice you have stopped holding onto yourself. Fear is your final excuse. Don\u2019t fight it. Love through it.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Way of the Superior Man\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Your Purpose Comes First, Your Women Come Second\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Embrace Both Your Masculinity and Your Woman\u2019s Femininity\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Own Your Darkest Desires\nYour Purpose Comes First, Your Women Come Second\n\u201cYour mission is your priority,\u201d writes Deida in the first part of \n\u201cUnless you know your mission and have aligned your life to it, your core will feel empty. Your presence in the world will be weakened, as will your presence with your intimate partner.\u201d\nSo, the next time you notice yourself \u201cgiving in\u201d to your woman and denying your true purpose to spend time with her, Deida advises that you should stop.\u00a0\n\u201cTell your woman that you love her,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you cannot deny your heart\u2019s purpose. Tell her that you will spend thirty minutes (or some specific time) with her in absolute attention and total presence, but then you must return to carry on your mission.\u201d\nSupposedly, this should work. (Our note: it rarely will).\nEmbrace Both Your Masculinity and Your Woman\u2019s Femininity\nDeida believes that men are women are profoundly different and that the more attuned each of the sexes is to their ancestral and essentially unchangeable yin/yang energy, the more intense and stronger their sexual and spiritual union will be.\nA man who is not embracing his masculine energy (i.e., who spends a lot of time combing his hair and/or buying clothes) opens a vacuum for this kind of energy that must be filled by the woman who, in turn, is thus stimulated to act more manly.\nThe bottom line: the more masculine a man is, the more space he allows his woman to embrace her femininity, and vice versa.\nOwn Your Darkest Desires\n\u201cThe masculine is always seeking release from constraint into freedom,\u201d says Deida, which is why a man must always be ready to own his darkest desires. Without doing this, he is purposefully limiting his freedom, which, as we said above is possibly the basic masculine trait.\nIf you are not free, you\u2019ll never be able to find your life purpose, face your fears and lead a relationship. And without this, you\u2019ll never be the man you \n be and you\u2019ll never give your woman the chance to see the best version of you.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Way of the Superior Man Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nIn essence, \nclaims that a man should be more masculine and a woman more feminine if their goal is a spiritually and sexually stimulating union.\u00a0\nAnd even though, in its latest edition, Deida tries to be a bit more politically correct, he generalizes just too many things related to sex and gender to achieve something more than a repackaged and diluted version of some of manosphere\u2019s main tenets.As poetic as it is unscientific, we can see how \ncan be enjoyed by many people and helpful to at least half of them (the men), but, for lack of a better phrase, it is simply not our cup of tea.\n\n"},

Sure, you have! But have you ever wondered whether what you did during a personal crisis of yours can be applied to a nation in crisis?\nWell, American polymath Jared Diamond has, and he thinks the answer to the previous question is \u201cyes.\u201d Allow him to make his argument in the majestic, \u201ccomparative, narrative, exploratory study of crisis and selective change\u201d that is:\nWho Should Read \u201cUpheaval\u201d? And Why?\nIf you are a history buff or a student of political science, then \nhas everything you might want to find in a book: wars, crises, sadistic dictatorships, economic policies, the building of new nations.\nBut then again, it\u2019s a Jared Diamond book, so that\u2019s all but a given once you see his name on the cover. The only thing that\u2019s left for you is to enjoy.\nAbout Jared Diamond\n is an American polymath\u2014geographer, biologist, anthropologist, physiologist\u2014and the author of several immensely popular science books, such as \n,\n, and\nA professor of geography at UCLA, he is one of the most respected public intellectuals in the world, recently ranked the 9\n most influential public intellectual in a joint poll by \u201cProspect\u201d and \u201cForeign Policy.\u201d\nFind out more at \n\u201cUpheaval PDF Summary\u201d\n\u201cAt one or more times during our lives,\u201d writes Jared Diamond at the beginning of the \u201cPrologue\u201d to \n, \u201cmost of us undergo a personal upheaval or crisis, which may or may not get resolved successfully through our making personal changes.\u201d\n\u201cSimilarly,\u201d he adds instantly, \u201cnations undergo national crises, which also may or may not get resolved successfully through national changes. There is a large body of research and anecdotal information, built up by therapists, about the resolution of personal crises. Could the resulting conclusions help us understand the resolution of national crises?\u201d\nAnd that is what \nis all about.\nTo use Diamond\u2019s beautiful description, it is \u201ca comparative, narrative, exploratory study of crisis and selective change operating over many decades in seven modern nations\u2026 and viewed from the perspective of selective change in personal crises. Those nations are Finland, Japan, Chile, Indonesia, Germany, Australia, and the United States.\u201d\nJust look at a map of the world, and you\u2019ll understand why these are the nations Diamond chose: in addition to having much personal experience with all of them, they also cover many distinctly different cultures and are located on all sides of the world.\nBut before devoting the rest of his book to national crises, Diamond reserves the introductory chapter for personal crises, believing that the factors which influence the likelihood of a personal crisis being successfully resolved have their parallels as far as the outcomes of national crises are concerned.\nSo, let\u2019s start there.\nPart 1: The 12 Factors Related to the Outcomes of Personal and National Crises\nPersonal crises are inevitable.\nWhether sudden or gradual, whether in adolescence or after retirement, you must have experienced at least one.\nAnd since everybody has, therapists have spent a lot of time analyzing their genealogy, their possible extent, and the ways one can overcome them. During this research, they have identified \u201cat least a dozen factors,\u201d which suggest whether an individual will or won\u2019t succeed in resolving a personal crisis.\nThese 12 factors are the following ones:\n1. Acknowledgment that one is in crisis\n2. Acceptance of one\u2019s personal responsibility to do something\n3. Building a fence, to delineate one\u2019s individual problems needing to be solved\n4. Getting material and emotional help from other individuals and groups\n5. Using other individuals as models of how to solve problems\n6. Ego strength\n7. Honest self-appraisal\n8. Experience of previous personal crises\n9. Patience\n10. Flexible personality\n11. Individual core values\n12. Freedom from personal constraints\nMost of the factors on the list above have \u201crecognizable analogues\u201d in the case of national crises (1-5 and 7-8), two are less specifically linked (9 and 12) and in the cases of three (6, 10 and 11), the individual factor serves just as a metaphor suggesting a factor describing nations.\nConsequently, the 12 factors which Diamond believes are related to the outcomes of national crises are as follows:\n1. National consensus that one\u2019s nation is in crisis\n2. Acceptance of national responsibility to do something\n3. Building a fence, to delineate the national problems needing to be solved\n4. Getting material and financial help from other nations\n5. Using other nations as models of how to solve the problems\n6. National identity\n7. Honest national self-appraisal\n8. Historical experience of previous national crises\n9. Dealing with national failure\n10. Situation-specific national flexibility\n11. National core values\n12. Freedom from geopolitical constraints\nIt is through these factors that Diamond is interested in analyzing several 20\n-century crises (mostly) he was able to observe in person and in real-time; he dedicates the second part (i.e., most of his book) to these. The same holds true for our summary.\nPart 2: National Crises\nAs you probably know, Finland is a Scandinavian country of about 6 million people which borders Sweden to the west and Russia to the east. We\u2019ll be very surprised if you know something more than this, however: Finland wasn\u2019t even a free country for most of history.\nFrom the 13\n to the 19\n century it was considered a part of Sweden, but after 1809, it became a part of Russia. It remained so for the next century: during the Russian Revolution of 1917, fed up with an oppressive governor set by the Russian Tsar Nicholas II, Finland decided it has had enough and proclaimed its independence.\nUnfortunately, being a small and rather undeveloped country located next to the biggest country in the world was a sure recipe for problems. And they got even bigger after the newly independent Finland became a liberal capitalist democracy, and the USSR the first communist country in the world.\nAll hell broke loose when Stalin became the President of the Soviet Union due to the very simple fact that he didn\u2019t know what the words \u201ccompromise\u201d or \u201cnegotiation\u201d mean.\u00a0\nIt started that way, though: stating security reasons (defending Leningrad), the Soviets asked for some Finnish territories (in exchange for others), and, when Finland refused, on November 30, 1939, just three months after World War II had started, Stalin ordered an invasion of Finland.\u00a0\nThe event triggered what is generally known as the Winter War, a military conflict which officially lasted until March 13, 1940, and unofficially it went on throughout the war.\nUSSR, of course, won the Winter War, but, due to very smart tactics employed by the Finnish volunteers (camouflage, snipers, Molotov cocktails and machine guns), it suffered heavy losses (8 Soviet soldiers killed for every Finnish one), not to mention the bulk of its still fragile international reputation.\nThe most controversial tactic the Finns employed, however, was allying with the Nazis, hoping the Germans would help them defend from Soviet attacks.\nThey realized soon after that the Germans are not precisely the best ally one can have and started finally realizing that their crisis stems from a factor they can do nothing about: geography.\nSo, they smartly started building a fence to delineate the problems and think about solutions and adapted a new stance toward the Soviet Union to overcome the crisis once and for all.\nFor one, they declined to support the German troops in Leningrad\u2014possibly a turning point not only in the Battle of Leningrad, but in the Second World War altogether. Of course, this was appreciated by everyone (including Stalin), so the Soviet planes started deliberately missing Finnish targets, dropping their bombs in Finnish waters.\nHowever, since Finland was on the losing side after the war, it was still required that it pays $300 million to the USSR in reparations\u2014in little over half a decade.\nThe Finns, true to Churchill\u2019s adage to never let a good crisis go to waste, started looking at their crisis differently, using it to industrialize themselves and develop trading connections with everybody\u2014above all, with the Soviet Union.\nThey also agreed to not talk ill of anything bad happening in the USSR, but self-censorship is not that bad a price to pay for earning your independence and developing a prosperous country on the very border of a mighty enemy.\nAfter all, that\u2019s how selective change works: you do what you can to achieve the necessary (good neighborly relations) and accept what you can\u2019t change (the neighbor) even if it means sacrificing a bit of your former self.\nToday, Japan is considered one of the great powers of the world, its economy being the world\u2019s third-largest by GDP and fourth-largest by purchasing power parity.\nHowever, up until the second half of the 19\n century, it was a feudal society, almost completely isolated from the world and uninterested in becoming a part of the modern technological processes.\nAnd then, just like the USSR did in the case of Finland, the US forced Japan to modernize and become the country it is today.\nIt all started with the US discovering gold in California. As a result, it needed new ports to refuel its boats along their Pacific Ocean trading routes. US President Millard Fillmore asked for access to some of Japan\u2019s ports in 1853, but he didn\u2019t do it nicely: it was either that or something much worse.\nThough the rulers of Japan weren\u2019t so happy with a deal that practically got them nothing in return, they realized they had to make it, for they were no match to one of the fastest-developing and military most advanced countries in the world.\nHowever, this caused internal crisis: most of the Japanese (especially the Samurai) were against such a deal, so a coup and civil war followed. It resulted in what is today known as the Meiji era, a period of forty or so years during which Japan evolved from a feudal society to a modern, industrialized nation, and became one of the world\u2019s emergent great power.\nWait a minute, you say! But wasn\u2019t the coup \n this?\nYes, it was. But, as soon as they were installed, the new leaders realized that Japan risks being colonized by European superpowers unless it becomes a superpower itself.\nThus, Japan made the first step toward overcoming its crisis: acknowledging its situation and performing an honest-self \n. Now, was the time for selective changes.\nTrue to the 12-step therapeutic program, Japan took other countries as role models: Germany for its constitution and army, Britain for its military ships and its navy.\nHowever, they didn\u2019t change entirely: they accepted many elements from the Western societies they were trying to emulate, but they remained true to most of their traditions, creating a unique blend of Asian patience and self-sacrificing character with a Western thirst for freedom and individualism.\nThe result?\nThey defeated the Russians during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 and announced to the world that they are a force to be reckoned with.\nTrue, Russia was ruled ineffectively by Tsar Nicholas and was all but a feudal state, but this was, after all, the first victory of an Asian power over a European enemy.\nUnlike most of the South American countries, Chile was a democratic nation for most of its existence. Ever since 1925, the country\u2019s voting system prevented any of its three parties (left, centrist, and right) from taking total control.\nIt was so in 1970 as well, when Marxist Salvador Allende was chosen to be the President with about 36 percent of the vote. Even though\u2014to quote a Chilean friend of Diamond\u2014he had good ideas, Allende executed them poorly, adopting wrong solutions to the problems in question.\nMost importantly, Allende ignored the fact that only a third of the Chilean voters gave him support, and that mighty powers (such as the Chilean armed forces, the Chilean capitalists, and, most importantly, the United States government) were among the two-thirds who were against him.\nYet, he nationalized US-owned copper companies, froze prices, replaced free-market elements of Chile\u2019s economy with socialist-style state planning, granted big wage increases, greatly increased government spending, and printed paper money to cover the resulting government deficits.\nThe result?\nPolarization of the political climate which brought an end to Chile\u2019s democracy and installed a dictator in Allende\u2019s place who was either murdered or committed suicide.\nThis is how Diamond sums up the situation:\nBelieve it or not, even though Chile\u2019s democracy turned into a sadistic dictatorship in the span of just a few years, Pinochet\u2019s decision to turn over the economy to \n and the Chicago Boys was very beneficial in the long run.\nTrue, Chile never re-privatized the copper mines (still responsible for 10% of Chile\u2019s GDP), but everything else was left to the free market to decide. They decided that Chile will become the country with the highest GINI coefficient (meaning: wealth still isn\u2019t distributed well in Chile), but also one of the most developed countries in the world.\nWhy would a dictator choose free-market policies remains unclear to this day. But Pinochet\u2019s choice ultimately resulted in the stabilization of the Chilean society and the overcoming of its worst crisis.\nPretty much the same thing that happened in Chile during the 1970s happened on the other side of the world in the newly-created Indonesia.\nRuled by a left-leaning president ever since its foundation in 1945, Indonesia was hit by a very confusing crisis on September 30, 1965, when a communist faction of the army was blamed for the death of six supposedly corrupt generals.\nWhether there was a communist plan to kill these generals remains uncertain to this very day, but it is quite possible that it was all a ploy by one of the army\u2019s mightiest generals, Suharto, because, just like in Nazi Germany in 1933, as soon as the ploy became public, he ordered the extermination of the communist element in Indonesia.\nAnd, just like under Pinochet\u2019s rule in Chile, that\u2019s precisely what happened under Suharto\u2019s rule: between half a million and two million communist supporters were killed by people who are now deemed liberators of the country (if you haven\u2019t, watch the brilliant documentary, \n, for more).\nSuharto, as brutal and sadistic as he was, did employ a set of more moderate measures to fix Indonesia\u2019s economy. Under the previous president, Sukarno, Indonesia aligned with China, but its economy was in shambles. Now it started making connections with the Western world. Unsurprisingly, Suharto too had his Chicago Boys. His economic team was dubbed, less courteously, the Berkeley Mafia.\nUsing foreign role models, the Berkeley Mafia successfully reduced Indonesia\u2019s foreign debt and inflation, while balancing its budget, making the country a powerful international trading partner and global ideological player.\nOnce again, it was selective change by way of foreign role models that did the trick\u2014even in the face of corruption and tyranny. Once again, a severe crisis was successfully overcome by using the knowledge garnered through similar experiences at some other places.\nIn 1945, Germany was not only covered in ruins, but it was also divided in half. There was a reason for this, of course: the Allies believed that only a divided Germany would be unable to industrialize quickly and start another war.\nHowever, just a few years after the war had ended, it was more than obvious to the United States that this was a risk it was willing to take because it was far more dangerous to leave the Soviet Union to expand its influence across Europe.\nSo, West Germany became part of the Marshall Plan, an American initiative to rebuild European economies after the war so that it can prevent the spread of communism.\nThe plan worked like a charm: from a country set back at least half a century, West Germany became the most highly developed European nation. It introduced a powerful new currency (the Deutsche Mark) and joined the free market both as one of the world\u2019s topmost exporters and importers of goods.\nWhen Willy Brandt became West Germany\u2019s first left-wing chancellor, things took a turn for the better.\u00a0\nThe reason?\nBrandt was ready to stop playing the role of a victim, and accept responsibility for Germany\u2019s past sins. He apologized to neighboring countries and asked even Eastern bloc nations for forgiveness. At the same type, he supported American policies (including the Vietnam War) and was patient and flexible as far as the story of Germany\u2019s reunification was concerned.\nEventually, in 1989, this happened, but it owes a lot to Brandt and the policies enacted during his reign.\nAfter the end of the Second World War, Australia faced one of the strangest crises a country can ever face.\u00a0\nYou see, unlike Finland or Japan, Australia wasn\u2019t interested in becoming an independent nation; on the contrary: it wanted to be part of the British Empire.\nThe problem was that the British Empire didn\u2019t want to bother with Australia anymore. It simply disowned the country during the 1950s, reducing its military presence and opting to focus its trading interests on mainland Europe.\nThe Australians begged and begged and then realized that they have only themselves to rely on from now on. They couldn\u2019t influence Britain\u2019s decision, but they were able to do something about it. This was the first honest self-assessment of Australia.\nIt yielded some good results\u2014the country started developing\u2014but also some disastrous outcomes\u2014its immigration minister, Arthur Calwell, was openly racist and was interested in accepting only white immigrants.\nIn 1972, when finally the Labor Party won, Australia made another honest assessment of itself and realized that it has to selectively change and become a country of its own.\nFirst of all, since Britain was so far away, it had to improve its relations with its immediate neighbors, most importantly China. It also had to change its immigration policies and start accepting everyone: it needed people, and it needed them now. Finally, it needed to enact a policy of equal pay for women\u2014for hundreds of obvious reasons.\nThe best example of selective change happened in 1999, when Australia finally recognized Britain as a foreign country, while symbolically still pledging allegiance to England\u2019s Queen.\nIt lost something but not everything; and as it happens in the case of overcoming crises, what it lost was actually a gain in the long run.\nPart 3: Nations and the World\nIn the third part, Diamond applies the lessons learned from the six crises described above to the current state of affairs in the United States and the world.\nTrue, he says, just like Chile, Japan or Australia, \n, and it is difficult to apply the lessons from other countries to one that has a pretty exceptional development, but he warns that many symptoms are there and that we must be careful lest we want to be mangled by a crisis of unforeseen proportions.\nFor, just like Chile, the United States is nowadays \n: for the first time in sixty years or so, people are severely divided along many lines\u2014politically even more so than otherwise. In the absence of compromise, democracy is the first thing that suffers, so \n.\nIt couldn\u2019t happen here?\nWell, that was the same thing Chileans thought until the beginning of the 1970s; and then they became a sadistic dictatorship.\nAnother thing which suggests that things are not going in the right direction in the US is the fact that, after the African-Americans were given the right to vote in the 1960s, governments are continually subverting people\u2019s right to vote.\nFor example, the voter ID law requires every voter to have a current and valid photo ID to vote. However, in Texas, there are so few places which issue IDs or driver\u2019s licenses that some people have to travel hundreds of miles to reach them.\nEven worse, they work only during working hours, practically disqualifying the poorest people who can\u2019t take a day off to travel to the nearest DMV.\n is another thing the US doesn\u2019t care one bit about, even though it is a scientific consensus that it is happening, and that its results may be devastating.\nFor compassion, even though reducing consumption is a good way to tackle this problem, the US consumes twice the amount of oil per capita when compared to Western Europe, even though the quality of life is generally higher on the other side of the Atlantic.\nEven scarier, it recently opted out of the Paris Agreement.\nDiamond warns: there are some issues which should not be left to the countries to solve but should be solved on an international, global level.\nAs Colin Kidd from \nwrites, \u201cthe prophet spares us chiseled commandments, but we have been warned.\u201d\nIndeed, we have.\nKey Lessons from \u201cUpheaval\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Individuals and Nations Have One Thing in Common: The Way They Overcome Crises\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Overcoming Crisis Is All About Selective Changing\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Other Nations\u2019 Past Crises Can Teach Us a Lot About Current Problems\nIndividuals and Nations Have One Thing in Common: The Way They Overcome Crises\nAlmost all people, at a certain age or time (adolescence, the loss of a loved one, job loss, retirement, widowing, etc.) are bound to face a crisis. Be it internal (say, becoming sick) or external (being deserted by a spouse), an individual must \n to some extent to overcome this crisis.\nTherapists have developed \u201ca road-map of a dozen factors that help us to understand the varying outcomes\u201d of an individual crisis. Interestingly enough, the same 12 factors seem applicable in the case of nations in crises.\nOvercoming Crisis Is All About Selective Changing\nNow, as we said above, an individual or a nation must \nto some extent to overcome a crisis. However, the keyword in Jared Diamond\u2019s book is \u201cselective.\u201d\u00a0\nHe writes:\nOther Nations\u2019 Past Crises Can Teach Us a Lot About Current World Problems\nIn \nDiamond analyzes six 20\n century crises: Finland\u2019s Winter War with the USSR, the birth of Modern Japan during the Meiji era, the Allende/Pinochet years in Chile, the Sukarno/Suharto switch in Indonesia, Germany after the War, and Britain-less Australia of the second half of the past century.\nThe reason why he does this is quite simple: he believes that through these case studies we can learn not only the ways in which a country can overcome a crisis but also the problems the world is facing nowadays.\nA comparison with Chile of the 1970s, for example, reveals that the US may become a totalitarian country as well\u2014if we are not careful.\nAnd that\u2019s a Jared Diamond warning.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cUpheaval Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nThough \nis as across-the-board and all-embracing as \n, it is much less rigorous and much more personal.

If so, be ready for a treat!\nJoseph Murphy expands on his theory that \u201cthat the latent powers inherent in our subconscious can improve our lives\u201d in yet another book:\n.\nWho Should Read \u201cThe Miracles of Your Mind\u201d? And Why?\n\u201cWhether you wish to conquer a bad habit, be more successful, obtain harmony in your family, or achieve goals that have thus far been unattainable,\u201d says the blurb of \n,\nthis book\nwill give you \u201cguidelines to put you on the right path.\u201d\nRead it if you can suspend your disbelief, though, and you are not a scientific person. Because there are no arguments or cited studies here, and most of the claims are yet to be proven by science.\nAbout Joseph Murphy\n was an Irish-born American bestselling author and one of the leaders of the New Thought and the Human Potential movement.\nA Roman Catholic, he traveled to India in his thirties and soon after formed a new church in America influenced by Hindu ideology. Later, he became the minister of the Los Angeles Divine Science Church in 1949, which, under his leadership, became one of the largest New Thought congregations in the United States.\nHe published his first book in 1945 (at the age of 47), but wrote a lot of books afterward. Published in 1963, \nis still considered a New Thought classic.\n\u201cThe Miracles of Your Mind PDF Summary\u201d\nPublished in 1953, \nis perhaps Joseph Murphy\u2019s second best-known book, \nbeing the other.\nWe\u2019d hate to disappoint you, but the main ideas of both are pretty the same: there are two parts of your brain, and one of them (the subconscious mind) has the tools to control the other (the conscious mind). By tapping into the power of your subconscious mind, you will be able to perform feats and endeavors science refers to as miracles, and the New Thought movement deems ancient knowledge.\nThough in \na fairly short book (about 100 pages)\u2014Joseph Murphy lists fewer real-life examples than in \n, he does offer more practical and actionable bits of advice, mostly 1-2-3 techniques to overcome a bad habit or achieve a certain goal.\nAs he says in the second chapter of the book, his purpose is \u201cto remove the mystery of the workings of the mind, in order to know better its \n.\u201d\u00a0\nAs always, it is our purpose to remove the mystery of his book and pack it up in a neat summary.\nSo, what are we waiting for?\nHow Your Mind Works\n\u201cMan has only one mind, but he has two distinct phases or functions of the one mind\u201d\u2014that\u2019s the introductory sentence of Murphy\u2019s \n.\nIf it sounds familiar to you, that\u2019s because it is: it is very similar to the opening sentence of the third chapter of William Walker Atkinson\u2019 \n\u201cMan has but one mind, but he has many mental faculties, each faculty being capable of functioning along two different lines of mental effort.\u201d\nThis should surprise nobody since the philosophy underlying both books is one and the same. Only the terms are somewhere different.\nFor Atkinson, the two states of the mind were the active and the passive. For Murphy, they are the objective and the subjective mind (though he says that they can also be called the conscious and the subconscious mind\u2014we\u2019ll use this dichotomy the most\u2014the waking and the sleeping mind, the male and the female mind, the voluntary and the involuntary mind, etc. etc.)\nThe objective mind is the one which deals with \n things and uses the five physical senses to know the world. The subjective mind, on the other hand, perceives by intuition and is the seat of your emotions.\nConsequently, while the objective mind is limited by the physical aspects of your existence, the subjective mind can leave the body, travel to distant lands, bring back intelligence from across space and time, and even read the contents of sealed envelopes and closed safes.\nOne other thing: the subjective mind is very susceptible to suggestions and, in one way or another, says yes to \n of them. It is much like the soil: it will accept any seed you plant in it, be it good or bad. That makes your conscious mind the boss of it, even though the subconscious mind is by far the more powerful of the two:\nThe conscious and the subconscious mind are connected in an inverse proportion: the more one of them is used, the less the other contributes. That\u2019s why the subconscious mind \u201cperforms its highest functions when the objective senses are in abeyance\u2026 when the conscious mind is suspended or in a sleepy, drowsy state.\u201d\nAnd, boy, what functions are these!\nHow the Subconscious Mind Can Help You\nWhat we summed up above is the introductory\u2014let\u2019s just say, \n\u2014chapter of \n. It is, by far, the most important chapter of the book since it outlines the underlying philosophy not just behind it, but also behind everything Murphy ever wrote.\nThe rest of the book consists of (about ten-page) chapters (six, in all) where the knowledge laid down at the beginning is translated into practical techniques which should help you achieve specific things, such as health (this is the longest chapter in the book), wealth and marital peace, as well as offer you guidance on overcoming bad habits and teething troubles such as alcoholism and fear.\nLet\u2019s speed-read through these chapters, focusing mainly on the techniques Murphy reveals and describes.\nAs far as Murphy is concerned, there is one\u2014and only one\u2014\n: namely, the subconscious mind. There is also one\u2014and only one\u2014process of healing: faith. The equation between the two is quite simple: sincerely and naively believe that you can heal yourself, and your subconscious mind will believe you and do the rest of the work.\u00a0\nThis knowledge is not new, Murphy says, referring us to Paracelsus, a 16\n century alchemist, and quoting twice a belief of his: \u201cWhether the object of your faith be true or false, you will nevertheless obtain the same effects.\u201d\u00a0\nIn other words, \u201cif you believe in the bones of saints to heal, or if you believe in the healing power of certain waters, you \n get results, because of the powerful suggestion given to your subconscious mind; it is the latter that does the healing. The witch doctor with his incantations heals by faith also.\u201d\nIt would be, of course, too easy if you could just say \u201cI have no headache,\u201d and you stopped having headaches for the rest of your life. True, you \n the boss of your subconscious mind, but tyrants are never liked by their subordinates. Also, your subconscious mind doesn\u2019t accept contradictions that easily; it accepts only what you believe and feel as true or possible.\nSo, what you want to do is impress your subconscious mind into cooperation; in plainer words, you need to \n him the idea that you have no headache. As a friend of Murphy realized, though the affirmation \u201cI have no headache\u201d doesn\u2019t work, the declaration \u201cIt is passing away\u201d \n.\nEspecially if uttered before going to sleep or in a drowsy, reverie-like state when the conscious mind gives way to the subjective part of your being, and your subconscious mind takes over.\nHowever, don\u2019t ever weaken your treatment by saying things such as \u201cI hope so,\u201d or \u201cIt will be better.\u201d As Murphy says, \u201cthe cellular set-up of your body will follow faithfully and honestly whatever blueprint the conscious mind hands over to them via the subconscious mind.\u201d\u00a0\nDoubt and hope are not your friends. Even worse than they are fear, hate, guilt, and inferiority\u2014the \u201cfour basic personality difficulties\u2026 at the root of everything that goes wrong in the subconscious mind.\u201d\nShow them who is \u201cthe boss\u201d by carefully balancing out your pitch to the subconscious mind. \u201cKnow that health is yours!\u201d shouts Murphy. \u201cHarmony is yours! Become intelligent by becoming a vehicle for the infinite, healing power of the subconscious mind.\u201d\nRegardless of the problem, the usual procedure to contact your subconscious mind and order him to do something consists of three steps:\n#1. Take a look at the problem.\n#2. Turn to the solution or way out known only to the subconscious mind (talk to it in a reverie-like state, without doubt or fear)\n#3. Rest in a sense of deep conviction that it is done.\nMurphy advises that you use this technique with \u201ccomplete simplicity and naivet\u00e9,\u201d \u201cAs a man imagines and feels, so is he,\u201d says an ancient proverb, and Murphy claims that in these few words all of the knowledge a man needs to lead a happy life lies buried.\nIf you are an alcoholic\u2014since, \n, \u201cthe opposite of addiction isn\u2019t sobriety: it\u2019s connection\u201d\u2014Murphy suggests a subtly updated technique, one inspired by Goethe\u2019s practice of having \u201cimaginary, mental conversations\u201d with his absent friends:\n#1. Get still and quite the wheels of your mind. Enter into a sleepy, drowsy state.\n#2. Use a trick out of the Nancy School hypnosis-centered toolbox: \u201ctake a brief phrase which can readily be graven on the memory, and repeat it over and over again as a lullaby.\u201d Murphy suggests the following phrase: \u201cSobriety and peace of mind are mine now, and I give thanks.\u201d\u00a0\nSo, that you prevent your mind from wandering, you should repeat this phrase for five minutes, either aloud or \u201csketch its pronunciation with lips and tongue as you say it mentally.\u201d\n#3. Just before going to sleep, use Goethe\u2019s imagine-a-friend technique.\u00a0\n\u201cImagine a friend,\u201d Murphy advises, \u201ca loved one in front of you. Your eyes are closed; you are relaxed and at peace. The loved one is subjectively present and is saying to you, \u2018Congratulations!\u2019 You see the smile; you hear the voice. You touch the hand and the face; it\u2019s all so real and vivid. The word \u2018congratulations\u2019 implies complete freedom. Hear it, over and over again, until you get the reaction which satisfies.\u201d\n\u201cMoney is essential for your economic health in this country,\u201d states the obvious Murphy; \u201ctherefore, you should have all you need and a surplus.\u201d\nThere are two reasons why you don\u2019t already have that much: either you are constantly thinking to yourself something \u201cfoolish\u201d about money (\u201cI despise money.\u201d \u201cIt is an evil thing.\u201d \u201cIt is the root of all evil.\u201d) or you are ordering your subconscious mind the wrong things (\u201cI need money.\u201d \u201cI want wealth and success.\u201d)\nThe trick is, once again, to find the most suggestible phrase and to repeat it for a few minutes in a drowsy state. In the case of money, Murphy suggests quite a few:\n\u2022 \u201cWealth\u2014Success.\u201d This is the simplest one. Just repeating these two words one after another for about five minutes three or four times a day creates the necessary connections\u2014not just between them, but also between yourself and your subconscious mind, and, finally, your subconscious mind and the world.\n\u2022 \u201cBy day and by night, I am being prospered in all of my interests.\u201d This is even gentler and, as such, it \u201cwill not arouse any argument because it does not contradict the subconscious mind\u2019s impression of financial lack.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cMy sales are improving every day. I am advancing, progressing, and getting wealthier every day.\u201d Hear the happiness inside this sentence? There is no fear, doubt or guilt there. That\u2019s why it should work!\nThe subconscious mind has tremendous power, but it is absolutely pointless to use it when its use would benefit nobody.\nFor example, if one ends up being married to a drug addict, it is not at all wise to try and use your subconscious mind to prolong that marriage (though you can); it is much better to pack your bags and leave\u2014because even if your partner wants the opposite, that marriage is doomed to failure.\n\u201cIf one of the partners has an intense desire to terminate the marriage,\u201d writes Murphy, \u201cand the other has an equally intense desire to remain united in marriage, and they are both sincere\u2026 this is a house divided against itself; sooner or later it will dissolve.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why \u201cthe best time to prevent a divorce is before marriage.\u201d The cause of all of your marital trouble is that you didn\u2019t use your subconscious mind to attract the right wife or husband.\u00a0\nMurphy shares this technique if you want to achieve this:\nYou know how you woke up that time at 5:45 AM without the alarm, and that was precisely the hour you wanted to wake up?\nWell, by now you know what happened: you suggested your subconscious mind to wake you up, and since you did this in a drowsy reverie-like state, the subconscious mind took the reins in its hands and obeyed the order.\nIt\u2019s the same when you need guidance for something. In this case, however, instead of ordering your subconscious mind to do something, just ask it a question before you go to sleep. Your subconscious mind has superior wisdom, and it will give you the answer\u2014sometimes even in your dreams.\nThe technique is still the same. In your bed tonight, quiet your mind, still your body and tell all of yourself to relax. Immobilize your attention and focus all of your thoughts on your problem.\u00a0\nFirst, try and solve it with your conscious mind. Then, think about how happy you\u2019d be when you\u2019ve finally found the solution. Think about nothing else, though: if your mind wanders, bring it back gently.\nFinally, in the sleepiest, drowsiest state before dreams come, say quietly and positively: \u201cThe answer is mine now; I know my subconscious mind knows the answer.\u201d\nFall asleep with the mood or feeling of a found solution. Let your mind play around with this mood in a relaxed manner. Even if you drift away before you go through all of these steps, don\u2019t worry: your subconscious mind will be active in the morning as well.\nJust don\u2019t transfer the problem to your conscious mind: your solution should come when you\u2019re preoccupied with something else.\nRemember: no matter what happens, \u201cyou will always receive guidance with respect to the subject in which you think about the most.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDo the thing you fear,\u201d said Emerson once, \u201cand the death of fear is certain.\u201d What he forgot to mention is that you need not do the thing you fear for real: you can imagine it and do it perfectly in your mind beforehand. Afterward, the subconscious mind will walk you on the right track.\nMurphy tells the story of a singer who was afraid to sing before an audience, even though she had a beautiful voice. He suggested her the technique below and, lo and behold, she became a star. Unfortunately, Murphy doesn\u2019t share with us her name, and we have to take his words at face value.\nAs for the technique.\nThe singer was advised to isolate herself three times a day in a quiet room. Then she was supposed to sit down comfortably in an armchair, relax her body, and close her eyes. \u201cPhysical inertia favors mental passivity,\u201d writes Murphy, \u201cand renders the mind more receptive to suggestion.\u201d\nSo, now, it was time for suggestions. The girl was advised to say to herself something along the lines of \u201cI sing beautifully, I am poised, serene, confident, and calm.\u201d Slowly, quietly, and with a feeling.\nThree such \u201csittings\u201d a day and one immediately before sleep made this woman a star-singer after only a week: she gave a remarkable, wonderful audition and she never felt the fear of being on stage ever again.\n\u201cCarry out the above procedure with assurance and conviction,\u201d concludes Murphy, \u201cand the death of fear is certain.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Miracles of Your Mind\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 Your Mind Has Two Distinct Phases: Objective and Subjective\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 The Subconscious Mind Is Most Powerful When the Conscious Mind Is Switched Off\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 The True Meaning of the Words \u201cHeart\u201d and \u201cLord\u201d\nYour Mind Has Two Distinct Phases: Objective and Subjective\nEven though we have only one mind, it has \u201ctwo distinct phases or functions.\u201d These two functions have many names, but the ones Murphy prefers are objective (or conscious) and subjective (or subconscious).\nThe objective (or the conscious) mind, via our five senses, takes cognizance of the objective world; the subjective, on the other hand, is the seat of our emotions. The former gives orders and is limited by our senses; the latter is susceptible to suggestions and is superior in all aspects to the conscious mind.\u00a0\nThe Subconscious Mind Is Most Powerful When the Conscious Mind Is Switched Off\nJust as the conscious mind works best when you are fresh and active, the subconscious mind works best when you are not, because that\u2019s when the objective function of your brain is suppressed by your body.\nThat\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re drowsy or sleepy (this is when you\u2019re most unable to discern reality from fantasy), so this is the best time to start \n something to your subconscious mind. It is the time when it is most open to listening.\nSo make your pitch to it just before you fall asleep, in the quiet, relaxed, reverie-like state of lethargy.\nThe True Meaning of the Words \u201cHeart\u201d and \u201cLord\u201d\n\u201cThe heart is called the subconscious mind in ancient allegories,\u201d writes Murphy. \u201cThe Egyptians knew that the heart was the subconscious mind, but they did not call it by that name. The Chaldeans and the Babylonians called it by different names.\u201d\nIn addition, in the penultimate chapter of the book, Murphy adds that \u201cthe \n is an ancient word meaning your subconscious mind.\u201d\nIn other words, when you\u2019re talking to your heart or the Lord, you\u2019re actually talking to your subconscious mind.\u00a0\nBut that is not a mistake, because this is how your most intimate wishes actually come true. You just need to believe it\u2014naively and with total dedication. It doesn\u2019t matter what it is: faith opens the path to your subconscious mind, and it answers to many different names.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Miracles of Your Mind Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nMore or less, \ncan be summed up in two sentences, and we really feel that Joseph Murphy is spinning them out in a book so that he can profit from selling it.\nWhich doesn\u2019t mean that he doesn\u2019t believe in his own philosophy. But it does mean that \n don\u2019t: \nseems to us quite unscientific and unempirical\u2014even half-baked (there are so many examples here that we have no way of finding out whether they are invented or not).\nFinally, even though it says it\u2019s practical, there\u2019s really nothing of that sort here: blame us for being conservative if you\u2019d like, but it\u2019s not that practical to expect to become rich by merely thinking about it three times a day. You need to work for it!However, if you appreciate the New Thought and the Human Potential Movement and its advocates, then this is a book you \n to read. It\u2019s a classic, and it will be for many years to come.\n\n"},

And Why?\nIf you want to live a happier, healthier life, but you are tired of ads and magazines that promote unattainable body images, \nis the book for you.\nPrimarily intended for women, it can be read by men as well, mainly because it repeatedly insists on finding ways to inspire the readers to make their own programs.\nCoaches and nutritionists should find something interesting here as well.\nAbout Rebecca Scritchfield\n is a certified health and fitness specialist, registered dietitian nutritionist, and a renowned well-being coach.\nShe has regularly appeared on TV (\n, CNN, the \n show) and has written/been interviewed for newspapers (\n, \n, \n, \n), but \nis her first book.\nYou can find out more about it at \n.\u00a0\n\u201cBody Kindness PDF Summary\u201d\nDiets, exercising, supplements\u2026 They are, undeniably, all good for your looks, physical health, and your overall fitness if you want to \n, but how good are they for your mental health?\nRebecca Scritchfield thinks that, in the case of too many people, when all is taken into account, they do more harm than good, simply because, just like everything else in this world, our bodies crave for \n.\nAnd that word is the key one in the question that opens Scritchfield\u2019s most celebrated book and underlies her whole philosophy: \u201cwhat would you do if you treated your body with kindness?\u201d\nPause for a moment here and try to answer this question in a thought-out and honest manner.\nDone that?\nNow, you can proceed.\nThe Philosophy of Body Kindness\nAs you might have guessed, Scritchfield frequently poses the question above to her clients, colleagues, friends, family, and anyone else willing to ponder it.\nAnd according to her, in the span of many years, nobody has ever said that \u201cdoing punishing workout to alleviate cheesecake guilt is a good example of proper self-care.\u201d\u00a0\nWe guess nobody says that eating a bag of nacho cheese Doritos every night can be classified as body kindness as well.\nWhich brings us to one very important conclusion: \u201ceveryone has a gut instinct for how to be kind to their body.\u201d The reason is quite simple: \n to notice when things are not going as planned.\nYou can lie to yourself as much as you want to, but the truth is you know full well when you\u2019re unkind to your body. And the body, we don\u2019t need to remind you, \nforgets.\nUnfortunately, what people often forget is that being healthy is not the same as being fit. It can be, but not necessarily. You can have cellulite and thick thighs and be healthy nevertheless.\nAlso, being \n healthy is only a part of the equation. If diets make you anxious and angry, then you\u2019re only caring for half of your health. Emotional health is a very important part of the \u201cbeing well\u201d equation.\nWhy do we ignore it so much?\nWell, this is the essence of the philosophy of body kindness: dieting and exercising are not ways to achieve the perfect body, but tools that should help you feel good about yourself:\nThe Three Pillars and the Three Objectives of Body Kindness\nMany women are slaves to the \u201cjoyless myth\u201d that unless they like what they see in the mirror, they can never be happy.\nConsequently, the only reason why they work out or diet is precisely that: to obtain a body like those magazine models everyone talks about\u2014\n \n (and this is the scary part) they have quite healthy and happy lives with the bodies they have before.\nThe \n of the body kindness movement aim to change this. All of them are verbs meant to serve as guideposts on one\u2019s journey to better health and happiness:\n \n\u201cHealth grows from love,\u201d\nwrites\nScritchfield. The very reason why you know you\u2019re not doing a good thing munching ice-cream in bed is because you know, under the surface, that you are built and willing to love yourself. Cherish and develop this love.\u00a0\nWhen you notice a friend torturing herself through dieting and exercising, your instinct is to tell her that she needs to stop doing that to herself. Well, start connecting to yourself like you are to your friends, and allow your body to guide your choices.\nYou express love and connection through caring. Show your body that you care. Act in a way that\u2019s quietly saying: \u201cWe\u2019re in this together. I\u2019m your friend, not your enemy.\u201d\nDedicated to shattering the mirror-myth mentioned at the beginning of this section, the Body kindness program (let\u2019s call it that way, even though it\u2019s not that strict) sets before itself \n:\n \n \u201cYou are free to make your own choices instead of following meaningless rules,\u201d writes Scritchfield. \u201cYou can stop overthinking and use your energy for interests other than preconceived notions of health and appearance.\u201d\n. If the organs inside your body start warring between themselves, you wouldn\u2019t be able to function properly, to say the least. Then why are you waging war against them, against your body, against yourself? End it. Start living more authentically.\n. People who are insecure follow trends. People who are confident make up their own rules. Being kind to your body will empower you to set yourself profound and meaningful goals, because, after all, you are in charge of your life.\nFood Rules Suck: Eating with Body Kindness\nNow that we\u2019ve gone over the theory, let\u2019s see how body kindness works in practice. Unsurprisingly, diets are the best place to start: it\u2019s a billion-dollar industry, and it affects just about every woman you know (and don\u2019t know).\nBut here\u2019s the catch: since it doesn\u2019t take mental and emotional health in the equation, dieting, by definition, is based on a paradox.\nAnd (as you know from 80% of the people who\u2019ve tried it) it rarely works.\nIt\u2019s true that some nourishments are healthier than others and that some don\u2019t even deserve to be called that way because they are nothing more than junk food.\nThe problem is that trying to avoid the ones that are unhealthy for you usually results in so much anxiety and repressed emotions that, by trying to fix your physical health, you\u2019re ruining your mental and emotional health.\nAnd it\u2019s not only that the ones who are anxious are unhappy; it\u2019s also that the unhappy cannot keep up long with a routine.\u00a0\nSo, to sum up: by being overly controlling of what you eat and what you don\u2019t you do get better physically in the short run; but you also get anxious and unhappy, which, in the long run, backfires even in the physical department.\nYup, we\u2019re talking about the day when, after two months of avoiding cupcakes, you ate a whole box of them!\nThere\u2019s a simple way out: balance things out.\nStop following strict rules and allow yourself moderate indulgence once a day. Don\u2019t just give up bread altogether: start eating bread more rarely.\nIt\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint. You\u2019re in it for the long run.\nFitness for \nLife: Choose What Works for You\nThere are thousands of exercising regimes you can find online or in any of the thousands of magazines dedicated to fitness and health. The problem is, most of them don\u2019t work. Or, to be more precise, most of them \n.\nNow, don\u2019t get us wrong: exercising is very good for you and your health. In fact, it\u2019s one of the best ways to express kindness to your body.\nWhether you\u2019re fighting depression or diabetes, or you simply want to reduce the risk of severe diseases such as cancer or heart disease, exercising does wonders.\nThe problem is very few people actually exercise.\nThe stats say that the average American moves about for no more than 20 minutes a day and that a third of Americans exercises once a week \n.\nThe reason why this is so despite the benefits of regular exercise is that it is difficult to find the motivation to work out in a world where every second counts. Especially since the \n benefits of exercising can only become evident in the long run.\nSo, Rebecca Scritchfield advises you to do four things.\nFirst of all, you\u2019ll need to throw away all those fitness magazines and stop comparing yourself to Victoria\u2019s Secret models. Chances are you\u2019ll never live up to these images, and unachievable goals demotivate.\nSecondly, you need to find the right motivation. Maybe this one will do: exercising a little every day may not chisel you into a Kardashian or a Beyonc\u00e9, but it will undoubtedly help you feel better and live longer.\nThirdly, you need to find a friend or a coach. We sometimes need external motivation and friends and coaches are just that (remember: connect). You don\u2019t need a coach to get great (\n): you need it to get a routine.\nFinally, just like with dieting, you need to find a program that works for you. Don\u2019t do things you can do only for a day. Do things you\u2019re ready to do for life. Because, after all, it is \nSleep: The Secret Superpower for Spiraling Up\nArianna Huffington practically stopped doing everything she was doing a few years ago to warn the world that it needs a little rest, and to start something she deemed a \n.\nShe was on track: the majority of people, unfortunately, do not get enough sleep on a daily basis. The effects are frightening\u2014especially in the long run.\nScience is still unsure as to why we sleep (let alone dream), but it has the general idea. If nothing more, it is quite sure that it has something to do with memory and learning, because studies have repeatedly shown that people deprived of enough sleep memorize (and know) less than people who get a good eight-hour sleep.\nIt could be that sleep works as a sort of a \u201csave and declutter\u201d button on our bodies. Just think how much easier it is to live in your apartment when your dishes are done, when your clothes are in the wardroom, and when everything else is in its place.\u00a0\nWell, in a way, sleep is your body\u2019s \n: it sparks joy.\nNow, there are \n, and some (not more than 5% though) can function perfectly even after a 6-hour sleep. Most of us, however, are genetically predisposed to sleep about 8 hours or four 2-hour sleep cycles.\nTo achieve this, you need to do a few things.\nFirst of all, turn your bedroom into a \u201csleeping sanctuary.\u201d That means no TV, no laptops, and no smartphones. It may be difficult at first, but you\u2019ll get used to it. Do it long enough, and sometime in the future, you\u2019ll thank Scritchfield for suggesting this.\nSecondly, make sure that your bed is clean, comfortable, and always ready to take you in. That means: \n, wash your sheets regularly, and invest in a good mattress.\nFinally, make your own sleep routine. Go to bed at a certain hour of the night (about one hour after using an electronic device for the last time), and learn to wake up eight hours after that. Your body wants that and, as proof, after some time, you won\u2019t need an alarm to wake up.\u00a0\nAnd you\u2019ll wake up refreshed and ready to conquer the world\u2014on a daily basis.\nThat\u2019s how our body rewards for being kind to it.\nKey Lessons from \u201cBody Kindness\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Philosophy of Body Kindness\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Three Pillars and the Three Objectives of Body Kindness\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Four Principles of Body Kindness\nThe Philosophy of Body Kindness\nAccording to Rebecca Scritchfield (masochists aside, we suppose?), each of us has an instinctive urge to be kind to his/her body. That is why we can\u2019t bear dieting or exercise following strict regimes. They may help us physically, but they ruin us mentally and emotionally, and that is even unhealthier.\nThat is the essence of the \u201cbody kindness\u201d philosophy: be kind to your body if you want your body to be kind to you.\nThe Three Pillars and the Three Objectives of Body Kindness\nThe philosophy of body kindness is founded on three actionable pillars.\nFirst of all, you need to nurture the innate love you have for your body. Secondly, you need to connect to it as if it is your best friend. Finally, you need to care for it just like you would for your best friend whom you love so much.\nDo this long enough, and you\u2019ll achieve the three objectives of the \u201cbody kindness\u201d program.\nFirst of all, you\u2019ll be free from the burden of \u201cthe image in the mirror.\u201d This will allow you to be peaceful and happier. Finally, it will contribute to you being a much more confident person, and that is the final step toward breaking the \u201cfollow this/follow that rule\u201d cycle.\nThe Four Principles of Body Kindness\nThe full body kindness program is based on four principles:\n\u2022 \n: what you eat, how you exercise, how much you sleep;\n\u2022 \n: befriending your emotions and shushing down the voice in your head;\n\u2022 \n: what are your goals and your personal values and how do they align; and\n\u2022 \n: how you can find your tribe, the people around whom you can be your best.\nFive Things You Can Do to Spread Body Kindness to the World\nThis is the final lesson the author shares in the book, so we decided to make it our final lesson as well:\n#1. Talk about more profound things than your or someone else\u2019s appearance. When you have the chance, try inspiring your friends and your family to make positive choices.\n#2. \u201cCare about yourself enough to not care that much.\u201d In other words\u2014to hell with other people\u2019s judgments. Love, connect and care.\n#3. Be brave. Share your \u201cbody kindness\u201d story with the ones you love.\n#4. Vote with your dollar, i.e., support the communities and business that make room for the majority of people in their definitions of health and beauty.\n#5.

And Why?\nIf you know what the New Thought and the Human Potential movements are about, then you probably know William Walker Atkinson, one of their earliest and foremost advocates.\nIf you don\u2019t know him, then you have an even bigger reason to read \n: this is one of the books from which \nand \n stem from.\nAbout William Walker Atkinson\n was an American merchant, attorney, publisher and writer, one of the pioneers of the New Thought movement.\nA prolific writer, he authored numerous books (possibly even more than a hundred), some other his own name, while others under his pseudonyms Theron Q. Dumont and Yogi Ramacharaka.\nStill respected for their style and influence, some of his books (such as \n) have remained in print continuously for more than a century.\n\u201cThought Vibration PDF Summary\u201d\nDubbed by William James \u201cthe religion of healthy-mindedness\u201d in his pioneering study \n,\nNew Thought was one of the very first spiritual movements developed on this side of the Atlantic, in the newly formed country of the United States.\nThe movement originated in the first decades of the 19\n century and is thought to have been derived from the unpublished works of Phineas Quimby, a mesmerist and inventor.\u00a0\nBy the beginning of the next century, when William Walker Atkinson became the editor of the popular \nmagazine (December 1901), the movement was already a nationwide phenomenon. However, Atkinson became such a prominent member and advocate that today he is widely regarded as one of the creators and pioneers of the movement.\nBy 1901, Atkinson hadn\u2019t published a single book, but during the next three decades (he died in 1932) he wrote and published at least one hundred.\nThough quite short (no longer than 100 pages in any edition), \nis one of the most remarkable ones he ever penned, both in terms of sheer power and creativity. In essence, it says nothing that previous books on the subject hadn\u2019t said (or modern \u201cLaw of Attraction\u201d books haven\u2019t copied), but it says it in so many beautiful and forceful sentences that it does look as if this must be the book where it all started.\nWe even feel kind of bad that we are unable to translate Atkinson\u2019s style into our summary\u2014after all, that may be this book\u2019s best trait.\nAs for its ideas\u2014let\u2019s cast a cold eye on the main ones, mostly shared in the first few chapters.\nWilliam Walker Atkinson\u2019s Working Creed\nWhen Atkinson became the editor of \n, he made himself known to the readers in a memorable article titled \u201cWorking Creed.\u201d Its power and status are such that this article is often included as a sort of an epigraph to \n(and many other books of Atkinson).\u00a0\nIt starts thus:\nAtkinson goes on in this manner for another page or two, stating his belief in the Brotherhood of Man and being kind, in the Socratic notion that Evil is ignorance and to the Hinduist idea that \u201cto the pure, all things are pure.\u201d\n\u201cI believe that there is an Infinite Power in, and of, all things,\u201d he concludes. \u201cI believe that, although today we have but the faintest idea of that power, still we will steadily grow to comprehend it more fully\u2014will get in closer touch with it. Even now we have momentary glimpses of its existence\u2014a momentary consciousness of Oneness with the Absolute.\u201d\n\u201cNone can read the recurring, ringing \u2018I believe\u2019 of this author,\u201d writes Franklin Barry in the 1906 \u201cPreface\u201d to \n,\n\u201cwithout feeling and sponsoring thrill of exaltation and power.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd, indeed, he seems about right.\nWhat Are Thought Vibrations?\nMost of what \nis about is stated in Atkinson\u2019s working creed. However, he does know his way around with words and is able to spin this belief across many pages, speckling it with some formidable claims that are, at best, insulated from science, and, at worst, decidedly disputable and pseudo-scientific.\nAtkinson is adamant that the Universe is governed by one great Law, only some of whose multiform manifestations are familiar to us. This Law is too inscrutable and ineffable to be pinned down into words, but we can get a glimpse of its inner workings through its most fascinating expressions among us.\u00a0\nThe Law of Gravitation is one of these, and the other, the one Atkinson wants to talk about, is the related Law of Attraction in the Thought World.\nAtkinson writes: \u201cWe are familiar with that wonderful manifestation of Law which draws and holds together the atoms of which matter is composed\u2014we recognize the power of the law that attracts bodies to the earth, that holds the circling worlds in their places\u2014but we close our eyes to the \n\u201d\nAs far as Atkinson is concerned, Thought is a force, a manifestation of Energy, a vibration sent through time and space\u2014and is as real and as intangible as the \u201cvibrations manifesting light, heat, electricity, magnetism.\u201d The only difference between these vibrations is the rate of vibration\u2014light and heat, for example, are manifested by vibrations of \u201ca far lower intensity of Thought.\u201d\u00a0\nBefore the invention of certain instruments, we couldn\u2019t perceive (see, hear, smell, feel, taste) most of these vibrations, and yet we were able to observe a magnet attracting another magnet. Nowadays, however, we have the experiments, and we can measure the vibrations that interest us, and, moreover, predict and utilize their behaviors.\nWell, it\u2019s pretty much the same with thought vibrations. The unfortunate difference here is that the human brain is still the only instrument capable of both producing and registering thought-waves.\nAtkinson does point out that he thinks humanity is on the brink of discovering \u201capparatus sufficiently delicate to catch and register\u201d thought vibrations, but a century has passed since he uttered this claim, and as far as we know, such an instrument has not been discovered yet.\nAs for manifestations, Atkinsons says, there are many, highlighting practical experiments in telepathy as definite evidence of the existence of thought vibration and the validity of the law of attraction.\nHow Does the Law of Attraction Work in the Thought World?\nConstantly and inevitably, our brain sends and receives thought vibrations. Moreover, unlike a magnet, it only receives the type of thoughts it sends.\nIn other words, if you send thought vibrations of love, you will attract the love thoughts of others; this will, in turn, stimulate you to start a journey along the path of love fulfillment, and you will start finding yourself in circumstances and surroundings in full accordance with your thought, and among people who love you back.\nOn the other hand, \u201cthoughts of Anger, Hate, Envy, Malice and Jealousy will draw to us the foul brood of kindred thoughts emanating from the minds of others; circumstances in which we will be called upon to manifest these vile thoughts and will receive them in turn from others; people who will manifest inharmony.\u201d\n\u201cLike attracts like in the Thought World,\u201d writes Atkinson, \u201cas ye sow so shall ye reap. Birds of a feather flock together in the Thought World\u2014curses like chickens come home to roost, and bringing their friends with them.\u201d\nIf you have problems understanding this, Atkinson advises you to start thinking of \u201cthe Marconi wireless instruments,\u201d which is to say \n. When \nwas published, this was something very new, but nowadays it is so old and outdated we don\u2019t even have to tell you how radio works.\nSimply put, a radio transmitter receives only those vibrations (from the thousands passing through the air) which are attuned to the same key.\u00a0\nWell, the same law applies to how our thoughts work: \u201cWe receive only that which corresponds to our mental attunement.\u201d Force yourself to change your attunement, and just like a radio transmitter, you should start receiving other types of vibrations.\nThis is why negative people see only negative things in the world and why positive people always see the glass half full.\nThe Secret of the Mind\n\u201cMan has but one mind,\u201d writes Atkinson, \u201cbut he has many mental faculties, each faculty being capable of functioning along two different lines of mental effort. There are no distinct dividing lines separating the two several functions of a faculty, but they shade into each other as do the colors of the spectrum.\u201d\nAn active effort of any of these faculties of the mind is the result of \u201ca direct impulse imparted at the time of the effort.\u201d In other words, an active effort is the thought vibrations you send, as governed by your will.\nA passive effort, on the other hand, is the result of one of these things:\n\u2022 a preceding active effort of the same mind;\n\u2022 an active effort of another mind (along the lines of suggestion);\n\u2022 a thought vibration from the mind of another; or\n\u2022 a thought impulse from an ancestor, transmitted by the laws of heredity.\nThe active effort is always fresh and new: it \n things; the passive effort, on the other hand, is the result of an active effort, and it does nothing but \n orders and suggestions. It is only the active function which is capable of sending forth vibrations; the passive only receives them.\nAnd this is the function you need to develop if you want to harness the power of your thoughts and not be the slave of someone else\u2019s.\u00a0\nThe Secret of the Will\n\u201cWhen you feel led to yield to the calling of your lower nature,\u201d Atkinson writes, \u201cfind a way to fix your mind on the Higher Self and draw inspiration from it.\u201d\nHere\u2019s a technique that may help you.\nWhen you feel vexed and cross and are tempted to burst into anger, assert the \u201cI,\u201d remember what you are and rise above your feeling.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen you feel fearful, remember that the Real Self fears nothing and assert courage; in much the same manner, when you feel jealousy inciting, think of your higher nature and cast it aside by laughing.\nAll of these feelings are unworthy of you and must be taught to keep their places. Atkinson writes:\nNo matter what they teach you, your mind is amenable to your Will, which is \u201cthe outward manifestation of the \n and is capable of attracting the Absolute.\nIt is here that the real power of man comes from: the awareness that the \u201cI\u201d is the sovereign of the mind and that everything bad is the result of mental misgovernment. Harness the power of your Will, and you will harness the power of your potential.\nHere\u2019s a great exercise described by Atkinson: just perform at least \ndisagreeable task each day during a single month.\u00a0\n\u201cAnyone can do a pleasant thing cheerfully,\u201d writes Atkinson, \u201cbut it takes Will to do the unpleasant thing cheerfully; and that is how you must do the work.

There is this difference, however: the waves on the water move only on a level plane in all directions, whereas thought waves move in all directions from a common center, just as do the rays from the sun.\u201d\nThe Active Part of the Mind Produces, and the Passive Mind Receives Thought Vibrations\nThough we have only one mind, it can function at two different levels of mental endeavor: active and passive.\nThe active part of the mind is the one which produces these thought vibrations, the one powerful enough to throw a stone in the water.\nThe passive part of the mind, on the other hand, constantly receives other thought vibrations, some of them coming from the active part of the same mind, while others of other people or even ancestors.\nLike Attracts Like in the World of Thought\nIt is important to know that the passive part of the mind works pretty much like a radio receiver: it doesn\u2019t receive all the thought vibrations that are present in the air, but only the one attuned to its frequency.\nYup, you read that right: you can attune your mind to receive only certain kinds of thought vibrations.\nAnd the best way to attune it is by producing thought vibration of the wished-for frequency.\u00a0\nPut plainly, if you emit love, you\u2019ll receive love; if you emit hate, hate is what you will get in return.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThought Vibration Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nIf you don\u2019t think that \nis outdated, you should just spend a second of your time thinking about that Marconi radio reference or Atkinson\u2019s belief that we are at the brink of discovering a thought-registering instrument.\nHowever, unlike many other books which deal with the Law of Attraction, \ndoesn\u2019t sound that maudlin or na\u00efve, courtesy of Atkinson\u2019s powerful style.\nFor better or for worse, mainly because of it, his ideas reverberate in many of the books written today, even though scientists have repeatedly questioned them.We are not scientists, so we\u2019ll let you be the judge: \nis a short book, and it will take you not more than two hours of your life.

Yeah \u2013 we know: we can (and \n) do better at it as well.\nFortunately, Buddhist monk Gelong Thubten is here to help:\n.\nWho Should Read \u201cA Monk\u2019s Guide to Happiness\u201d? And Why?\n\u201cThe aim of this book,\u201d writes Gelong Thubten at the end of the first chapter of \n, \u201cis to help you create happiness through bringing meditation into the heart of your daily life\u2014not only to reduce stress and gain greater mastery over your thoughts and emotions but also to discover your mind\u2019s deep potential for unconditional compassion and freedom.\u201d\nIf that sounds like something you\u2019d want to do, then \n is definitely a book for you. Because we honestly feel that it achieves what it attempts.\nAbout Gelong Thubten\n is a Buddhist monk from the UK.\nHe became one after a life-threatening heart problem and severe burnout cut short his promising acting career at 21, on which he had embarked after being educated at Oxford.\nA world pioneer in mindfulness meditation training, Gelong Thubten has lectured at his alma mater and for the UN, in addition to teaching at major companies such as Google and LinkedIn.\nAfter collaborating with Yale neuroscientist Ash Ranpura and Ruby Wax on \n, Thubten wrote \n, his debut solo book.\nFind out more at \n.\n\u201cA Monk\u2019s Guide to Happiness PDF Summary\u201d\nIf there is one thing Gelong Thubten, a Buddhist monk from the UK, can\u2019t understand, it is the extent to which the concept of happiness is misunderstood and misinterpreted by the majority of people.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve found that many people seek a kind of happiness which is a fleeting sensation: a \u2018high\u2019\u2014an injection-like bolt of energy,\u201d he writes. \u201cYet this never seems to last, and when they no longer experience that high, they crave it again.\u201d\nUnfortunately, Thubten is right.\nMost of us don\u2019t think of happiness as a \nwe can learn, but as a \nwe should obtain. We don\u2019t think of happiness as something asking for our expertise and personal commitment (i.e., something similar to, say, math or sculpting), but as something which is the direct result of external circumstances, something that can only come from the outside.\nYet, this is evidently not true.\u00a0\n\u201cIf it\u2019s the case that two or more people don\u2019t always find that the same things make them happy or unhappy,\u201d reminds us Thubten, \u201cthen it means we\u2019re talking about a mental experience within us, not the things around us.\u201d\nis a book about turning within, a manual on how one can find the source of happiness inside himself.\u00a0\nIt is a book based on the premise that we can\nto be happy, \n.\nAnd it is yet another book we\u2019ll gladly summarize for you!\nWhat Is Happiness?\n (and almost all philosophers after him), happiness is the only thing we desire for its own sake. It is the end-goal of all our endeavors. Whether you want more money or more love in your life, the real reason why you want these things is that you believe they will bring you happiness.\nConsequently, it is not at all surprising that all of us are constantly searching for happiness. But what if we\u2019re looking for it at all the wrong places?\nGelong Thubten thinks this the case for a very simple reason: most of us don\u2019t even know what happiness is. That is why we confuse it with being a \u201chit,\u201d a \u201cbuzz,\u201d a sudden bolt of energy.\u00a0\nIn Thubten\u2019s opinion (and, more importantly, experience), happiness is much less temporary and much less linked to external circumstances. It is something we have inside, and something into whose power we can easily tap in if we understood its nature.\nSo, perhaps, that is a great place to start\u2014with a clear and profoundly thought-out answer to the question: \u201cwhat is happiness?\u201d\nThubten defines it along the lines of a few \u201ccrucial terms\u201d\u2014presence, completeness, and freedom:\nWhat Makes Us Unhappy?\nAn even better way to understand happiness is to define it against its opposite: being unhappy. And Thubten has a very original and interesting take on what unhappiness is.\u00a0\nIt is, according to him, nothing less than the state of \n for happiness.\nBecause when we are \n for happiness, \u201cthere is a sense of hunger, of incompleteness; we are wrapped up in the expectation of getting what we want and the fear of not getting it; we feel trapped by uncertainty.\u201d\nAnd this state of uncertainty is overwhelming: it causes stress and discontent since we feel that our life at the present moment is not enough and that we can only be happy when our goals are completed.\nBut does that ever happen?\nSay that you want to buy a pair of expensive glasses and say that you can\u2019t afford them. Every time you think about them, you feel unhappy\u2014you\u2019re absolutely sure that once you buy those glasses, you\u2019ll finally be happy.\nNow, say that, eventually, you manage to find enough money to buy those glasses. How long before you start craving for something else? A week, a month, a few months? Perhaps even a few days. And then you\u2019re back at the beginning.\nAnd there\u2019s no way you can trick this loop because of something scientists call \n. Also, because of something Gelong Thubten warns about at the beginning of his book: you\u2019re thinking of happiness along the wrong lines.\nThe state of happiness isn\u2019t something ephemeral\u2014isn\u2019t a hit of dopamine in the brain. The state of happiness, he says, is an enduring state of completeness, a state of peace, a state of no more striving and no more fear.\u00a0\nThe good thing is that these are all mental states, and that, consequently, all of them depend on you and you exclusively. No outside \u201cthings,\u201d no circumstances you can\u2019t control.\u00a0\nIs it that easy?\nWe Are Hard-Wired to Be Happy\nYes, it is, says Thubten!\nAccording to Buddhist philosophy, he reminds us, we are practically programmed to be happy: \u201cThe very reason we \n be happy is that it is our true nature. This is why we feel things are in their rightful state when we\u2019re happy: suffering feels like an intrusion into how things should be.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s not only the Buddhist who think this: science recently confirmed it as a fact.\n\u201cWe are hard-wired for bliss,\u201d famously exclaimed late neuroscientist Candace Pert sometime after discovering the opioid receptors, a group of protein-coupled receptors distributed widely in our brains, digestive tract, and spinal cord.\nTheir job (in case their name isn\u2019t a giveaway) is to work as a sort of \u201ccellular binding site for endorphins,\u201d which, in turn, are hormones produced by the pituitary gland and the central nervous system whose principal task is to \u201cinhibit the communication of pain signals.\u201d\nYup, you read that right!\nWe may not be as blessed as the naked mole rats (which are practically immune to pain), but our body is designed in such a manner that it can\u2019t help but producing its own morphine-like substances whenever it deems necessary to shelter us from pain.\nBut the very existence of this mechanism which protects us from negative influences is evidence enough that our body is programmed to know what is right and what is wrong in the first place. Interestingly enough, therein lies the problem.\nAsh Ranpura, neuroscientist and frequent collaborator of Gelong Thubten, describes the problem thus: \u201cwhen things are going well, the brain simply ticks over its default state, but if we are about to trip and fall, for example, it generates \u2018error signal\u2019 which kicks into gear.\u201d\nIn other words, when everything\u2019s fine, you feel \n. When something is wrong\u2014you feel bad. And you can\u2019t help it: your brain will always adjust to the perfect state of things and notice only the bad things.\n\u201cSimply put,\u201d writes Thubten, \u201cwhen we are walking in a park on a glorious sunny day, and we have a toothache, we take the sunshine and beauty for granted, but tend to focus on the painful tooth. We are primed to notice what\u2019s wrong, as it feels like an intrusion into our natural state.\u201d\nMeditation is the Key to Happiness\nIf there is one thing people deem inescapable, it is certainly our biology.\u00a0\nSo, if we are biologically built to predominantly notice the things which blemish our perfect state (be their things or wants, regrets or misfortunes), how are we supposed to achieve those mental states (presence, completeness, freedom) which happiness consists of?\nWell, we\u2019re not going to tell you anything new: meditation is the key to achieving happiness.\nMost people think of it as something which temporarily reduces stress. This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth: meditation, combined with mindfulness, is a way of living your life, a way of hacking your genetic predetermination to notice the bad things, a way of connecting with your essence.\nIn fact, one of the Tibetan words for meditation is \n, which literally means \u201cto become familiar with.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd what are we becoming familiar with through meditation?\u00a0\nWell, it\u2019s nothing new: it\u2019s merely our already existing awareness that there is a part of our brain which is constantly free.\nYou may think this is something you\u2019re not aware of, but, trust us\u2014you are. Whether you want it or not, you can constantly observe your thoughts and emotions. You are not only \n anger or sadness, but you also \n that you are angry or sad.\nIt is this latter part of the brain that meditation targets and attempts to develop: the observing part:\nMuch of Gelong Tubten\u2019s book includes practical suggestions on how you can implement meditation and mindfulness in your life. Since this is something we\u2019ve already covered in so many other summaries, we decided to focus on the theory behind this.\nAnd we feel that the above pretty much wraps up all the theory you need. Now, it\u2019s time you start practicing meditation and, well, being happy.\nKey Lessons from \u201cA Monk\u2019s Guide to Happiness\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Feeling Good in the \u201cInstant Happiness\u201d Culture\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Happiness Is Much More Than a Hit: It Is Freedom\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You Are Hard-Wired to Be Happy: Use This to Be Happy As Often As Possible\nFeeling Good in the \u201cInstant Happiness\u201d Culture\nEverybody wants to feel good, so it\u2019s no surprise that, nowadays, everyone attempts to sell this feeling.\nWhether it is through a new drink, a new shirt, or a new car\u2014what all those ads you see while scrolling through Facebook or browsing through your favorite magazines are selling to you is nothing more but some mythical feeling of happiness.\nOr so they say.\nWhat they are actually selling to you is a lie\u2014a lie that you are not good enough, that you, in your current state, \nsomething. And, even scarier, that happiness is something which comes from the \u201coutside.\u201d\nHappiness Is Much More Than a Hit: It Is Freedom\nAs Buddhists have known for a couple of millennia, happiness is not just a dopamine rush in your brain: it is an enduring state of completeness and peace of mind.\nMuch more, it is freedom\u2014freedom from the fear of missing out, freedom from the burden of the past and the future, freedom from your wants and desires.\nYou Are Hard-Wired to Be Happy: Use This to Be Happy As Often As Possible\nNo matter how good you feel, you\u2019ll never be happy if you think of happiness in terms of external things and circumstances.\u00a0\nThe reason is called hedonic adaptation, which, in layman\u2019s terms, means that your brain takes the good things that happen to you for granted, and the bad states as aberrations. In other words, it only \n when something is bad.\nHowever, \n, you need to check all of the items on your list (partner, family, children, friends, career\u2026) to be fully happy and content; even if one remains unchecked (say, you have toothache), you\u2019ll feel unhappy.\nIt would be a certain recipe for disaster this genetic precondition of ours if you didn\u2019t have the chance to learn to use it to your benefit.\u00a0\nAnd you can quite easily: just be mindful of it and meditate, and everything will work out fine in the end.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cA Monk\u2019s Guide to Happiness Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nA worthy addition to our \n, \n and \n, \n is, in the words of Professor Lokesh Joshi, \u201ca wonderful book\u2026 compelling to read, yet full of profound wisdom.\u201d\n\u201cGelong Thubten\u2019s book is as warm, wise and generous as the man himself,\u201d adds Melanie Reid for \n\u201cWe\u2019ve never needed a voice like his more.\u201d\nAnd, indeed, in the age of \u201cinstant\u201d happiness, books which advocate lasting and genuine peace of mind are something of a much necessary balancing antidote. We should not only be thankful for their existence\u2014we should attempt to implement them in ours as well.\nAnd one can\u2019t do much wrong if he starts this journey toward personal happiness with Gelong Thubten\u2019s \n."},

And Why?\nIf you are interested in history\u2014especially in pharaohs and Ancient Egypt\u2014then you should definitely have a look at \n \nBut read it if you want to understand why women don\u2019t rule the world at present, and why they should in the future: besides being a historical study, Kara Cooney\u2019s \n reads like a feminist manifesto as well, one mostly based on empirical data taken from the mother of all knowledge\u2014history.\nAbout Kara Cooney\n is an American Egyptologist, archaeologist, and associate professor of Egyptian Art and Architecture at UCLA.\nA specialist in coffin studies, craft production, and economies in the ancient world, Cooney is the author of two books.

Maybe that\u2019s why Kara Cooney begins her book on the most famous Egypt\u2019s queens with a very telling fairytale stock phrase:\nNow, make no mistakes: if it sounds too good to be true, that is because it is. Even Egypt, \u201cthe only state that consistently allowed female rule,\u201d was, in the long run, \u201cno less cruel and oppressive to women than every other complex society on Earth.\u201d\u00a0\nIt too had merely a few female rulers, and \u201csuffered a woman leader only when it had to, expunging her from the eyes of her people as soon as possible.\u201d\nWhat does that mean?\nIt means that a woman could become a king only if the male king was too old or too young to rule\u2014or, perhaps, hadn\u2019t been born yet. It also means that no matter what these queens did, the pharaohs that came after them, consistently \u201cerased or omitted their names from the formal \u2018king lists\u2019 of monarchs created by the royal temple.\u201d\nSo, in short: the power was freely given to them because Egypt needed them. When it didn\u2019t need them anymore, it acted as if these women never ruled.\nIn \n \n, Kara Cooney tries to change this, so that we can better understand \u201cthis strange and contradictory tale of unadulterated female power wielded by poorly remembered women over an extraordinary 3,000-year run of ups and downs.\u201d\nSo, let\u2019s turn to the women themselves.\nMerneith: Queen of Blood\nMerneith was not only one of the first female rulers of Egypt\u2014she was one of the first rulers of Egypt, period.\nShe ruled during Dynasty 1 (3000\u20132890 B.C.), at the very dawn of the Egyptian nation-state, when (as Cooney says) \u201ckingship was new and brutal.\u201d\u00a0\nWhen her father, the revered King Djer died, her brother Djet inherited the throne from him. Soon after, he asked Merneith to be his wife and, expectedly, she agreed. No need to reread the previous sentence: Merneith was now, indeed, both the sister and the chosen wife of the new pharaoh.\nKing Djet unexpectedly died only a few years in his reign, and his son with Merneith, Den, was too young to rule\u2014so Merneith became the ruler instead.\u00a0\nHer first duty?\nTo properly prepare the burial for her husband and brother.\nShe did her best: per the ceremonial practices (which asked for sacrifices), she killed hundreds of people, most of them half-brothers of Den. The reason is apparent: she wanted to make sure that when Den becomes a Pharaoh, not one of his power-hungry relatives would be able to challenge his rule.\nThough she never officially became the sovereign, Merneith ruled for Den for six or seven years and, when she died, she was honored with a king\u2019s burial: 120 close relatives of her lie buried next to her in the royal necropolis of Abydos.\nNeferusobek: The Last Woman Standing\nEleven dynasties after Merneith, Neferusobek (or Sobekneferu) of Dynasty 12 (1985\u20131773 B.C.) became the first female Pharaoh of which we have undeniable proof.\nShe was the daughter of Amenemhat III, a powerful ruler whose reign is deemed the golden age of the Middle Egyptian Kingdom. Additionally, just like Merneith, Neferusobek was also the wife of her brother, in her case, Amenemhat IV.\nUnfortunately, due to this tradition of incestuous relationships, Amenemhat IV was sterile, so he didn\u2019t leave a male heir after his death. That\u2019s how Neferusobek, the last ruler of the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt, assumed the throne.\nShe remained there for no more than four years, a period during which she completed the construction of a temple complex in Hawara and added places of worship in structures at Heracleopolis Magna.\u00a0\nShe died a mysterious death but was not forgotten: she was preserved in most of the king lists, honored for protecting the land in a time of distress.\nHatshepsut: Queen of Public Relations\nThe second historically-confirmed female pharaoh came to power four centuries after Neferusobek.\u00a0\nHer name was Hatshepsut (of Dynasty 18, 1550\u20131295 B.C.) and she was \u201cthe only woman to have ever taken power as king in ancient Egypt during a time of prosperity and expansion.\u201d\nThat was not the only rule Hatshepsut broke.\nAppointed to the office of High Priestess by her father Thutmose I as a young girl, Hatshepsut became the wife of her brother, Thutmose II, soon after he inherited the throne. Thutmose II accomplished absolutely nothing during his short reign and was supposed to be succeeded by a son born of his harem.\nAt the time of Thutmose II\u2019s death, the boy, Thutmose III, was just a toddler, so his mother was supposed to act as pharaoh regnant. However, she (her name was Iset) was incapacitated, so Hatshepsut was assigned to the role. And she remained there a long, long time\u201422 years to be exact.\nShe seems to have been a very smart queen, doling out riches and titles to the men around her to appease them. She also built majestic religious buildings, such as the Temple of Millions of Years at Thebes, and a powerful Red Sea fleet which, in turn, made famous trading expeditions around Africa.\u00a0\nShe went personally on the most well-known among these, the one to the Land of Punt, a semimythical place dubbed \u201cthe Land of God\u201d by Ancient Egyptians. When she returned from this daring expedition with priceless aromas and spices, Hatshepsut was rewarded with the respect of her people.\nLike her father, Hatshepsut also organized military expeditions and expanded Egypt\u2019s borders to Nubia and Kush. She also raised a great king: the empire of Thutmose III would become the largest Egypt would ever see.\nUnfortunately, Thutmose III was a bit ungrateful and destroyed every memory of his stepmother once he became the pharaoh. In Cooney\u2019s words,\u00a0\nNefertiti: More Than Just a Pretty Face\nA century after Hatshepsut, Nefertiti, also of Dynasty 18, became the wife of Amenhotep IV, perhaps the instigator of the first monotheistic religious revolution in history.\nIn the fifth year of his reign, Amenhotep ordered a sed festival, even though this was a privilege only for the pharaohs who retained the throne for three decades. It was even stranger when he dedicated it to the sun god Aten, a minor god in Egypt\u2019s polytheistic pantheon.\nLittle did the Egyptian elites knew that this was merely the beginning: soon after, Amenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaten (\u201cThe One Who Is Beneficial to the Aten\u201d), and, before too long, he started destroying old temples and building new ones (all of them dedicated to the sun god), going so far to even order the erection of a new capital, Amarna.\nAkhenaten seemed to have loved Nefertiti a lot\u2014who wouldn\u2019t have\u2014which is why \u201cThe Great King\u2019s Wife\u201d had all the freedom she wanted. It is quite possible that she used it to reinvent herself, in the twelfth year of her husband\u2019s rule, as Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten, his co-king.\nShe ruled with him during the next five years and, after his death, she may have reinvented herself yet again as Ankhkheperure Smenkhkare, the pharaoh who came next in line and who ruled before the boy-king Tutankhamun.\nEgyptologists are not sure whether Ankhkheperure Smenkhkare was Nefertiti, but many think so. If that is the case, she successfully guided Egypt on a path to recovery after a period of great turmoil.\n\u201cNefertiti is remembered to us as a great beauty, a chiseled face of loveliness and sensual desire,\u201d writes Kara Cooney. \u201cBut she may have been much more if recent investigations are correct.\u201d\nTawosret: The Survivor\nDuring Dynasty 19 (1295\u20131186 B.C.), another woman named Tawosret became pharaoh. But she did so in a way none of her female predecessors did: \u201cthrough her husband, an unrelated royal heir, and brutal civil unrest.\u201d\nTawosret was the wife of Seti II, who was supposed to be the pharaoh of Egypt when he sat on the throne around 1200. However, at the same time, another man named Amunmesses (or Amenmesse), possibly his half-brother, seized control over Nubia and Thebes and announced his claim to the throne.\u00a0\nSeti II emerged victorious from the power battle which followed but unexpectedly died after trying to consolidate power in Thebes via Chancellor Bay. Bay installed a new king, a 14-year-old boy named Siptah, a guy too young and sickly (he had cerebral palsy) to rule at the time. So, he was placed under the guidance of Tawosret, the queen regent (and possibly his stepmother).\nAnd this is where things got messy: Bay expected for Siptah to die soon (and, true, he died at 16) and to assume power himself. Tawosret had a plan of her own: she killed Bay and became the first female pharaoh to rule unaccompanied by father or husband or son.\nShe was killed by a warlord named Setnakht only two years after she became the sovereign. Just like Neferusobek, Tawosret was also the last ruler of her Dynasty.\n\u201cHer tomb in the Valley of the Kings,\u201d informs us Cooney, \u201cshows her as a female king, but that sepulcher would be taken over by the very same man who had her violently removed from power.\u201d\nCleopatra: Drama Queen\nDuring the millennium or so after Taworset, female power lay dormant in Egypt as parts of the country were repeatedly conquered by foreign powers. Unsurprisingly, Egypt\u2019s last queen\u2014and the most famous of the lot\u2014was actually a foreigner: Cleopatra VII, member of a Macedonian Greek ruling family (the Ptolemaic Dynasty which came after \n and lasted from 305 B.C. to 30 B.C.).\u00a0\nWhen she was 14 years old, Cleopatra was named co-ruler of Egypt by Ptolemy XII, her father, who named his son Ptolemy XIII as his successor. However, Cleopatra\u2019s brother wanted to rule Egypt all by himself, so he exiled Cleopatra to Syria.\nUnfortunately for him, he allied himself with the wrong person, the Roman general Pompey who lost the Civil War in Rome to Julius Caesar. Cleopatra used the situation to charm Caesar and ask from him to force her brother to reinstate her as a co-ruler.\u00a0\nPtolemy XIII refused, much to his misfortune, because that caused his demise: united, Cleopatra and Caesar won the war against Ptolemy, and Cleopatra became co-ruler with her younger brother, Ptolemy XIV.\nAs it is well known, Caesar\u2019s weakness for Cleopatra resulted in Cleopatra\u2019s first child, Caesarion, but also in her lover\u2019s assassination. Cleopatra acted quickly: she poisoned her brother and positioned Caesarion as co-ruler in his place.\nMoreover, she also started yet another affair, with one of Caesar\u2019s former allies, Mark Anthony. She bore him children as well, and for a while, the institution of a Roman-Egyptian dynasty looked all but inevitable.\nHowever, the feeling wasn\u2019t shared by the powerful Roman elites, who, under the command of Octavian August, started a war against Marc Anthony and Cleopatra.\nThe final result?\nWhen it was evident that the war\u2014and, as Byron would say, \u201cthe ancient world\u201d\u2014was irretrievably lost, Anthony stabbed himself, Cleopatra poisoned herself in a bathtub, and Caesarion was killed by the Romans, taking her younger children hostage.\nThat marked not only the end of Cleopatra but, in a way, of Egypt\u2019s glory as well.\nKey Lessons from \u201cWhen Women Ruled the World\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Divine Kingship: Egypt\u2019s Political System \n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Stories of Egypt\u2019s Female Pharaohs\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Why Women Don\u2019t\u2014And Should\u2014Rule the World\nDivine Kingship: Egypt\u2019s Political System\u00a0\nIn Egyptian mythology, the primeval king of Egypt, the god Osiris, passes his title on his son, Horus. Nothing strange\u2014that\u2019s how it is in almost all human cultures. A father-king transfers his power to his son whose duty is to produce a male offspring so that the country can be indefinitely ruled by powerful men.\nHowever, Egypt was an exception to this rule, possibly because they worshipped almost as much as Osiris his wife and sister, Isis, \u201cthe alpha and omega of Egyptian kingship.\u201d Queen and lover, nurturer and mother, Isis was the reason why, from time to time, women got to become pharaohs as well.\nAnd we\u2019re not stretching the truth here at all: since all of Egypt\u2019s rulers, according to its unique system of power called divine kingship, were representatives of gods on earth, women-pharaohs \n to be adored by everybody as much as men-pharaohs. After all, they were practically goddesses.\nThe Stories of Egypt\u2019s Female Pharaohs\nHowever, it is essential to note that, even though Ancient Egypt is the only country which consistently allowed for women to become as powerful as men, it was still ostensibly a patriarchal and authoritarian society.\u00a0\nMore or less, women could only become pharaohs when the designated king was either too young or too old to rule\u2014or when he was not even born.\nBe that as it may, the six women whose stories are told by Kara Cooney in \nMerneith, Neferusobek, Hatshepsut, Nefertiti, Tawosret, and Cleopatra\u2014did manage to become the most powerful person in Egypt (all in their own times), and five of them served as king outright.\nWhy do we know so little of them today?\nBecause the men who came to rule Egypt after them erased their names from the formal \u2018king lists\u2019 of monarchs created by the royal temple.\nYou\u2019d think that something like that doesn\u2019t happen today\u2014but it does. Think of Janet Reno or Janet Yellen. Just recently two of the most powerful people in the United States, both of them are practically forgotten by today.\u00a0\nWhy Women Don\u2019t\u2014And Should\u2014Rule the World\n\u201cThe Egyptians,\u201d writes Cooney, \u201cwere light-years ahead of us in their trust of female power\u2026 We may be a 50/50 society in terms of gender, yet women do not hold 50 percent of the power.\u201d\n\u201cWhether we want to admit it or not,\u201d she goes on, \u201cvoting a woman into office makes most Americans feel uncomfortable, even threatened, because she appears more strident and shrill and bossy than her male counterpart, according to countless sociological studies.\u201d\nIn other words, women don\u2019t rule the world because we distrust them much more than their male counterparts. \n uncovers that this was not always the case. On the contrary, in fact: Ancient Egypt fostered female ambition, and, that way, it was able to raise queens it was (at least for a short time) proud of.\nWith this in mind, Cooney is able to conclude:\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cWhen Women Ruled the World Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\n is the perfect combination of historical research and down-to-earth language.\nInformative and enjoyable in a novel-like fashion, it is an excellent book to start exploring the world of Egyptian female pharaohs\u2014if not the world of Egypt\u2019s divine kingship system itself."},

Stark and Jane Flaherty are here to help:\nWho Should Read \u201cThe Only Negotiating Guide You\u2019ll Ever Need\u201d? And Why?\nIt was Daniel Pink who taught us that \n. Negotiating, of course, is an essential part of the process\u2014and is something that happens much more often than you think, both at your home and at work.\u00a0\nUnlike \nor the similarly titled but more specific \nby Roger Dawson, \n is much more universal in its scope, much better structured for the beginner, and much more straightforward in its advices.\nConsequently, it is for everyone who needs a primer on negotiating, regardless of whether he/she needs it for negotiating a round of golf from his wife or a better price at a garage sale.\nAbout Peter B. Stark and Jane Flaherty\n is a bestselling author, consultant, speaker, and president of Peter Barron Stark Companies.\u00a0\nOne of the most sought-after professional speakers in areas such as negotiation and leadership, Stark holds the prestigious designation of Accredited Speaker from Toastmasters International as well as CSP from the National Speakers Association.\nHe has co-written several books, including \n, \n, \n, and \n is a senior consultant and trainer for Peter Barron Stark Companies.\u00a0\nWith over twenty-five years of experience designing and delivering training programs around the world, she is a respected leadership and negotiating trainer.\nShe is a frequent writing collaborator of Peter B. Stark, having co-written with him all of the books mentioned above and few more.\n\u201cThe Only Negotiating Guide You\u2019ll Ever Need PDF Summary\u201d\nIn a research study of university studies conducted about a decade ago, more than a third of the participants answered that they seldom or never negotiate.\nThe truth is, however, quite the opposite:\nThat\u2019s why you need a negotiating guide. And \n\u2014not just because of the title\u2014is one of the best ones you\u2019ll find on the market.\nIt is conveniently divided into two parts: \u201cThe Skillful Negotiator\u201d and \u201c101 Tactics for Successful Negotiation.\u201d As the titles themselves suggest, the first part is mainly theoretical and explains the basics of negotiation, while the second one is practical and goes over what this means in practice.\nPart I: The Skillful Negotiator\nAs we pointed out above, \u201cmost of us are involved in negotiations to one degree or another for a good part of any given day.\u201d\nConsequently\u2014and contrary to popular opinion\u2014negotiation tactics should never be considered anything less than \u201ca positive way of structuring the communication process.\u201d\nIn other words, as Gerard I. Nierenberg\u2014justly dubbed \u201cThe Father of Negotiation Training\u201d by \n\u2014said a few decades ago: \u201cin a successful negotiation, everybody wins.\u201d\nAnd that feels like a good place to start our summary!\n, any negotiation you take part of can end in only one of four (\n five) possible outcomes: lose-lose, win-lose, win-win, or no outcome (no consequences, negative or positive).\nNeedless to say, lose-lose\nis the least desirable outcome.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, it is also one which often happens.\u00a0\nStark and Flaherty point to the June 2016 grocery workers strike against the supermarket chains Ralphs and Albertsons, which ended with them accepting 35% cut to their pensions, and Ralphs and Albertsons losing $1.5 billion in sales and about 30% of the market.\nWin-lose or lose-win\nis the outcome everybody secretly hopes for\u2014that is, if you end up on the winning side.\u00a0\nOf course, if you are capable of doing that, you might not be interested in any other outcome. However, even so, in the long run, win-lose doesn\u2019t work as well as you think. And that\u2019s because when you create a win-lose situation, the loser will most likely refuse to negotiate with you again in the future.\n\u201cAlmost all win-lose relationships end up lose-lose over time,\u201d say Stark and Flaherty.\nThe ideal outcome is, of course, win-win, i.e., the outcome when the needs of both parties are met.\nYou might think this sounds like something taken out of a fairytale, but it is not: win-win is quite a possible outcome and is best in both the short and the long run.\nAs an example of this kind of outcome, Stark and Flaherty point to Barack Obama successfully normalizing relations between the US and Cuba after half a century.\nEverybody won in the end.\n\u201cAfter years and years of failed negotiations,\u201d Stark and Flaherty write, \u201cboth countries were granted release of their prisoners. Americans and Cuban Americans are free to travel to Cuba. The Cubans will significantly benefit from the travel and trade revenue that is brought to their country from the United States.\u201d\nThis is the final possible outcome: the lack of one. Neither party wins or loses\u2014everything remains just the way it was at the beginning.\nA great example of negotiating \u201cno-outcome\u201d is you selling your car. Your buyer doesn\u2019t agree with your estimation, you don\u2019t agree with his/her offer. As a result, he walks out, and you try to find another buyer.\nOf course, every \u201cno outcome\u201d can evolve into a \u201cwin-win\u201d or \u201close-lose\u201d outcome. For example, if you find a buyer willing to give you more money, you\u2019ll see the \u201cno outcome\u201d as a preparation for a \u201cwin-win\u201d scenario.\u00a0\nHowever, if, after several buyers unwilling to commit, you realize that the offer of the first one was the best one, you\u2019re heading toward a \u201close-lose\u201d outcome as a direct consequence of the previous \u201cno outcome.\u201d\n\u201cSome negotiators,\u201d write Stark and Flaherty, \u201chave a strong reputation for consistently achieving win-win outcomes in their negotiations.\u201d\nIf you want to become one of them, then it\u2019s best to keep the following three guidelines in mind:\nWhether you\u2019re negotiating with your spouse or a\nseller, focusing on just one issue is one of the worst things you can do during a negotiation. It almost inevitably sets the scene for a win-lose outcome.\nNo matter what the negotiation subject, there are always more \nto be considered. And the more issues are on the table, the more chances there are for both sides to juggle them into a \u201cwin-win\u201d outcome.\nFor example, if you\u2019re buying something and negotiating only the price, there\u2019s a good chance one side will lose the bargain. However, if you bring up additional deal points to negotiate (delivery date, financing, upgrades, warranty, training, and support), you might get yourself a deal.\nThe interesting part: all of the things put in the parenthesis above contribute to the overall \u201cprice\u201d of the product; and yet, people narrow themselves down to one issue in most negotiations.\nEverything other than this attitude inevitably leads to a win-lose situation.\u00a0\nDon\u2019t ever start a negotiation with the idea that your gain is your counterpart\u2019s loss and vice versa. First of all, the market is never that rational or simple, and, secondly, it is not a good feeling to end up on the losing side.\nIt is not only important to \n assume that your counterpart has the same needs as you, but it is also important to assume that you don\u2019t know his/her needs.\nIt\u2019s quite common for negotiators to make this mistake, simply because sometimes\n.\nFor example, a seller might assume that his/her buyer wants to buy the product or service in question at the lowest price possible, but what if his/her actual need is, in this case, quality or status?\nThat\u2019s a missed opportunity for a \u201cwin-win\u201d outcome, right there!\n\u201cThe three most critical elements in negotiation,\u201d inform us Stark and Flaherty, \u201care time (the period over which the negotiation takes place), information (the more you have, the better), and power (which comes in many forms).\u201d\nMost negotiations, just like almost everything in life, are a process.\u00a0\nAnd, once again, just like most things in life, they seem to adhere to the Pareto principle, with over 80 percent of your results in a negotiation generally agreed upon in the last 20 percent of the time.\nIf you want to bring time to your side of the table during a negotiation, it is smart to follow these simple guidelines:\nAbout half a millennium ago, Francis Bacon noted that \u201cknowledge is power,\u201d and there is nothing truer than this as far as negotiations are concerned.\nThe more you know about the topic being negotiated, the better the result. The less you know, the more susceptible you are to being on the losing side of a \u201cwin-lose\u201d outcome.\nA negotiation is not an event, but a process, which starts long before the actual face-to-face encounter. Be prepared.\nFind out everything you need from anyone who has the facts and statistics, be him/her a friend of yours or a relative, a colleague or an acquaintance of your counterpart. Browse the Internet, check the archives, and never forget\u2014your counterpart will probably do the same.\n\u201cSeveral types of power can influence the outcome of a negotiation,\u201d point Stark and Flaherty, highlighting the word \n in that sentence, \u201cbecause if you have power but don\u2019t use it, the power adds no value to the negotiation.\u201d\nAccording to them, there are ten types of power that need to be taken into consideration and that, unfortunately, can not only be used but also abused:\nIn addition to these types of power, they point out the five rules of power as well:\nAccording to Stark and Flaherty, no matter what the subject of negotiation, there are three types of negotiators you are bound to come across: sharks, carps, and dolphins.\u00a0\nAs far as the sharks are concerned, there are no other outcomes but the win-lose outcome; and they are unwilling to end up on the losing side.\nThey live in a world of scarcity and think that it is important to win at all costs. That\u2019s why, for them, it is vital to focus on the \u201ckill.\u201d\nCarps too live in a world of scarcity, but their final objective is not to win but to minimize their losses.\nThey dread confrontation and are entering all negotiations with the idea that they will have to work hard to just maintain what they already have.\u00a0\nNeedless to say, when faced with a shark, the carps always end up being on the losing side.\nThe dolphins are the best negotiators because they live in a world of potential abundance: as far as they are concerned, negotiations can have numerous different outcomes, and not only two.\nThey are flexible and can change their behavior depending on the situation. In addition, they would try everything to swim around a confrontation, but if challenged by a shark, they are capable of responding swiftly and purposefully.\nThey are also quick to forgive, as well. So, if a counterpart, even if shark, shows any signs of cooperation, dolphins are capable of quickly switching from retaliation to a more cooperative strategy.\nPart II: 101 Tactics for Successful Negotiation\nAs we said above, part 2 of \nincludes no less than 101 tactics for a successful negotiation. And we mean literally \u201cno less,\u201d because, in the revised edition, there are also 20 bonus tactics included!\nThe tactics are presented in a uniform manner: each of the presentations includes a description of the tactic, an example, and a counter.\nOf course, even listing the 101 tactics would go beyond the limits of this summary, so we decided to randomly choose three and sum them up in our \u201cKey Lessons\u201d section.\nThe good news?\nWell, Peter Stark and Jane Flaherty have made all of the 101 tactics available for free: you can read everything about each one of them \n and \n.\u00a0\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Only Negotiating Guide You\u2019ll Ever Need\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Negotiating Tactic #1: Is That Your Best Offer?\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Negotiating Tactic #10: Wow! You\u2019ve Got to Be Kidding!\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bonus Tactic #2: Giving Up a Future Draft Choice\nNegotiating Tactic #1: Is That Your Best Offer?\nThis question\u2014\u201dIs that your best offer?\u201d\u2014is Negotiating 101.\u00a0\nA great way to practice your negotiation skills is to simply get in the habit of asking salespeople this question.\u00a0\n\u201cYou would be amazed how many times they will lower their price or throw in an extra benefit in response to this simple question,\u201d write Stark and Flaherty.\nTry it and find out!\nNegotiating Tactic #10: Wow! You\u2019ve Got to Be Kidding!\n\u201cSuccessful negotiators are good at acting surprised,\u201d say Stark and Flaherty.\u00a0\nAnd this is the way they usually express that surprise. It may seem silly, but, in the real world, it really has an effect. It makes your counterpart ask himself \u201cWhat does he know (that I don\u2019t)?\u201d\u2014even when he knows it\u2019s merely a trick.\nIn fact, failing to act surprised when price or conditions are mentioned could result in something you don\u2019t want: your counterpart taking advantage of you.\nBonus Tactic #2: Giving Up a Future Draft Choice\nEveryone who watches the NBA knows what this means: gaining more at the present moment by giving up something in the future.\nFor example, if you really\u2014\n\u2014want to watch the football game tonight even though you promised your girlfriend to take her out to a nice restaurant, maybe you\u2019ll manage to by offering her this kind of deal: \u201cOK. If you let me watch the football game today, I\u2019ll take you out three times during the next week.\u201d\nWe don\u2019t guarantee it will work\u2014but, hey, it\u2019s worth a shot!\u00a0\nThe Jets are on!\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Only Negotiating Guide You\u2019ll Ever Need Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nOne can\u2019t be skeptical enough of books which promise to be \u201cThe Only Book\u201d of their kind one will ever require, but a case can be made for the validity of the title \nfor Peter B. Stark and Jane Flaherty\u2019s primer.\nOf course, you might need many more negotiating guides other than this, but we feel that this is the one you\u2019ll always return to, because it works as a sort of a school book (the first part) and an encyclopedia (the second part).\nDon\u2019t let the print length fool you: there is much more here about negotiation than you could expect to be packed in 300 pages.

And Why?\nDedicated \u201cto the Warrior/Champion within you,\u201d \nis\nfor everyone who wants to become a little more than he is.\u00a0\nIt is a book that reveals the fundamentals of sports mental training\u2014colloquially referred to as \u201cthe science of success\u201d\u2014an often-overlooked aspect of great accomplishments.\u00a0\nEven though athletes should be able to take away much more from the book than people from other walks of life, don\u2019t ignore \neven if you are an artist, a lawyer, or a doctor: everybody needs a little mental training to be better.\nAbout DC Gonzalez\n is a peak performance coach and a bestselling author.\nA former Federal Agent, he has also worked as a military cyber-security specialist and an aviator in the Navy.\nA student of renowned NLP Master Practitioner, P.C. Siegel, Gonzales has trained numerous top athletes, pro-fighters, soldiers, executives, actors, doctors, musicians, lawyers, psychologists to achieve new levels of performance and greatness.\nis his only book so far.\n\u201cThe Art of Mental Training PDF Summary\u201d\n\u201cWhatever is going on inside your head,\u201d writes DC Gonzalez in the introductory \u201cNote\u201d to \n, \u201chas everything to do with how well you end up performing.\u201d\u00a0\nIn a nutshell, that\u2019s what this book is all about: to use Timothy Gallwey\u2019s phrase, it is about \u201c\n.\u201d\nA student of the world-renowned sports and peak performance authority, P.C. Siegel, Daniel Gonzalez is a former Federal Agent, Aviator in the Navy, and Military Cyber-Security Specialist\u2014in addition to being a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Black Belt and a Peak Performance Coach.\nSo, in other words, he has not only the theoretical knowledge but all the experience necessary to turn you into the Warrior/Champion you can become.\nHowever, in \nhe chooses to relay his lessons in a much more communicable way: not via studies and references, but by way of twenty-five story-filled chapters, framed within a single fable\u2014that of DC Gonzalez becoming the Mental Warrior that he is today with the help of his teacher, Leo-tai (correct us if we\u2019re wrong, but we think that P.C. Siegel is hidden behind this name).\nIt\u2019s a Karate Kid type-of-story (the \u201cD\u201d in DC Gonzalez\u2019s stands for Daniel, and Leo-tai \n calls him Daniel-san throughout the book), aimed to teach you that after a certain point, you don\u2019t need to develop your skills anymore, but your mental competence to use them.\nSo, sweeping up the porch and hunting flies with chopsticks is not only useful but also necessary, if you want to become a true Warrior/Champion in your life.\nFind out why!\nThe Three-Minute Lesson\nAs the mental-edge trainer for university athletics, it was easy for DC Gonzalez to notice which athletes wanted the mental training and which athletes didn\u2019t care.\u00a0\nHe starts his book with one of the latter, let\u2019s call him Jeremy, a freshman interested in only the physical aspects of the sport he practiced: wrestling.\nBut then, after being drawn to the top-seeded wrestler in the tournament (\u201ca seasoned senior accustomed to annihilating opponents with comparative ease\u201d), he rushed over to DC and started begging for a quick session of mental training. The pressure had gotten the best of him: he had practically lost the match even before it had begun.\nDC had no more than three minutes to teach him the basics. And that made all the difference! True, in the end, Jeremy didn\u2019t win, but he lost only by a point, taking the top-seeded wrestler to the distance!\n\u201cWhat he did is not difficult,\u201d says DC Gonzalez, \u201cno magic, no hypnosis, no smoke or mirrors.\u00a0 I simply guided him through a process with three simple instructions.\u00a0 I gave him one minute to deal with each instruction, before giving him the next one.\u00a0 In that short time, he was able to change his state completely.\u201d\nThe lesson?\nIt\u2019s all in the head. After all, Jeremy didn\u2019t learn anything wrestling-related per se; and, yet, he evolved from being an already beaten fighter to one capable of challenging the best one in just three minutes!\nDC writes:\nGaining the Mental Edge\nIf you watch soccer, you have probably already heard the name Pel\u00e9.\u00a0\nWidely regarded as one of the best footballers in history, Pel\u00e9 averaged almost a goal per game throughout his career and lead his national team, Brazil, to three World Cup titles.\nOf course, he had exceptional talent, but so did many of the players he played against: Beckenbauer, Puskas, Bobby Moore. And yet, all of them deemed him nothing short of a God.\nSo, what made him different than the rest? \u2013 that\u2019s what DC Gonzalez wondered about for years after watching him play one warm summer night at Tampa Stadium.\nAnd then, he came across a story about him in the writings of the late and great \n, a noted sports mental trainer. In the interview, Pel\u00e9 shared with Mack what he considered to be the two keys to winning \u2013 Enthusiasm and a Mental Edge.\nWhat does that mean in practice?\nIn three words: mental highlight tapes.\nFirst of all, Pel\u00e9, to quote a teammate of his, was \u201calways smiling and upbeat. You never see him bad-tempered.\u201d He had a real enthusiasm for football. He seemed like a guy who\u2019d get up, grab the ball and play a bit even if woken from a deep sleep.\nBut there was more to it.\nYou see, Pel\u00e9 had a routine. Before every game he played, he would go into the locker room about an hour early, reserve a private corner there and lie down using a towel and cover his eyes.\nAnd then, he would start playing \nfilm in his mind\u2019s eye. It was a film about his beginnings, on the sandy beaches of Brazil, the feelings of sheer joy in his heart every time he\u2019d touch the ball. It was also a film about his greatest moment: the dribbles, the assists, the goals. Finally, it was a film about what was going to happen during the game that followed.\n\u201cHe imagined everything before it ever happened,\u201d writes Gonzalez, \u201cthe crowd, the atmosphere, the field, his own team, his opponents, he saw himself playing irresistibly like a champion\u2014as a force that could not be stopped.\u00a0\u00a0But most important, he told Gary, was to remember that it was not just about vision and imagery, but also about feeling the emotions associated with success.\u00a0 He pointed out that he vividly imagined how good it all felt.\u201d\nEnthusiasm and Mental Edge. These two had already prepared Pel\u00e9 for greatness long before the physical stretching. You may call it arrogance, but it is not\u2014it is confidence. And there is a big difference.\u00a0 Confidence is one of the keys to performing well; arrogance\u2014the opposite.\n\u201cOne must consistently practice mental skills and pre-game routines in order to tap one\u2019s full potential,\u201d concludes DC Gonzalez.\nThe Critical Three\nWhat Pel\u00e9 discovered intuitively is something mental trainers no for a fact: \n makes your mind and your body prepared for precisely that kind of a future. From thereon, the equation is pretty straightforward: negative visualizations bring about negative results; positive visualizations result in glory.\nDC Gonzalez writes:\nBut that is only one of \u201cThe Critical Three,\u201d the fundamental tools for the Warrior/Champion according to both Leo-tai and, now, DC Gonzalez!\nThe first of these Critical Three is something you constantly do, but also something you must do properly if you want to prepare for greatness: breathing.\nOf course, we\u2019re not talking about just any kind of breathing: we\u2019re talking about focused breathing, aka the technique most often associated with meditation.\nIt starts with drawing the air in deeply and slowly to the bottom of your lungs through your nose while expanding the diaphragm.\u00a0 Then, after holding it momentarily, you need to slowly push the air out of your lungs by drawing the diaphragm in.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt is important to let the air out through \u201ca relaxed and slightly opened mouth while keeping the tip of the tongue pressed lightly against the ridge behind the front teeth, with the tongue touching the roof of the mouth.\u201d\nIt is just as important to \nthink about anything during the process. Just observe your breathing and pay no attention to anything else. That\u2019s the only way to relax.\nWhich brings us to the second tool of the Critical Three set.\nWe\u2019re talking about both mental and physical relaxation. And we\u2019re also talking about deep relaxation.\nIt is only in the state of deep relaxation that the conscious mind stops controlling everything and makes way for your subconscious mind to take matters in its own hands. And you need this for the final step of the journey: the mental highlights reel.\nWhat does deep relaxation entail?\nWell, more or less, what Pel\u00e9 was doing.\nFirst, it means moving to a quiet place where you can\u2019t be disturbed. So, phones off. Then, lie on your back with your feet slightly apart and your arms slightly extended from your band. Make sure you\u2019re at ease: the place shouldn\u2019t be too cold or too hot, your clothes shouldn\u2019t be tight or uncomfortable.\nNow, fix your eyes on a point above you on the ceiling, and take three long, deep breaths through your nose. Feel the wave of relaxation overwhelming you as you exhale them.\nOnce you exhale the third one, start imagining your eyelids getting heavier. Do so for the length of the next ten breaths, while you\u2019re repeating mentally the word \u201cdeeper.\u201d\u00a0\nNow, it\u2019s time you started relaxing your muscles, starting with your toes and moving upward. Focus on relaxing each of them. Visualize each muscle loosening, and feel the wave of relaxation moving through your body. Allow yourself to be relaxed.\nDon\u2019t rush it, don\u2019t think about it, and don\u2019t force anything. And don\u2019t worry if you fall asleep. In case that happens, imagine a staircase with five steps going up and you slowly climbing up the steps. Tell yourself that you\u2019ll feel \u201cmore refreshed, more alert, and more aware\u201d with each step you take. When you reach the last one, you\u2019ll wake\u2014rejuvenated and ready to take on the day.\nHowever, once again, don\u2019t rush things: allow yourself to be relaxed for about twenty minutes\u2014even a little more than that.\nNow, in the state of deep relaxation, you\u2019ve opened \u201ca direct channel to your subconscious mind,\u201d and you\u2019re ready to \u201cfeed it images and feelings of success.\u201d\nIn other words, you\u2019re ready to write, star in, direct and edit your \u201cmovie,\u201d the one that describes how you\u2019ve accomplished what you have so far and shows how you\u2019ll accomplish even greater things very soon.\nJust 20 minutes of deep relaxation is enough to prepare you for the final step of your journey to mental preparedness. Imagineering has to come from within you because only then it actually affects motivation and volition.\nShow your goals and objectives to the conscious mind, and it will find thousands of reasons not to believe them. Show them to your subconscious mind, and it accepts the input as being true. Afterward, it sets out to help you make it come true.\nYup, that\u2019s what DC Gonzalez is saying: \u201cFake it until you make it.\u201d But that actually works. After all, it is what one of the greatest authorities on our subconscious mind, Timothy Wilson, has demonstrated in \n.\nDC Gonzalez concludes:\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Art of Mental Training\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Enthusiasm and Mental Edge Are Keys to Winning (Says Pel\u00e9)\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Fundamentals of Mental Training: The Critical Three\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Three-Minute Lesson, Revisited\nEnthusiasm and Mental Edge Are Keys to Winning (Says Pel\u00e9)\nThis is how Guardiola, one of the greatest football coaches in history, motivates young players when necessary: \u201cEach night when you are going to sleep,\u201d \n, \u201cask yourselves if, right then, you\u2019d get up, grab the ball and play for a bit. If ever the answer is \u2018no\u2019 then that is the day to start looking for something else to do.\u201d\nBecause the key to winning is not merely talent or hard work\u2014it\u2019s also enthusiasm. If you want to do something, you will do it better.\nAnd if you want to excel at it, use the routine practiced by Pel\u00e9 before each of his games: imagine yourself excelling. Play out the game in your head before you even run out to the field. Because that\u2019s how you get a mental edge.\nThe Fundamentals of Mental Training: The Critical Three\n\u201cThe Mental Warrior learns about focused breathing, relaxation, and imagery,\u201d said once his teacher to DC Gonzalez, \u201cand then he sets off to actually use them.\u201d\nBecause these are the critical three tools to achieving greatness. Set aside between half an hour and an hour before each game for a routine which includes these three aspects of mental training.\nThat way, you\u2019ll convince yourself that you\u2019re ready for whatever comes next. And your subconscious mind will do everything to help you when the moment of truth comes.\nThe Three-Minute Lesson, Revisited\nRemember Jeremy, the wrestler DC Gonzalez transformed with a three-minute talk before his first match?\nWell, Gonzalez comes back to the story later in the book and reveals what he had actually told him. Unsurprisingly, it has a lot to do with the three critical elements explained above, this time, compressed and put into impromptu use.\n\u201c\n,\u201d DC Gonzalez said to Jeremy. \u201cWhatever state that may be, your own thoughts put you there.\u00a0\u201c\n\u201cSo, whenever you find yourself in a disempowered state remember this,\u201d he goes on, \u201cyou can alter your thoughts and your state by focusing on three different critical elements:\u201d\n\u2022 \n: Ask yourself, \u201cWhat would the self-talk of a champion sound like as he prepared for competition?\u201d If you need some inspiration, here\u2019s what Gonzalez told Jeremy to use as the basis for his pep-talk: \u201cI\u2019m strong, I\u2019m fast, and I dominate.\u00a0 I control the match, I never give in, and I never give up.\u00a0 I\u2019m powerful, I\u2019m a force of fury, I\u2019m a force of dominance, and I am a champion.\u201d\n\u2022 \n: Ask yourself, \u201cHow would a champion\u2019s body be moving as he prepared for battle?\u201d Even if \n, it certainly shapes how your opponent sees you, right?\n\u2022 \n: Ask yourself, \u201cAnd how would that champion be breathing as he prepared to enter the competition and face his opponent?\u201d You have the answer above.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Art of Mental Training Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nis neither a long book nor one that is a difficult read.

And Why?\nSteve Jobs is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable icons of the computer revolution and the 20\n century as a whole. Yet, as it often happens in the case of great men who create history, not much is known about him when it comes to more common, more everyday, and let\u2019s just say, more banal things.\nLisa Brennan-Jobs, one of Steve\u2019s three daughters (and four children in all), tells her story in \n, a book that has surely already piqued the fancy of all those Mac fans out there, and a book that will certainly interest anyone who wants to learn something more about how Steve Jobs was as a father.\nBe prepared, however: if you love Jobs, this book may plant a seed of doubt in your heart; and if you hate him\u2014then here you\u2019ll find quite a lot to criticize him about.\nAbout Lisa Brennan-Jobs\n is an American writer, the first (and long-time unacknowledged) child of Steve Jobs.\nA Harvard graduate based in Brooklyn, she has written for several newspapers and magazines, including \n \nand \nFind out more at \n \n\u201cSmall Fry PDF Summary\u201d\nYou know him as the man who brought you Macintosh, Pixar, and the iPod, you know him as the creative genius who started the microchip revolution of the 1970s. But do you know him as a father of four children?\nOne of them\u2014the first, in fact\u2014Lisa Brennan-Jobs decided to recount to the world her side of the story of Jobs in the tellingly titled memoir, \n.\nThe title is taken from Shakespeare\u2019s \n and refers to the hierarchy of fish: just as is among the people, says one fisherman to another in the plays, \u201cthe great ones eat up the little ones\u201d in the sea as well. The former are whales, the latter small fry.\nYou can guess which one of the two was Steve, and which one Lisa Brennan-Jobs.\nHere\u2019s the full explanation why!\nLisa Brennan-Jobs, the Accidental Daughter That Shouldn\u2019t Have Been\nIn the spring of 1972, in his senior year at Homestead High School in Cupertino, California, Steve Jobs met Chrisann Brennan, a junior. Very soon he won her love, courtesy of Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cSad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands,\u201d and a little assisting on a Claymation she and her friends were working on at the time.\nSoon after, Job left for Reed College in Oregon, and by 1973, their relationship was, to use a popular adjective, complicated. \u201cI couldn\u2019t break the connection, and I couldn\u2019t commit,\u201d says Chrisann about that time. \u201cSteve couldn\u2019t either.\u201d\nLittle by little, the two separated, but they couldn\u2019t break up completely for the next few years. \u201cI had suggested to Steve that we separate,\u201d said Chrisann many years later, \u201cbut he told me that he just couldn\u2019t bring himself to say good-bye.\u201d\u00a0\nTheir on-again-off-again relationship would eventually result in something neither of them expected: just when they were about to break up, Chrisann found out that she was pregnant.\nAfter finding out the news, Steve\u2019s face turned ugly, and he left the room furious and fuming. It was soon after that he started declining paternity. He wasn\u2019t even present at the birth of Lisa on a friend\u2019s farm in Organ.\nWhen he eventually came a few days later, Steve started telling everyone at the farm that the kid is not his, even though she sure looked like him according to everyone present.\nDenying Paternity and Paying $0 for Child Support\u2014Until Apple Goes IPO\nSteve continued to deny paternity of Lisa for years, and Chrisann had no choice but to break up with him and raise their daughter alone.\u00a0\nShe wanted to become a painter, but there was no time for that: she went on welfare and started earning additional money with waitressing and house cleaning jobs. Steve barely even visited her. Needless to add, he didn\u2019t even bother helping her financially.\nConsequently, in 1980, Chrisann sued Steve for not paying child support, and as a result, a DNA paternity test was arranged. The results were conclusive: he was Lisa\u2019s father with 94.4% certainty.\nThe court of San Mateo\u2014case filed under number 239948\u2014ordered Jobs to cover all welfare back payments (about $6,000) and to pay a monthly allowance of $385 for Lisa, in addition to medical insurance until her 18\n birthday.\nThe case dragged on for months, and then, suddenly, Steve, via his lawyers, offered to start paying $500 per month for Lisa and cover her health insurance until 18, effectively bringing the case to a close in just a few days.\u00a0\nChrisann didn\u2019t know why he had rushed the case to a conclusion, but she didn\u2019t have to wait long to find out: only four days after it was finalized, on December 12, 1980, Apple went public and overnight my Steve was worth more than two hundred million dollars.\nBeing the Girl with all the A\u2019s and No Marketable Skills\nChrisann loved Lisa, but, as time passed, she was growing ever more frustrated with her life: while she was struggling to make ends meet, almost friendless and alone, Steve Jobs became \n \u201cPerson of the Year,\u201d and the whole world found out that Chrisann was someone who slept around, so their child could always be someone else\u2019s despite the results of the DNA test.\nOf course, this reflected on Lisa and, one day, when she was 13 years old, her school had no choice but to call Lisa\u2019s completely disinterested father, Steve, to take her in; otherwise, they said, they would have no option but to call Social Services.\nLisa had always hoped that one day she would be able to live with her famous father and, now, that actually came true.\nThere was one condition, though: she wasn\u2019t allowed to contact her mother during the following six months.\nLisa agreed to this, as she did to the offer of changing her surname. She didn\u2019t want to hurt her mother, though, so she took both of her parents\u2019 surnames, and became Lisa Brennan-Jobs.\nLiving with Steve and his new family\u2014his new wife Lauren and their son, Reed\u2014was never the picnic Lisa had hoped her. For example, no matter how much she tried impressing her father\u2014by excelling at school and taking countless extracurricular activities\u2014Steve was never particularly impressed with her.\nOn the contrary, in fact: he regularly told her that she will probably never amount to anything in her life, even after Lisa eventually got into Harvard.\u00a0\n\u201cThe thing is, Lis,\u201d he said to her once, in a slow voice which always meant that he was about to say something incisive and devastating, \u201cyou have no marketable skills. Not one.\u201d\nDrifting Apart for the Second Time\nThough begrudgingly, Steve Jobs agreed to pay for Lisa\u2019s Harvard tuition after she got in. But he hadn\u2019t changed his mind over her future. In fact, he kept making quite cruel jokes about it.\nFor example, several times, while driving by it with Lauren next to him and Lisa and Reed in the back, he would point in the direction of a squat building with \u201cRuby\u2019s\u201d marquee on it, and say something along the lines of \u201cThat\u2019s where Lis is going to work.\u201d\nYears later, Lisa found out that \u201cRuby\u2019s\u201d was a strip club. She writes in \n:\nIn other words, Steve Jobs wanted to start a tech revolution and didn\u2019t want to raise a child. When Lisa happened, he decided to ignore the event. And even after he succeeded and was worth millions, Lisa was still a blot on what he believed was an exceptional life.\u00a0\nPossibly to erase the guilt he was secretly feeling, Steve kept saying to Lisa things like \u201cYou\u2019re not being part of this family.\u201d Once he said this after Lisa refused to go with the family to a Cirque du Soleil show. What followed was something even stranger: \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t want to be, then you need to move.\u201d\nAnd just like that, Lisa had no choice but to move.\n(The Light at) The End of the Road\nBelieve it or not, after that Cirque du Soleil event, Steve severed ties with Lisa altogether! He even stopped paying her Harvard tuition.\u00a0\nFortunately, Steve\u2019s neighbors, the exemplary Kevin and Dorothy, took Lisa under their wings. They not only offered her a place to stay, but Kevin also paid for her final year\u2019s tuition so that she can graduate from Harvard!\nSteve Jobs just disappeared: no messages, no phone calls, no responses to any of Lisa\u2019s emails. It went on like that for a while, but then the contact was renewed. After Lisa graduated, Steve paid Kevin for everything he had financed for Lisa.\nYears later, Steve Jobs was sick with cancer, and Lisa realized that she was about to lose her father. She visited him often, and he used one of these opportunities to apologize to her for the way he had treated her.\nFortunately, by that time, Lisa could be much surer that he wasn\u2019t lying. In 2005, six years before Jobs succumbed to cancer, they went to visit Bono at his villa.\nBono was interested in finding more about the beginning of Apple. And, then suddenly, he posed a question Lisa had rarely dared to: \u201cSo was the Lisa computer named after her?\u201d\n\u201cThere was a pause,\u201d she writes. \u201cI braced myself\u2014prepared for his answer.\u201d Chrisann had always insisted that the computer was named after her, but both Steve and Lauren denied this.\u00a0\nAt Bono\u2019s villa, Steve hesitated for a few moments, looked down at his plate, and then looked back at Bono. \u201cYeah, it was,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI studied my father\u2019s face,\u201d Lisa goes on. \u201cWhat had changed? Why had he admitted it now, after all these years?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the first time he\u2019s said yes,\u201d Lisa told Bono. \u201cThank you for asking.\u201d\u00a0\nKey Lessons from \u201cSmall Fry\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Steve Jobs Never Wanted to Admit Paternity of Lisa\u2026 Even After a DNA Test\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Steve Jobs Started Paying Alimony for Lisa Only Because of Apple\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Apple Lisa Was Named After Lisa Brennan-Jobs\nSteve Jobs Never Wanted to Admit Paternity of Lisa\u2026 Even After a DNA Test\nSteve Jobs didn\u2019t want to have a daughter with Chrisann Brennan, a painter. However, that happened: due to the body of Chrisann rejecting a contraceptive, she got pregnant in 1977 and gave birth to Lisa Brennan-Jobs next year, at 23.\nThis was not part of Steve Jobs\u2019 plans at the time, which is why he started publicly denying paternity. Because of this, Chrisann ended the relationship with him and started working as a cleaning lady to earn enough money for her and Lisa. Steve Jobs contributed with nothing.\nFinally, a DNA paternity test established that he is the father with 94.4% certainty. It didn\u2019t matter: he refused to acknowledge the test, claiming, in a subsequent interview for \nmagazine that \u201c28% of the male population of the United States could be the father.\u201d\nSteve Jobs Started Paying Alimony for Lisa Only Because of Apple\nSince Jobs was so sure that he wasn\u2019t the father of Lisa, he refused to pay alimony for her. Even more: he claimed that her mother didn\u2019t even want the money but him, as if that is some kind of a monstrous thing.\nAnd then, suddenly, even though Chrisann had asked for $385 a month, Steve Jobs agreed to pay to her $500 a month. Not because of some newfound fatherly feelings. Apple was supposed to go public in four days: little did anyone know that Jobs was about to become a multimillionaire.\nApple Lisa Was Named After Lisa Brennan-Jobs\nDespite his public rejection of Lisa, privately, Steve had feelings for her. People said that he carried a picture of her in his wallet. Even more, he named one of the earliest GUI-based computers after her: Apple Lisa.\nOf course, he claimed for most of his life that it is merely an acronym for \u201cLocally Integrated Software Architecture,\u201d but, during a discussion with U2\u2019s Bono (at which Lisa was also present), Jobs confirmed that Apple Lisa was named after his daughter.\nHe confirmed that story publicly near the end of his life for Walter Isaacson\u2019s majestic biography, \n: \u201cobviously, it was named for my daughter,\u201d he admitted.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cSmall Fry Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nEver since Lisa Brennan-Jobs announced that she was writing a memoir of her upbringing \n, \nbecame one of the most anticipated books of recent times. Six months later, the book was published\u2014and, in our opinion, it turned out to be precisely what we expected to be.\nHonest, direct, brutal, and iconoclastic, but also quite touching and heartbreaking, \nhas what many memoirs don\u2019t: an exceptional subject matter. And it treats it the way it deserves: vividly and accurately, but also tenderly and affectionately.\u00a0\nWhen you finish the book, you\u2019re bound to spend some time thinking along the lines of a \n article, which appeared just before the book was published: \u201c\n\u201d\nYou decide."},

If \n and \n, it\u2019s not impossible to achieve, in time, well, the impossible.\nIn \n, Deepak Chopra and Rudolph Tanzi reveal several ways through which you can tap into this amazing power and put this wasted potential to use.\nAnd here are our highlights!\nAdding a Neuron or Two to Your Brain Is Not That Difficult\nRemember that time when you came home drunk, and your father told you the next morning that you\u2019ve lost overnight thousands of neurons in your brain?\nWell, he was right. But the truth\u2014the whole truth\u2014is that he was also very wrong.\nWe lose about 85,000 neurons a day, regardless of our drinking habits! That may sound like a large number, but, in reality, it\u2019s nothing: there are around 100 billion neurons in your brain!\nIn other words, at this loss rate, you\u2019ll be able to live the life of a brilliant mathematician even if \n! In simpler terms, there are just enough neurons in your brain to get you through life even if they don\u2019t regenerate!\nDid we just say \u201ceven if\u201d?\nYes, we did!\nThe notion that the brain cells are the only cells in our body that don\u2019t regenerate is, according to Chopra and Tanzi, just another myth. In reality, the human brain creates new cells all the time.\nAnd studies have conclusively demonstrated this!\nFor example, neurologist Paul Coleman of the University of Rochester discovered that, despite the loss rate of 85,000 neurons per day, the brains of a twenty-year-old and a seventy-year-old person have pretty much the same number of functioning neurons!\nBut, then again, some old people have more functioning neurons than others.\nWhy is that?\nBecause they have trained them better!\nJust like your body needs physical exercise if you want to get a six-pack, your brain needs some mental exercise to develop extra neurons. This happens at a faster rate when you\u2019re faced with a new assignment, such as a math problem or a new language.\nAnd humans are not the only species where this has been observed!\nFor example, an average male zebra finch, the most common Australian bird of its kind, has more brain neurons during the mating season because it must learn new songs to attract the females.\nThe Two Es: Exercising and Experiencing\nTrue, mental exercise does wonders to the structure of your brain, but, \n, physical exercise boosts brain power as well.\u00a0\nIt may seem counter-intuitive, but it is an undeniable fact that people who are more active are far less likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease in their old age.\nBut it\u2019s more than that:\nThere is yet another way to help your cells become part of the world: by allowing them to experience new things and opinions.\nMost people do the exact opposite: they follow a certain routine and don\u2019t want to go outside the filter bubble they are trapped in. After all, it \n safer that way: evolution has taught us that it is always better to stick with the known than explore the unknown: the former means safety, the latter may mean danger.\nHowever, it is the 21\n century, and things have certainly changed! There are no more mammoths or saber-toothed tigers roaming around, nor it is dangerous to talk to someone you don\u2019t agree with. In fact, \n.\nSo, do that!\u00a0\nGo out, travel, read, talk to people who hold opinions opposite of yours!\u00a0\nYour brain will love that!\nThe Benefits of a Super Brain\nTurning your brain into a super brain won\u2019t get you superpowers of the kind depicted in \nand \n. But it may help you take control of some of your habits and become a happier, more fulfilled person.\u00a0\nAnd what could be more important than that?\u00a0\nAfter all, what is life itself, but a series of habits?\nHere are three benefits of developing a super brain!\nWe look the way we do, and our brain works the way it does because of evolution. However, evolving was such a long process which had to take care of so many things that it isn\u2019t at all surprising that sometimes our bodies can work against us.\nThe case of staying closed to new experiences because we\u2019ve evolved to prefer safety over vulnerability isn\u2019t the only one. As we\u2019ve only recently discovered, your inability to stick to a diet may be another case when your body works against you.\nWhy?\nBecause of a hormone called \u201cghrelin.\u201d\nAustralian scientists found out that this hormone\u2014referred colloquially as \u201cthe hunger hormone\u201d\u2014starts producing when you lose weight and makes you feel desperately hungry. That\u2019s the feeling you get after being on a diet for a few months.\nYou see the vicious circle: once you lose some weight, ghrelin starts producing and says to you that you\u2019re hungry, and, before you know it, you gain the lost weight once again!\nHowever, you can control this feedback loop by merely controlling the thought process. Ghrelin says that you\u2019re hungry? Start replying: \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d In time, it will stop producing\u2014after all, almost all commands come from the same place, your brain.\n\u201cThe first rule of super brain is that your brain is always eavesdropping on your thoughts,\u201d write Chopra and Tanzi. \u201cAs it listens, it learns. If you teach it about limitation, your brain will become limited. But what if you do the opposite? What if you teach your brain to be unlimited?\u201d\nSpeaking of limitations, one of the obvious ones is not being able to predict the result of some of our actions. We know what will happen if we drop a glass to the floor, but we have no idea what will happen if we vote for a certain person at next year\u2019s elections.\nWell, not exactly!\nThere is something inside us that is able to predict the future. We call it intuition, and though we don\u2019t know how it works, it seems to be working quite well. As Tim Wilson demonstrated \n(something Malcolm Gladwell popularized in \n), sometimes we think better when we don\u2019t think at all.\nChopra and Tanzi tell of an experiment during which participants were asked to look at some photographs, only a few of which depicted a violent scene. Naturally, the mere look at one of these violent images incited stressful responses in the participants, and the extent of these responses was properly registered by relevant devices.\nAfter some time, something strange happened: people started feeling these things microseconds before the violent images appeared on the screen. And only then!\nHow did they know?\nIs it possible that we can know about the future more than we think we can? Is our brain capable of seeing into it\u2014but we still don\u2019t know how to exploit this power?\nTrain your brain through mental and physical exercises, tap into its power through healthy eating habits and being open to new experiences, and yet, you might end up being just a smart, lonely individual or, to be brutally honest, an unhappy intellectual with a wife and two children.\nWhy would you need to train your brain for that?\nAristotle was the first one to suggest that \n and that everything else is merely a way to achieve it. And very few have disagreed with him throughout the past twenty-five centuries.\u00a0\nWell, Chopra and Tanzi start from there and explain how the reason why so many people are unhappy today (despite a million-dollar industry related to happiness and thousands of books which explore it) is actually quite straightforward: the definition of happiness our brains are infested with is fundamentally wrong.\nMost people, you see, equate happiness with external factors: finding the perfect partner, having children, earning a million dollars, becoming a famous person. The truth is that none of these things will bring you happiness even if you obtain them, because happiness lives inside your brain.\nIn other words, happiness is the result of aligning your goals to your personal values\u2014and nothing more! This may mean for someone raising horses, and for another person reading poetry. There is no universally applicable equation!\nTake Brendon Grimshaw, for example. He was quite a successful journalist, but he decided to quit his job because it wasn\u2019t as fulfilling as he had hoped for. Then he bought an abandoned tropical island (the Moyenne Island in the Indian Ocean) and became its personal caretaker.\nDuring the next few decades, Grimshaw turned this island into a wildlife refuge for many animals (such as the giant tortoise) by constantly planting mahogany trees there.\nSome would say that living such a solitary life (he was the island\u2019s only inhabitant) is anything but happiness, but not Grimshaw: the moment he left, he never looked back. He stayed there until 2012, when he died a happy man.\nThe lesson?\nFind your island of happiness, and move there!\nKey Lessons from \u201cSuper Brain\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Brain Constantly Loses and Creates Neurons\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Fight Alzheimer By Exercising Regularly\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Develop a Super Brain by Learning New Languages and Experiencing More\nThe Brain Constantly Loses and Creates Neurons\nOn average, your brain loses about 85,000 neurons a day!\nThe good thing is that it has about 100 billion of them, so it\u2019s not such a big loss.\nAn even better thing is that the brain of a 20-year-old and that of a 70-year-old person have pretty much the same number of neurons.\nHow\u2019s that possible?\nYou\u2019ve guessed it alright: just as it loses, the brain also regenerates and recreates neurons on a daily basis.\nFight Alzheimer By Exercising Regularly\nIt is not at all surprising that mental exercises (solving math problems or playing chess, for example) creates neurons.\nBut studies have shown that the same holds true for physical exercising as well.\nIn fact, it is one of the few proven ways to fight Alzheimer: the more regularly you exercise while you are young, the less likely to develop Alzheimer in your old age.\nDevelop a Super Brain by Learning New Languages and Experiencing More\nScientists have observed that the brains of zebra finches (an Australian bird) grow larger during the mating season because it has to learn new songs to attract mates.\nThe same thing applies to humans: the more you use your brain, the better it works.\nSo, learn new songs and languages, read, write, and experience new things as often as you can!

And Why?\nis for everyone who doesn\u2019t know what the four agreements are and who thinks that \u201clearning more about more\u201d should be one of his/her life\u2019s objectives.\nIt is also for everyone who thinks that he/she is imperfect and that he/she might never become a better version of himself/herself.\nAbout Don Miguel Ruiz\n is a bestselling Mexican author who dubs himself a Toltec shaman.\nHe debuted in 1997 with \n. The book remained a bestseller for the next decade and brought Ruiz fame and, among other things, a few guest appearances at Oprah.\nWhat followed was a series of \u201cToltec Wisdom Books\u201d (\n)\nwhich made Ruiz one of the most respected spiritualistic teachers of the modern age.\u00a0\nFind out more at \n.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Voice of Knowledge PDF Summary\u201d\nThey say that knowledge is power.\nDon Miguel Ruiz thinks that this is one of the many lies you\u2019re fed with on a daily basis.\n\u201cWhat is truth is real,\u201d he writes in the epigraph to \n. \u201cWhat is not truth is not real. It\u2019s an illusion, but it looks real. Love is real. It\u2019s the supreme expression of life.\u201d\nAnd love is precisely what is at stake: due to the many lies we\u2019ve grown to believe to be true in our lives, we have forgotten how to love and, with that, how to live as well.\nThe voice of knowledge from the title of Don Miguel Ruiz\u2019s 2004 book is not, as you might expect, a voice of God; it is, actually, the voice of the prince of darkness separating you from your very own self.\nConsequently, it is one you should almost never listen to.\nAnd here\u2019s why in detail.\nThe Symbolic Meaning of the Story of Adam and Eve\nSince everybody knows the story, we can sum it up in just a few sentences:\nSo, Adam and Eve were created by God, placed in the Garden of Eden, and told that the only thing they are not allowed to do is eat from the Tree of Death, aka the Tree of Knowledge. Of course, they did just that, and, before you can say \u201cwhy, God, why?\u201c they fell from grace and became ordinary suffering humans.\nExpectedly, Don Miguel Ruiz is interested in the story from a different perspective. \u201cIt explains with symbolism what I will try to explain with words,\u201d he says in the first chapter of \n\u201cThe story of Adam and Eve,\u201d he goes on, \u201cis based on absolute truth, though I never understood it as a child. It is one of the greatest teachings ever, but I believe that most people misunderstand it.\u201d\nThe story is, in fact, he says, about \n: Adam and Eve were every single human being that existed at the time of Creation, so the story is not about them exclusively, but about humanity in general.\nAnd it says this:\nWe are born innocent and in Paradise; everything is about joy, freedom, and eternal love when we are children; we live in perfect harmony with all of creation.\nBut then, the Prince of Lies sneaks in from somewhere and, bringing a message of fear, convinces us to try the tempting fruits from the Tree of Knowledge. The fruits of knowledge are poisonous because they bring with them thousands of lies. The minute we start eating these fruits, the lies start living \n us.\n\u201cThe mind is fertile ground for concepts, ideas, and opinions,\u201d writes Ruiz. \u201cIf someone tells us a lie and we believe it, that lie takes root in our mind and can grow big and strong, like a tree. One little lie can be very contagious, spreading its seeds from person to person when we share it with others.\u201d\nThe Simple Truth of Existence (and Miguel\u2019s Visit to His Grandfather)\nWhen Miguel was a teenager, he once went to visit his grandfather in an attempt to share with him what he had learned at school.\u00a0\nHis grandfather, a shaman nearly 90 years of age at the time, listened very carefully to Miguel\u2019s stories \u201cabout all of the injustice in the world, about the poverty, about the violence, about the conflict between good and what [he] then called evil.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Miguel, those are very good theories that you\u2019ve learned,\u201d his grandfather replied. \u201cBut they are only theories. Everything you have told me is just a story. It doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s true.\u201d\nNow it was Ruiz\u2019s turn to listen. And his grandfather started explaining to him:\nMiguel was startled and surprised. But that\u2019s not where his grandfather ended his story.\nInstead, he proceeded to explain how humans overcomplicate things, and how this is also the result of lies, the biggest one among them that we are not created perfect.\nIt\u2019s the other way around: we are created perfect, but we fall from grace because, through our knowledge, we let lies infest our being. And they gradually separate us from ourselves, because we start believing in them and stop believing in us.\nThe only way for us to know the truth is by experiencing it. Everything else is just a product of our mind, which can never be free of lies.\u00a0\n\u201cWe can perceive truth with our feelings, but as soon as we try to describe it with words, we distort it, and it\u2019s no longer the truth,\u201d said Miguel\u2019s grandfather to the teenage Ruiz.\u00a0\nAnd at that moment, he knew that he had experienced something that would eventually evolve into this book.\nThe Lie of Our Imperfection\nThis, the lie of our imperfection, is the big lie, the one undermining everyone\u2019s existence, the one causing the chaos in the world.\nWhen we are children, writes Ruiz, we are completely in tune with our selves. We are authentic and never try to pretend that we are something we are not. We are, simply put, incapable of it.\n\u201cWhen the child was a child,\u201d to quote the exquisitely beautiful movie, \n, \u201cit didn\u2019t know that it was a child: to it, everything had a soul, and all souls were one. When the child was a child, it had no opinion about anything, had no habits\u2026 and made no faces when photographed.\u201d\nWell, this all changes when we become mature enough to be capable of learning abstract things and ideas. Because with them comes the emptiness as well: suddenly, we get the feeling that some people know more about the world than us and that we lack something (i.e., knowledge).\nAnd we start inventing stories about what is good and what is bad, about what is love and what is hate, about who we are and what we are not. Of course, all of them are nothing more than stories: just like one who has never experienced love can never understand it if merely described, we can never understand anything (even ourselves) if we don\u2019t experience it in entirety.\nThink of it this way:\u00a0\nIf, theoretically, a single individual is drawn by Leonardo da Vinci, Picasso, and Dali, few would be able to guess that their portraits depict the same person.\nWhy?\nBecause they all see that person in a different way, noticing very different things in him/her.\nAnd that\u2019s how much our stories differ. Some are more appealing to the majority, while others can only be appreciated by a selected minority. This doesn\u2019t make them true. In fact, nothing does. They will always be nothing more than stories.\n\u201cHumans are born in truth,\u201d notes Don Miguel Ruiz, \u201cbut we grow up believing in lies. One of the biggest lies in the story of humanity is the lie of our imperfection. It\u2019s just a story, but we believe it, and we use the story to judge ourselves, to punish ourselves, and to justify our mistakes.\u201d\nBe the Storyteller of Your Life\nTo sum up the argument so far:\nJust like Adam and Eve, we are created perfect. This must be true, because we are created by God in His image, and God is necessarily perfect. And we know this for a fact \n as children.\nHowever, we start forgetting this as soon as we start listening to the voice of knowledge, which Ruiz describes as a wild horse taking us wherever \n wants to go.\nThe voice of knowledge exposes us to the illusion of what the world is: we start believing things that we have never experienced, and the real knowledge can only come through experience. So, in other words, with the voice of knowledge come the lies.\nThe greatest one among them: that we are imperfect by birth and need to spend a lot of time and energy to perfect ourselves.\n\u201cWhat you call \n,\u201d writes Ruiz, \u201cis the voice of knowledge making up stories, telling you what you know, and trying to make sense out of everything you don\u2019t know. The problem is that the voice makes you do many things that go against yourself.\u201d\nYou can change that!\nMerely knowing that \u201cyou are the author of an ongoing story you tell yourself\u201d is a great start. Because the good thing about stories is that they can be \n.\nThe main character of \nstory is, of course, none other than you. Everyone else is a secondary character whose story, in relation to you, depends upon the story you believe you are in.\n\u201cThe only way to change your story is to change what you believe about yourself,\u201d writes Ruiz. \u201cIf you clean up the lies you believe about yourself, the lies you believe about everybody else will change. Every time you change the main character of your story, the whole story changes to adapt to the new main character.\u201d\nKnowing that you are a character in a story helps in fashioning a better relationship to the people around you.\nIn their stories, you are a secondary character, just as they are in yours. If you try to write their story for them, you don\u2019t respect them. If they try to write your story for you\u2014they don\u2019t respect you.\nWe are born to write only \n perfect story: that of ourselves. So, don\u2019t waste your time taking anything personally: when other people are interacting with you, they are really interacting with the secondary characters in their story.\nAnd even Shakespeare wasn\u2019t that great in creating three-dimensional secondary characters.\u00a0\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Voice of Knowledge\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We Are Born Perfect\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Voice of Knowledge Interferes with Our Experience of Ourselves\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You Can Write Your Own Story\nWe Are Born Perfect\nSince God is perfect, perfect is the only form in which he could have fashioned us.\u00a0\nConsequently, the greatest lie ever told is the one of our imperfection: we cannot be someone else even if we tried.\n\u201cWe are born perfect, we grow up perfect, and we will die perfect, because only perfection exists,\u201d writes Ruiz trying to recapture the words of his grandfather, a shaman.\u00a0\n\u201cBut the big lie is that you are not perfect, that nobody is perfect. So you start to search for an \n of perfection that you can never become. You will never reach perfection in that way because that image is false. It\u2019s a lie, but you invest your faith in that lie, and then you build a whole structure of lies to support it.\u201d\nThe Voice of Knowledge Interferes with Our Experience of Ourselves\nTruth can only be experienced. When put into words, it is not truth anymore: it is merely a distorted version of the experience.\nWhen we are children, we know this very well: we live in the present, and we live authentically. We are what we are: beings full of love and innocence.\nHowever, once we grow mature enough to understand abstract things, we start \ntoo much. And we start believing that there are all kinds of things in the world which affect us: what is just and what is unjust, what is good and what is bad, what is beautiful and what is ugly.\nThese things, however, don\u2019t exist in the world: they are not real for the flowers or the stars or the lions. In other words, they are a product of our minds.\nInstead of working for us, as soon as we separate them from our experiences, our minds start working against us, concocting stories which are false and which infest our happiness.\nYou Can Write Your Own Story\nThe good thing is that we can always rewrite our story\u2014using our point of view as the be-all and end-all.\n\u201cAll humans create their story with their own unique point of view,\u201d writes Ruiz. \u201cWhy try to impose your story on other people when for them your story is not true? When you understand that, you no longer have the need to defend what you believe. It\u2019s not important to be right or to make others wrong.\u201d\n\u201cInstead, you see everybody as an artist, a storyteller. You know that whatever they believe is just their point of view. It has nothing to do with you.\u201d\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Voice of Knowledge Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nIt\u2019s difficult to see what new \ncould offer to all those millions of people already familiar with Don Miguel Ruiz\u2019s debut books, \n and \n.\nPublished one year before \n, the book does seem to anticipate the (so far) final agreement (\u201cbe skeptical but learn to listen\u201d) by suggesting that knowledge has done us more harm than favors and that we need to question the lessons we\u2019ve learned.\nBut, other than that, it does seem like one of the books in Ruiz\u2019s oeuvre, one can safely skip without fear of missing out on anything important."},

Are you, in addition to that, a Christian?\nThen you should allow Timothy Keller to explain to you:\n.\nWho Should Read \u201cThe Meaning of Marriage\u201d? And Why?\n, as Timothy Keller reveals in the \u201cIntroduction,\u201d is a book for married and unmarried people, but also a book about the Bible.\u00a0\nSince, as he says further on, \u201cthe foundation of it all is the Bible,\u201d the book is primarily aimed for Christians, be they single, married, or divorce. In fact, it explicitly excludes members of the LGBT+ community by the very definition of marriage it proposes in the \u201cIntroduction.\u201d So, read it if you think that marriage is (also) about God; don\u2019t\u2014if you think otherwise.\u00a0\nshould also appeal to more religious fans of John Gottman and his two most famous books: \nand \nAbout Timothy Keller\n is an American Christian pastor, apologist, and theologian.\nThe founding pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City, Keller is most famous as the author of several best-selling books, most notably \nand \n.\nQuite Appropriately, Keller has written \n with the help of his wife, Kathy Keller.\nFind out more at \n\u00a0\n\u201cThe Meaning of Marriage PDF Summary\u201d\nBased \u201con a straightforward reading of Biblical texts,\u201d \n examines \u201cthe Christian understanding of marriage.\u201d\u00a0\nMeaning\u2014whenever we mention the word \u201cmarriage\u201d below, we\u2019ll be talking about, in the words of the author, \u201ca lifelong, monogamous relationship between a man and a woman.\u201d\u00a0\nKeller explains his definition further, thus:\nThe substance of \ndraws on St. Paul\u2019s thoughts on marriage expressed in Ephesians 5:18-33, and, in fact, each (but one) of its eight chapters begin with a quote taken from this passage, quoted in full as an epigraph to the book.\nEverything else, as you\u2019ll see in our summary, is basically a commentary on St. Paul.\nOne: The Secret of Marriage\nThe epigraph to Chapter 1, \u201cThe Secret of Marriage\u201d is Ephesians 5:31-32: \u201cA man shall leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. This is a profound mystery\u2026\u201d\nKeller tries to explain away this mystery as the miracle of \u201ctwo flawed people coming together to create a space of stability, love, and consolation\u2014a haven in a heartless world.\u201d It is a difficult task, and, unfortunately, it has been made even more difficult by modern understandings of marriage.\nThe evidence abounds: today, there are twice as many divorces as in 1960; only two-thirds of all births today are to married parents, and only 1 in 10 children was born to unmarried parents just half a century ago. Finally, and most tellingly, over 72% of American adults were married in 1960, but only 50% were in 2008.\nThe reason?\nWell, the unfortunate movement from \u201cwe\u201d to \u201cme.\u201d \u201cMarriage used to be a public institution for the common good,\u201d writes Keller, \u201cand now it is a private arrangement for the satisfaction of the individuals. Marriage used to be about us, but now it is about me.\u201d\nIronically, it is this newfound freedom in marriage (\n) that has made spouses a little less free than before and much unhappier.\u00a0\nNowadays, you can marry everyone you want, and because of Disney and Hollywood, you expect to find \u201cthe perfectly compatible person.\u201d It\u2019s either that or nothing. The problem is \u201cperfect\u201d doesn\u2019t exist, so many are left with nothing, \u201cdesperately trapped between both unrealistic longings for and terrible fears about marriage.\u201d\nDon\u2019t believe Keller?\nHere\u2019s a curious stat: two-thirds of unhappy marriages should become happy within half a decade if people opt to stay married over getting divorced!\nTwo: The Power for Marriage\nChapter 2 is preceded by Ephesians 5:21: \u201cSubmit to one another out of reverence for Christ.\u201d\nHere Keller presents Paul\u2019s thesis that \u201call married partners need the work of the Holy Spirit in their lives.\u201d\u00a0\nWhy?\nBecause it is only through the work of the Spirit that we can fight against the main enemy of marriage: self-centeredness!\nAnd this is where Keller\u2019s attack on the new notion of marriage\u2014a union where two people can be as free as when single\u2014really comes to the surface.\nThat, he says, is simply impossible!\nWhen you decide on a career\u2014be it a career in medicine, in law, or in the arts\u2014the thing everybody asks you to do so that you can succeed is \n. You don\u2019t become a writer without making a few sacrifices and dedicating your free time to writing, do you? And you don\u2019t become a successful lawyer by simultaneously studying for a doctor\u2019s degree, right? Well, why should marriage be any different?\n\u201cWhether we are husband or wife,\u201d writes Keller, \u201cwe are not to live for ourselves but for the other.\u00a0 And that is the hardest, yet single most important function of being a husband or a wife in marriage.\u201d\nKeller says that in a union\u2014any kind of union\u2014you have three possibilities (and three possibilities only): you can serve with joy, you can make an offer to serve with resentment or coldness, or you can selfishly insist on your own way.\nOnly one of these choices leads to happiness and fulfillment in marriage, and we don\u2019t need to tell you which one.\nThree: The Essence of Marriage\nIn the third chapter of \n(which opens with Ephesians 5:31), Keller gets the reader \u201cinto the heart of what marriage is all about\u2014namely, \n.\u201d\nOf course, the question he tries to give an answer to here is one of the oldest ones in the book: what, in God\u2019s name, is love actually?\u00a0\nContrary to what you think, love is not just another name for the butterflies in your stomach when you meet the one you think is \n one.\n\u201cWhen you first fall in love,\u201d reminds us Keller, \u201cyou think you love the person, but you don\u2019t really. You can\u2019t know who the person is right away. That takes years. You actually love your \n of the person\u2014and that is always, at first, one-dimensional and somewhat mistaken.\u201d\nThe real love comes after this, when you actually get to meet the person you\u2019ve fallen in love with. In fact, argues Keller, love is almost never what happens in the present: it is what gives validity to the promises for the future.\nHe writes:\nTrue love is not just horizontal\u2014it is vertical as well. When a covenant is made before God, God is also a part of the marriage. And when He is there, every broken promise is paid doubly.\nFour: The Mission of Marriage\nNow, you might ask, why would one need a \u201chorizontal\u201d relationship to somebody from the opposite sex if he can connect on a \u201cvertical\u201d level, and bask joyfully in the eternal love of God?\nFirst of all, think of it (of course, only metaphorically if you\u2019re religious) as a sort of a design flaw: Adam lived in the Garden of Eden and had the privilege of conversing with God Himself, and yet, he felt alone, and needed an Eve to be complete.\nEver since, every one of us feels pretty much the same. To paraphrase Black, \u201cwe need a friend, oh, we need a friend\u2014to make us happy, not stand here on our own\u2026\u201d Our spouse should, in (Christian) theory, be our best friend.\nAnd that means much more than you think. Namely, it doesn\u2019t merely mean having someone around you to understand you, but also having someone able to \u201csee your flaws, imperfections, weaknesses, dependencies\u201d and yet see beneath them the person you can become, \u201cthe person God wants you to be.\u201d\nOnce again, love is not about the present you: it is about the future us. And that\u2019s the mission of marriage: transforming you into someone you can be, someone you would have never become in the absence of the Other.\nFive: Loving the Stranger\nChapter five carries on with this discussion, exploring further the relationship between the present and the future in marriage, between knowledge and love.\nAnd it starts with a telling quote from American theologian Stanley Hauerwas who argued in \u201cSex and Politics: Bertrand Russell and \u2018Human Sexuality\u2019\u201d\u00a0that the primary problem in marriage is \u201clearning how to love and care for the stranger to whom you find yourself married.\u201d\nNo matter how long you\u2019ve dated somebody before, marrying him/her means marrying a stranger\u2014because marriage brings out many traits in both you and your partner that, up to that moment, were hidden from everybody.\nAnd now the real fight begins!\nAnd, interestingly enough, it is a twofold fight: you\u2019re not only confronted with the real person that is your spouse, but also with the real person that you yourself are.\nBut, that\u2019s why you have each other: to see in one another the \u201cbetter person\u201d that each of you can become and to help each other on the way.\nThat\u2019s why, writes Keller, \u201cone of the most basic skills in marriage is the ability to tell the straight, unvarnished truth about what your spouse has done\u2014and then, completely, unself-righteously, and joyously express forgiveness without a shred of superiority, without making the other person feel small.\u201d\nSix: Embracing the Other\nChapter 6 is written entirely by Timothy\u2019s wife, Kathy Keller; understandably, since it addresses one of the most controversial issues in Christian marriage, formulated by St. Paul in Ephesians 5:22-3, thus: \u201cWives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.\u201d\nKathy combines these verses with Ephesians 5:25 (\u201cHusbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her\u201d) to speak about a pretty controversial topic nowadays: gender differences.\nUnsurprisingly, she says that there are quite a few, and that these naturally result in two different functions: that of the husband, and that of the wife. It was always God\u2019s plan to make males and females different. And it was always a part of our duties to live in tune with our designs.\nAs far as women are concerned, this means voluntary submission, i.e., \u201ca gift offered\u2026 not a duty coerced.\u201d Marriage is all about embracing Otherness, which is why homosexual marriages inhibit growth, as opposed to heterosexual ones.\n\u201cA person of one\u2019s own sex is not as likely to have as much Otherness to embrace,\u201d writes Kathy, \u201cBut God\u2019s plan for married couples involves embracing the otherness to make us unified, and that can only happen between a man and a woman.\u201d\nSeven: Singleness and Marriage\nOK, if the above is true as far as homosexuals are concerned, what does that say about single people? They have even less Otherness to embrace. And if the mission of marriage is to make one \nthan he/she already is, does that mean that single people are, by default, not as fulfilled as married people?\nTo tell you the truth, we don\u2019t think the Kellers address this question properly.\u00a0\nThey say that, nowadays, when so many people put so much burden on marriage, and have so many expectations from it, singleness results in depression and despair. They \nfeel unfulfilled and unsatisfied, and even envious of other people\u2019s happiness.\nIf you are a Christian, however, that doesn\u2019t happen, since you already have \u201ca deeply fulfilling love relationship with Christ now, and hope in a perfect love relationship with him in the future.\u201d This may inspire you to find a spouse, but it can also help you live a fairly fulfilled life without one.\nOf course, if that is so, then marriage has little meaning; and if it is not, then you cannot live on Christ\u2019s love alone (see the summary of chapter 4 for more).\nEight: Sex and Marriage\n\u201cFor this reason,\u201d says St. Paul in Ephesians 5:31, \u201ca man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.\u201d\u00a0\nThis act of \u201cbecoming one flesh,\u201d however, has rarely been considered as something holy. In fact, quite the contrary: sex was a \u201cdirty deed\u201d in the eyes of many Christian theologians and thinkers, which is why it was also seen as unholy by many governments throughout history.\nKeller says that this is not supported by the Bible and that \u201cBiblical Christianity may be the most body-positive religion in the world.\u201d\nEven more, he says, that \u201csex is perhaps the most powerful God-created way to help you give your entire self to another human being.\u00a0 Sex is God\u2019s appointed way for two people to reciprocally say to one another, \u2018I belong completely, permanently, and exclusively to you.\u2019\n\u201cYou must not use sex to say anything less,\u201d concludes Keller and makes his case for sex in marriage being the only acceptable form of sex:\nSex, for Keller, is both a uniting act and a covenant renewal service; and it is just as important as love. In fact, it should be understood in much the same manner: it is not something you \n, but something you \n.\nTo one and one person only.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Meaning of Marriage\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You Will Never Find a Perfect Partner\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Knowledge Without Love Is Dreadful; Love Without Knowledge Is Superficial\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Marriage Is About Serving the Other (and Serving God)\nYou Will Never Find a Perfect Partner\nNo matter how much you try, you\u2019ll never find such a thing as a \u201csoul mate,\u201d i.e., \u201ca perfectly compatible match.\u201d\u00a0\nForget Disney and Hollywood: \u201chappily married ever after\u201d is a thing of fancy.\nMarriage is much harder than you think; but, also, much more rewarding.\nKnowledge Without Love Is Dreadful; Love Without Knowledge Is Superficial\nSo, finding someone perfectly compatible was never the point of marriage.\u00a0\nBecause, in that case, growth is inhibited. And marriage is all about growth, all about finding someone who\u2019ll love you \n for the way you are at the moment, but for what you can become in the future.\nIn fact, marriage is, almost always, a union between two strangers. We fall in love with the idea of a person, and that is not love\u2014it\u2019s just a superficial, physiologically explainable feeling. Only after really understanding someone you know your true feelings for him/her.\nThat\u2019s why, when you love somebody even after finding out most of his/her traits, you can be absolutely sure that you actually love him/her.\nMarriage Is About Serving the Other\u00a0\nMarriage, writes Keller, \u201cis a way for two spiritual friends to help each other on their journey to become the persons God designed them to be.\u201d\nIn other words, marriage means becoming \nthan you are with the help of someone else. To allow this process, you need to surrender yourself to that someone else.\nAnd by surrendering, we do mean \u201csurrendering\u201d: marriage is not the place to look for freedom. Quite the opposite, it is the place where you find the \n boundaries.\nJust like religion.\nWhich is why a Christian marriage (if we believe the Kellers) beats non-Christian marriages: once you learn to be submissive to Christ, it\u2019s easier to learn to surrender to a fellow human being.\nAfter all, \n?\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Meaning of Marriage Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nUnlike many too one-sided Christian books on the subject, \n has a lot to offer and is quite rich with both insights and wisdom that should certainly help its readers, be they single or married.\nHowever, we found it difficult to take much of it seriously since it\u2019s often self-contradicting, and it almost never takes into consideration what should marriage mean for those that are \n Christians.\nSo, if you are a Christian, this book justifies the title and will teach you a lot, not only about the meaning of marriage but also about the meaning of life. However, if you are not, you\u2019ll probably find almost nothing of value on most of its pages."},

And Why?\nWhen \nmagazine included Taylor in its annual list of most influential people, it said that she \u201cwrites spiritual nonfiction that rivals the poetic power of C.S. Lewis and Frederick Buechner,\u201d and that \u201cfew souls are as synced to the world\u2019s mysteries as Barbara Brown Taylor\u2019s.\u201d\nIf your life has been nothing but a long, desperate search for God, if you enjoy \n, if you truly want to understand other religions\u2014then \n is \n book for you.\nAbout Barbara Brown Taylor\n is an American Episcopal priest and a professor of Religion and Philosophy at Piedmont College; she is one of US\u2019 best preachers.\nShe has authored 14 books, some of which\u2014such as \n and \nare already considered classics, in addition to being \nbestsellers at the time of their first publication.\nIn 2014, \n magazine included Taylor in its annual list of the most influential people of the world.\nFind out more at \n\u00a0\n\u201cHoly Envy PDF Summary\u201d\nIn the Gospel of Matthew (22:35-40), as is\u2014or, at least, should be\u2014known to every Christian, upon hearing him talk, a lawyer comes near Jesus and asks him a simple question: \u201cMaster, which is the great commandment in the law?\u201d\nJesus responds: \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments,\u201d Jesus concludes, \u201chang all the law and the prophets.\u201d\nMost Christian denominations agree: they consider these two commandments to \u201ccontain the whole law of God\u201d and to be the benchmarks of a proper Christian life on earth. After all, Jesus himself calls these the greatest commandments. And it helps that they can be found, expressed in one way or another, in all the other three Gospels as well (Mark 12:28-31, Luke 10:25-28, John 13:31-35).\nHowever, in reality, it seems that things don\u2019t work that way: the more a Christian loves his god, the less he/she seems to love his/her neighbor.\nYou don\u2019t agree?\nReally?\nThink again: Muslims, Jews, Buddhists\u2014they are all your neighbors. How much do you actually love them? And how much are you merely interested in converting them, believing, deep down inside, that your path is the only reasonable path since it has been sanctioned by God and Jesus.\u00a0\nWell, Barbara Brown Taylor, an American Episcopal priest and Piedmont College professor of religion and philosophy, would want to kindly ask you to reconsider your position and leave room for something she refers to as \u201choly envy.\u201d\nInterested?\nWhat Is Holy Envy?\nTo understand what is \u201choly envy,\u201d we must go back a few decades and meet \u201ca tall, Scandinavian man with a stiff neck and a head of wavy hair\u201d named Krister Stendhal. A respected scholar of the apostle Paul, Stendhal was also the dean of Harvard Divinity School and the Bishop of Stockholm.\nJust a year after he was elected for the position, he faced a serious problem: vocal opposition from numerous people (mostly Christians) to the building of a new Mormon temple in Stockholm.\nNot a very Christian thing to do, don\u2019t you think?\nSo, at a press conference prior to the dedication of the temple, Stendhal proposed three rules of religious understanding that, in the words of Barbara Brown Taylor, \u201chave by now made the rounds more often than any of his scholarly work on the apostle Paul.\u201d\nThe three rules in question are the following ones:\n#1. When trying to understand another religion, you should ask the adherents of that religion and not its enemies;\n#2. Don\u2019t compare your best to their worst;\n#3. Leave room for holy envy.\nNobody really knows what Stendhal meant by #3, informs us Taylor, but you can guess the meaning of this rule by some of his subsequent actions. Namely, in one or two later discussions, he expressed his \u201choly envy\u201d for the best-known doctrine of the Latter-Day Saint movement: \u201cvicarious baptism\u201d or \u201cbaptism for the dead.\u201d\nIt was this \u201choly envy\u201d which gave Stendhal some \u201choly courage\u201d: though a Lutheran, he stood by the Mormons\u2014a religious minority in Sweden\u2014to the very end, fearless of how this may affect his status and position. \u201cIn the eyes of God, we are all minorities,\u201d he told a reporter shortly before his death in 2008.\n\u201cPlain Old Envy\u201d vs. \u201cHoly Envy\u201d\n\u201cThe first time I heard the phrase \u2018holy envy,\u2019\u201d writes Taylor after relaying the story above, \u201cI knew it was an improvement over the plain old envy I felt while studying other faiths.\u201d\u00a0\nWhat does she mean by that?\nWell, with \u201choly envy,\u201d it is a bit different. Because it is not anymore about what your religion\n\u2014but about what God surely \n. Since God is benevolent and the embodiment of all good things that have ever existed, it is only natural to expect that he is also everything other religions have (and is \n), and yours lacks (which is bad in itself).\nBut this leads us to another versus-section which should make things as clear as day.\nReligion vs. God\nTo understand \u201choly envy,\u201d you first need to understand that there is a difference between Christianity and Jesus\u2014or, in more general terms, between religion and God.\u00a0\nA simple analogy may help you to see this difference.\u00a0\nThink of a well filled with so much water inside that many people can dip buckets in it and take with them as much water as they like. Still, you\u2019d have to agree that neither the well nor the buckets are actually the water.\u00a0\nBecause no matter how much water there is in the well, there are also rivers and seas and oceans, and rain and snow and ice. None of them are the water; they are all just different aspects of it. The bucket, the well, the oceans\u2014they are all just containers; none of them is the source.\nThe same applies to this Christianity/Jesus or, more generally, religion/God relationship: Jesus and God are so much more than their containers, even if they are called the New Testament or the Bible. \u201cThe problem with every sacred text,\u201d writes Taylor, \u201cis that it has human readers. Consciously or unconsciously, we interpret it to meet our own needs.\u201d\u00a0\nOf course, there\u2019s nothing wrong with this if we admit it. The problems arise when we deny it. And, more often than not, we do precisely that! We don\u2019t think that we\u2019re interpreting the Bible, but that we\u2019re merely reporting what it \n says.\nThis is wrong on at least three accounts:\n#1. Unless you know both Hebrew and Greek and have a relevant error-free copy of the Bible, you\u2019re reading a translation, brought to you by certain translators, i.e., other human beings prone to making mistakes;\n#2. Claiming that you are merely reporting and not interpreting means that the language you understand (be it English or French or Portuguese) is so perfect that it can relay God\u2019s messages as they are.\n#3. Moreover, it means that you are able to understand God\u2019s words as perfectly clear as He does.\n\u201cIt is such a short distance between believing you possess an error-free message from God and believing that you are an error-free messenger of God,\u201d writes Taylor. And we don\u2019t need to tell you that the ones who believe to be error-free messengers of God are the very ones who are ready to commit crimes in His Name.\u00a0\nTaylor concludes:\nLearning from Other Religions\nTo put it simply, all religions are mere buckets which we lower under ground to take some living water so that we can start investigating and understanding it. God, however, is the entirety of the living water and cannot be understood completely. The ones who say they understand Him are just as sinful as Lucifer: too proud to know their own limitations.\nIf our religion is merely the lens through which we see God, it is very wrong to forbid other people to use their own lenses when they are doing pretty much the same thing. \u201cThe lens is not the landscape,\u201d writes Taylor. \u201cIt is a way of translating the landscape so that people can walk upright on it, making some sense of what happens to them.\u201d\nIt is not strange that different religions have made sense of God and the world in different manners; it is strange to think that your way is the only valid one.\u00a0\nThink of the story of Rabia of Basra, an eighth-century Sufi who was seen running one day through the streets of her native city, with a bucket of water in one hand and a torch in the other. When asked about it, Rabia replied that she wanted to put out the fires of hell with the water and burn down the reward of paradise with the torch.\n\u201cO, Allah,\u201d she prayed, \u201cif I worship You for fear of Hell, burn me in Hell, and if I worship You in the hope of Paradise, exclude me from Paradise. But if I worship You for Your Own sake, grudge me not Your everlasting Beauty.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s wrong with that story? asks Taylor. Isn\u2019t it a great illustration of unconditional love for God? So, what if its protagonist is a Muslim mystic from Iraq! Everyone who loves God can learn more about how to unconditionally surrender to himself via this story.\nThroughout \n, Taylor recounts many stories of this kind which have helped her broaden her perspectives. Perhaps the most memorable one happened to her at the end of a field trip to the Atlanta Masjid of Al-Islam, when the imam ended his meeting with these words of wisdom: \u201cOur deepest desire is not that you become Muslim, but that you become the best Christian, the best Jew, the best person you can be. In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Thank you for coming.\u201d\u00a0\nNow there\u2019s something to be envious about\u2014in a strictly holy kind of way.\nJesus and the Religious Strangers in \nLife\nJesus\u2019 two great commandments make a lot of sense even if you have just a vague understanding of his philosophy. For one, he didn\u2019t just help people who were like him\u2014he helped everyone. And, interestingly enough, he was also \n by these strangers.\nJust think of that Canaanite woman in Matthew 15:21-28. Jesus told her that he was \u201csent only to the lost sheep of Israel,\u201d but on account of her faith, he \u201cexpanded his sense of agency\u201d and granted her request to exorcise her daughter.\nOr think of that Roman centurion (Matthew 8:5-13), about whom Jesus himself says that he had \u201cnot found anyone in Israel with such great faith.\u201d And he was a pagan. What should these words mean if not embracing religious pluralism?\nFinally, think of the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-29), or, even more, of that other Samaritan (Luke 17:11-19), the only one of the ten lepers who returned to show his gratitude to Jesus after being cured by Him, even though a foreigner.\n\u201cNo preacher has suggested to the students of today that today\u2019s Good Samaritan might be a Good Muslim or a Good Humanist,\u201d writes Taylor. \u201cNo confirmation class teacher has taught them that the Golden Rule includes honoring the neighbor\u2019s religion as they would have the neighbor honor theirs.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cHoly Envy\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Stendhal\u2019s Three Rules of Religious Understanding\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If Proper, Religious Envy Can Make You Holier\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Bible Is Not God, and You Are Not the Bible\nStendhal\u2019s Three Rules of Religious Understanding\nAccording to Swedish theologian and scholar Krister Stendhal, if you really want to be a good person, you need to accept and understand other religions. And if you want to do that, you need to follow three rules:\n#1. Learn about this other religion from its devotees, and not its enemies;\n#2. Don\u2019t compare your best to their worst; and\n#3. Practice holy envy.\nIf Proper, Religious Envy Can Make You Holier\nEven though nobody knows what precisely Stendhal means by \u201cpractice holy envy,\u201d Barbara Brown Taylor has a pretty good idea.\nIt means that some practices in other religious traditions may be better than the ones in your own, and you should be willing to recognize this fact, not merely as an aspect of faith, but also as an aspect of the All-Good God.\nWhat\u2019s wrong with the Muslims praying five times a day no matter what? Or with Buddhist meditation? Or with Judaism not embracing the doctrine of the original sin?\nIt\u2019s good to envy these things; because this envy may help you understand that these other religious traditions, just like yours, are ways to come close to God. Something which we share\u2014and not something which should divide us.\nThe Bible Is Not God, and You Are Not the Bible\nThe reason why religious people don\u2019t seem to understand each other is because all of them think that their book (and not the book of their neighbors) represents the Word of God. Maybe all of them are right, says Taylor.\nThe problem is that the language of these books is a human language, and human languages are prone to create misunderstandings. What we read in the Bible is not God\u2019s words, but an interpretation of them. And, consequently, what we know about God is not God, but merely an aspect of His.\nOnly by embracing pluralism, we should be able to understand Him better.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cHoly Envy Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nNormally, we tend to be a bit skeptical as far as religious books are concerned. Even the best of them\u2014such as, say, \n\u2014forget that there are millions of people out there who can\u2019t relate to a particular frame of reference and are, thus, left out from the start.\ndoesn\u2019t forget anything\u2014nor it leaves out someone. Understanding, warm, compassionate, biographical, informed, it is one of the best religious books we\u2019ve ever read.\u00a0\nBrown Taylor truly is a treasure, and this might be her most important book yet."},

It is determined by genetics.\u00a0\nHence, the claims that some exercises create \u201clong, lean\u201d muscles, while others result in \u201cbulky, ugly\u201d muscles is a myth, unsupported by any known science.\nWhether you do yoga or weight training, the shape of your muscles will remain the same, and the only thing that will change is their growth: weight training, of course, grows muscles faster than yoga, which, in turn, makes them more flexible.\nAll in all, you can have sexy arms and shapely legs\u2014only not the very ones of your favorite model.\nThis myth is already addressed in #1, but Matthews is so irritated by it that he feels the need to repeat it.\u00a0\n\u201c\n,\u201d he writes, \u201c\n. Your body simply can\u2019t do it. It lacks the hormones and genetic programming.\u201d\nExercising too long on a daily basis leads to overtraining which, in turn, makes you lethargic and gives your body too little time to repair your muscles. Consequently, this can sometimes cause you to \n muscles and \nfat.\nThe optimal time: 45 to 60 minutes of workout per day.\nWhen your muscles are burning, what you\u2019re actually feeling is lactic acid building up in your muscles, and that may be not as bad as it sounds, but it is not good either.\nNot to go into detail, it certainly means that you\u2019re doing yourself more harm than good.\n\u201cNo pain, no gain\u201d?\n\u201cOne of the worst fallacies out there,\u201d according to Matthews.\nIf you\u2019re going to the gym to improve your muscle tone and get stronger, then you need to know that this requires three simple things: \u201clift progressively heavier weights, eat correctly, and give your body sufficient rest.\u201d\nThe most effective muscle-building exercises are known as \u201ccompound exercises\u201d (because they involve multiple muscle groups) and include the Squat, Deadlift, and Bench Press.\n\u201cIsolation exercises\u201d such as the Cable Fly, Dumbbell Curl, and Leg Extension (which involve one muscle group only) are little short of wasting your time.\nUnfortunately, most people don\u2019t have a clue as to the proper form of exercises, and this doesn\u2019t merely hold back their progress, but it also opens the door to debilitating injuries since it causes unnecessary wear and tear on ligaments, tendons, and joints.\nDon\u2019t be that idiot: exercise only what science says is helpful and beneficial.\nOK, this is the other end of the spectrum: training without pushing yourself forward. That will, of course, never work.\nEven though evolution works against you when it comes to your perfect body\u2014everyone avoids discomfort in favor of pleasure and ease\u2014if you\u2019ve decided to go to the gym, then you need to put in the effort.\nEspecially when it\u2019s difficult to do so.\nAs we said above, exercising is merely one part of the equation; the other is nutrition. And even the women who know this are way, way off when it comes to eating properly.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t eat enough calories and get enough protein, carbs, and fats throughout the day,\u201d writes Matthews, \u201cyour muscles simply don\u2019t grow bigger or stronger. It doesn\u2019t matter how hard you train; if you don\u2019t eat enough, you won\u2019t gain any muscle to speak of.\u201d\nThe opposite is also true: \u201cif you eat too many calories, eat bad carbs and fats, and don\u2019t know how to proportion and plan your meals properly, you can gain muscle, but it will be hidden underneath an ugly sheath of unnecessary fat.\u201d\nThe Real Science of Muscle Growth\nCongratulations: you\u2019ve just learned how to do it wrong! Now, it\u2019s time for the more important part: how do you correctly go about building your muscles?\nBy never forgetting and always adhering to the four laws below, because, as Matthews says, they are \u201cas certain, observable, and irrefutable as those of physics.\u201d\nThe first law of muscle growth is one that needs explaining rather than merely stating. In other words, everybody knows that muscles grow only if they are forced to, but very few people know why.\nMatthews explains.\nIt\u2019s rather simple, really.\nBy lifting weights, you\u2019re actually causing tiny tears (i.e., \u201cmicro-tears\u201d) in the muscle fibers, which then your body repairs so that it is better prepared to handle the stimulus which caused the damage in the first place.\nConsequently, if you\u2019re not producing \u201cmicro-tears\u201d in your muscles, your muscles won\u2019t grow since they\u2019d deem themselves adapted to your current needs.\u00a0\nBut, just as important, if you\u2019re producing too many \u201cmicro-tears\u201d in your muscles, then your body won\u2019t be able to repair them, and this will hinder your muscle growth as well.\n\u201cFor optimal muscle growth,\u201d concludes Matthews, \u201cyou must train in such a way that causes optimal micro-tearing and then you must feed your body what it needs to grow and give it the proper amount of rest.\u201d\nAs we said above, the feeling of \u201cburning\u201d in your muscles is not synonymous with muscle growth; it\u2019s actually just fatigue in the form of too much lactic acid.\u00a0\nConsequently, the burning sensation is not an indicator of optimum workout\u2014it\u2019s oftentimes quite the opposite.\nThe same holds true for the pump you feel when training. It is merely the result of blood being \u201cenclosed\u201d in the muscles, and, while not bad, it\u2019s also not the primary driver of growth.\nWhat is, then?\n.\nOverload always gives muscles a very clear reason to grow, which means that plain old heavy weightlifting is the best workout for muscle growth known to man.\nAnd, contrary to what many trainers and magazines say, you don\u2019t need to change your routine every week or two: you can do the above every day, and the results will inevitably show.\nIf you understood well the first law of muscle growth, you already know that muscles actually grow \nthe gym.\u00a0\nInside it, you\u2019re merely creating the \u201cmicro-tears\u201d which your body needs to repair while you\u2019re resting afterward; it is this \u201crepair\u201d the thing we term as \u201cmuscle growth.\u201d\nConsequently, working out too much doesn\u2019t do you any good. Sleeping eight hours a day after exercising for no more than one \nEven if you do the perfect workout and give your muscles the optimum amount of rest time, if you don\u2019t eat correctly, your muscles won\u2019t grow bigger or stronger\u2014period.\n\u201cSimply put,\u201d writes Matthews, \u201cyour diet determines about 70 \u2013 80% of how you look (muscular or scrawny, lean or flabby).\u201d\nPrecisely because of this, instead of summing up the main points of the book, we\u2019ve opted to share with you a few more nutrition-related insights from \nin our \u201cKey Lessons\u201d section.\nWe know you won\u2019t mind.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThinner Leaner Stronger\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The 5 Biggest Fat Loss Myths & Mistakes\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Real Science of Healthy Fat Loss\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Setting Fitness Goals to Motivate Yourself\nThe 5 Biggest Fat Loss Myths & Mistakes\nJust as there are muscle building myths and mistakes, there are myths and mistakes related to burning fat as well. Matthews dispels five of them:\nOf\ncourse it\u2019s pretty essential to count your calories if you want to get fit! If you want to lose fat, your body must burn more energy than it receives through your food, and the energy potential of food is measured in calories. Consequently, eating more calories than you can burn through the day results in more fat. It\u2019s that simple.\nNot if you\u2019re eating too many calories! Cardio enhances fat loss, but only to a certain point. If you eat 600 calories more than you need, jogging will burn only half of that, and you\u2019ll still gain fat at the end.\nThe Atkins diet. The paleo diet. \n. \n\u2026 Well, how many diets are there? you wonder. Well, the truth is, there are only a few rules (see next lesson), and everything else is just a fad which makes some people serious money.\nBeing lean is not a matter of exercising: it is a matter of having low body fat. And it\u2019s something you certainly won\u2019t achieve with a routine based on low weight and high reps.\nFat can be reduced only via proper dieting, and not via isolated exercises targeted at spot reduction. And when it is reduced, your body will decide in what way. \u201cOur bodies are all genetically programmed differently, and there\u2019s nothing we can do to change that,\u201d says Matthews.\nThe Real Science of Healthy Fat Loss\nNow that you know the myths\u2014it\u2019s time you get to know the three fundamental laws of fat loss:\nGetting toned has nothing to do with fads and magazine advice, and it has everything to do with simple biology and even simpler math: energy consumed versus energy expended.\nUnless your metabolism is very fast, every calorie you give to your body that isn\u2019t burned off turns to fat. If you give your body fewer calories than it can burn throughout the day, than it makes up for the deficit by burning its own energy stores, i.e., fat.\nThe bottom line: it doesn\u2019t matter what you eat, as long as your calories are right.\nAs we just said, fat loss is much more related to \nyou eat than it is to \nyou eat.\u00a0\nSince different people have different metabolisms, there isn\u2019t one definite science-backed recommendation to take note of when it comes to your meal schedule.\nJust adhere to the one which seems to work best for you based on your experience.\nEven though cardio doesn\u2019t equal burning fat, it does accelerate fat loss, and if your genetics isn\u2019t on your side (fast calorie-regulating metabolism), it\u2019s a nice way to get into the \u201csuper lean\u201d category (15% body fat and under).\nSetting Fitness Goals to Motivate Yourself\n\u201cThis is so simple and clich\u00e9d that you\u2019d think it wouldn\u2019t need stating, but it does,\u201d says Michael Matthews before stating the obvious: \u201cBefore you lift a weight, hop on a treadmill, or cut a calorie, you must have specific, tangible goals set in your mind as to why you\u2019re doing it.\u201d\nSetting them is as easy as 1-2-3:\n#1. Determine what your ideal body should look like; don\u2019t just throw around adjectives: find a picture; after all, you don\u2019t go to the barbershop without one, do you?\n#2. Determine your ideal state of health. Matthews\u2019 is along these lines: \u201co have a vital, energetic, strong, and disease-free body that lives long and allows me to stay active and enjoy my life to the fullest.\u201d That\u2019s motivating, isn\u2019t it?\n#3. Give yourself a reason to achieve these goals. Whether it\u2019s being better at some of your hobbies or getting more attention from your partner\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter. Just give yourself one that will motivate you along the road. Because, after all, it is a long one.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThinner Leaner Stronger Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nIf you want to lose fat and get the perfect body, what you need is a scientific method.\u00a0\nAnd, unlike many other books on the subject, \nquotes quite a few studies and is adamant in its conviction that the science behind getting fit is both simple and translatable into practical routines.\nWe went over its basics above; if you want to learn more about the specific routines, you\u2019ll need to do more than just look inside the book: you\u2019ll need to \n put Matthews\u2019 advice into practice.\nMany women say that this has worked for them.\nHopefully, it will work for you too."},

And Why?\nNicely written, Frank Bruni\u2019s book targets three different types of audience:\n\u2022 Prospective college students who want to get a degree from an Ivy League college;\n\u2022 Parents of prospective college students \u2013 and even kindergarten tykes \u2013 who think that only an Ivy League college guarantees success and a bright future for their children;\n\u2022 Everyone who cares about the state of the American educational system.\nIf you can see yourself belonging to one of these groups \u2013 both now and in the recent future \u2013 don\u2019t hesitate to pick up this book. It\u2019s important that you do.\nAbout Frank Bruni\nA Few Somewhat Ignored Lists That Matter a Lot\n\u201cThere\u2019s a widespread conviction, spoken and unspoken, that the road to riches is trimmed in Ivy and the reins of power held by those who\u2019ve donned Harvard\u2019s crimson, Yale\u2019s blue and Princeton\u2019s orange, not just on their chests but in their souls,\u201d writes Frank Bruni in the first chapter of \n.\nHowever, not much research is necessary for one to realize that nothing can be further from the truth. We know it sounds strange, but bear with us for two or three lists.\nLet\u2019s start with the Fortune 500 list of 2014, the last one to appear before Bruni\u2019s book was published (there are some changes since then as far as the bottom half is concerned, but they are irrelevant to Bruni\u2019s case).\nBack in 2014, the largest ten US corporations by total revenue were, in order, Wal-Mart, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Berkshire Hathaway, Apple, Phillips 66, General Motors, Ford Motor, General Electric, and Valero Energy.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s the list, in the same order of schools where these companies\u2019 CEOs have got their undergraduate degrees: the University of Arkansas; the University of Texas; the University of California, Davis; the University of Nebraska; Auburn; Texas A&M; the General Motors Institute (now called Kettering University); the University of Kansas; Dartmouth College and the University of Missouri\u2013St. Louis.\nYup, that\u2019s right: just one Ivy League school on that list!\nOK, you might say, but what about our presidents?\u00a0\nThe last five of them are all Ivy League graduates: Donald Trump got his degree from Penn, Barack Obama from Columbia (and Harvard), both Bushes got their degrees from Yale, and Clinton from Georgetown and then Yale Law.\nWiden the circle a bit, however, and you get the full \u2013 and much more important \u2013 story:\n\u2022 Ronald Reagan attended Eureka College, a tiny school in Illinois that, in 2014, was ranked only 31st among \u201cRegional Colleges (Midwest)\u201d on the infernal U.S. News & World Report survey.\n\u2022 Jimmy Carter moved around during his undergraduate and graduate years, landing not just at the U.S. Naval Academy but also at Georgia Southwestern College and Georgia Tech.\n\u2022 Richard Nixon got his bachelor\u2019s from Whittier College in Southern California. \n\u2022 Lyndon Baines Johnson got his from Southwest Texas State Teachers College.\nAnd the same holds true about many presidential nominees, whether Joe Biden, Paul Ryan or John Edwards. Who knows if it is actually a good idea to mention Dan Quayle\u2019s education \u2013 the guy couldn\u2019t spell \u201cpotato\u201d right \u2013 but he made it to the White House and \u201c\n a mere heartbeat away from the presidency\u2026 by way of DePauw University in Indiana and law school at Indiana University.\u201d\nThe Unsung Alma Maters\nThe point?\nWell, to paraphrase the title of Frank Bruni\u2019s words, the point is that the university you decide upon doesn\u2019t, in turn, decide upon your future:\nTo make the point even clearer, Bruni cites the so-called Platinum Study by sociologist D. Michael Lindsay published just a few months before his book.\nThe study involved interviews with over 500 American leaders, over half of which were CEOs of major corporations, and more than 100 of which were leaders of major non-profit groups. The leaders also included many government officials and even a few former presidents. The study, expectedly, aimed to discover where all these leaders \u201ccame from, how they reached their destinations and how they thought and behaved once they arrived.\u201d\n\u201cI fully expected that we would see that a large percentage of people had gone to highly selective schools both for secondary and higher education,\u201d Lindsay told Bruni.\u00a0\nHowever, as he wrote in his study-inspired book \n, \u201cwhile we often assume that the most direct path to national influence goes through major academic universities (such as Ivy League schools), nearly two-thirds of the leaders I interviewed attended schools that are not considered elite institutions.\u201d\nThrowing Darts: Everything That\u2019s Wrong with USA\u2019s Educational System\nDetermined to get into one of the dozen or so most selective institutions of higher learning in America? Rethink your determination\u2014or at least hear out Frank Bruni\u2019s opinion on that subject beforehand:\nOf course, the above is an exaggeration, but not by much.\u00a0\nAnd here\u2019s why.\nBack in 2015, only 5.1% of 42,167 received by Stanford got back an acceptance notice.\u00a0\nSo, that\u2019s just 1 in 20 aspirants. And bear in mind that the other 19 weren\u2019t \u201cslackers, stumblebums, unhinged gamblers or delusional narcissists\u201d\u2014but \u201caccomplished secondary school students for whom Stanford wasn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t have been a completely ludicrous wish.\u201d\nBut how attending an Ivy League College got to become such a \u201cludicrous wish\u201d?\nWell, quite simply, it was what the Ivy League Colleges \n to achieve. You see, scarcity (\n) is one of the six universal principles of human behavior, and, unfortunately, one of the main things taken into consideration before a college ranking is published.\nEven more unfortunately, scarcity can be manufactured, and this is precisely what Stanford, Yale, or Princeton are doing: they are simultaneously attracting more and more applicants and lowering the acceptance quotes.\nTo use the words of Ted O\u2019Neill, the dean of admissions at the University of Chicago for several decades until 2009 \u2013 a while ago, a surfeit of applications \u201cbecame a way to promote your college, and the admissions office became, in effect, a public-relations arm of the university.\u201d\nIf you think that factoring admission rates is the only thing that\u2019s wrong about college rankings, think again.\n\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d wrote Jeffrey Benzel in an article, a dean of admissions at Yale, soon after stepping from this job in 2013. \u201cThe publication of college rankings is a business enterprise that capitalizes on anxiety about college admissions.\u201d\nWhile choosing a college is indisputably more important than buying a household appliance, he went on, \u201ccollege rankings systems all take a far less thorough and scientific approach than Consumer Reports does when testing vacuum cleaners. Another problem with rankings is that they allow the dominant player\u2014\n, a magazine that has actually gone defunct and exists now only as a purveyor of rankings\u2014to exert undue influence.\u201d\nBelieve it or not, more than 20% of the score that \n assigns a school \u201creflects what high school guidance counselors think of it and the regard in which presidents, provosts and admissions deans at other colleges hold it.\u201d\nAnd how can anyone have in-depth knowledge about any school other than their own? In addition, how does \nmeasure a college\u2019s \u201creputation,\u201d another thing that gets calculated into the final ranking? And how does the money a university has relates to the quality of the education it offers?\nAnd yet, the very existence of rankings system makes students opt for the higher-rated universities, despite the fact that some of them may not be the best choice for them on a more important, \n level.\nBut the above two are certainly not the only obstacles. A third one is that some of the aspirants are children of previous Ivy League attendees \u2013 or are somehow connected to alumni of the institutions.\nThis is what\u2019s called legacy preference and is what allows some families and people \n.\u00a0\nDon\u2019t believe that?\nYou don\u2019t have to, because it is a well-known fact: according to a study done by Michael Hurwitz in 2011, legacies had a 23.3% better chance of admission than non-legacies. Even worse, \u201cprimary legacies\u201d had a 45.1 percent better chance.\nIn other words, between two identical candidates, if a non-legacy has a 30% chance of getting into a certain university, a primary legacy will have about 80% chance, i.e., will almost certainly get an acceptance notice.\nIs that\u2026 fair?\nSpeaking of fairness\u2014is it fair that these legacy families are usually very rich, to begin with?\nOnce again, you don\u2019t have to take Bruni\u2019s word for it: according to a study conducted by former Yale alumni, Rebecca Fabbro, 48% percent of Yale\u2019s students (yes, that\u2019s half of them) are coming from families who make more than $200,000 per year, i.e., are in the top 5% in the USA.\nIn other words, it\u2019s a self-perpetuating and very vicious circle: the rich gain acceptance at Ivy League colleges because of their connections, and their children because of their legacies.\nObsessive Parents and As Obsessive Children\nHowever, because even poor parents know that getting into an Ivy School College is a one-way ticket to success, they are willing to do anything to get their children any type of advantage.\nOf course, in a market-based society, that amounts to the establishment of numerous institutions that are willing to help them \u2013 and earn quite a lot of money in return.\nYou need nothing more but a single piece of information to realize how crazy things are: because getting the head start has become an obsession for parents, there are organizations (in \n!) which offer \u201cguidance and test preparation for kids vying for admission to selective grammar schools, kindergartens, and even preschools.\u201d\nOne of them, the Aristotle Circle (founded by a former investment banker who had done her undergraduate work at MIT before getting an MBA at Columbia), receives $450 for every hour of tutoring.\nNo wonder that Michael Motto, a former admissions officer at Yale, once received an application from a highly impressive young woman, who thought it was smart to mention, in her application essay, that she once preferred to urinate on herself so as to not pull herself away from an intellectually stimulating discussion with her French teacher!\nThat\u2019s not something one should admire, Motto notes. It\u2019s something that needs to be properly treated.\nJust like the entire US educational system.\nKey Lessons from \u201cWhere You Go Is Not Who You\u2019ll Be\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The American Educational System Is Deeply Flawed and Biased\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Your University Doesn\u2019t Define You: It\u2019s What You Do There That Does\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Widen Your Horizons: Choose a College That Doesn\u2019t Suit You\n(but Sparks Your Curiosity)\nThe American Educational System Is Deeply Flawed and Biased\nEvery year the \npublishes a highly influential Best Colleges ranking. And every year prospective students eagerly await its publication so that it can help them in their decision which college to attend.\nHowever, due to the rankings system being highly unscientific and subjective, and due to the fact that the admission process is demonstrably biased toward the rich, the white and the legacies, many students end up not only rejected but also depressed and directionless.\nThe point of an educational system, of course, is the very opposite.\nYour University Doesn\u2019t Define You: It\u2019s What You Do There That Does\nOn the bright side, the CEOs of most Fortune 500 companies, many politicians and vice presidents, numerous Nobel Prize winners, and creative geniuses have never attended an Ivy League College. In other words, all of them have succeeded despite joining minor and relatively unimportant universities.\nThis shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone because numerous studies have revealed that much more important than the university you choose is the way you spend your time there. Being deeply and actively involved in campus activity or group, for example, has been shown most decisively to be a significant factor in one\u2019s happiness later in life.\nSo, don\u2019t just dabble around in activities trying to fill out your resume. Join smartly. Connect. Experience being a part of something. \n.\nWiden Your Horizons: Choose a College That Doesn\u2019t Suit You (but Sparks Your Curiosity)\nSpeaking of happiness \u2013 the more diverse a university is, the more likely it should result in one\u2019s contentment. College should be all about leaving your comfort zone and \n: elite schools, usually, achieve quite the opposite.\n\u201cCollege,\u201d writes Bruni, \u201cis a singular opportunity to rummage through and luxuriate in ideas, to give your brain a vigorous workout and your soul a thorough investigation, to realize how very large the world is and to contemplate your desired place in it.\u201d\nOne more thing while we\u2019re here.\u00a0\nBelieve it or not, according to a nationwide Gallup poll, only 9% of business leaders deem the ranking of your college a \u201cvery important\u201d employment factor. 85%, on the other hand, think your field-relevant knowledge is the most important employment criterion.\nDo you still think that not getting into an Ivy League College spells the end of your life?\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cWhere You Go Is Not Who You\u2019ll Be Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nis more than just a good book \u2013 it is also a \n book.

Maxwell, we\u2019re living through a paradigm shift, one that has redefined the very meaning of the word \u201cleadership.\u201d So we might as well change the word:\n.\u00a0\nWho Should Read \u201cLeadershift\u201d? And Why?\nThere are not many leadership authors that write as clearly and as vividly as John C. Maxwell.\u00a0\nSo, even though he is not the first to talk about leadershifting (just recently, we summarized one of the pioneering books on the subject of \n, \n), we guess that this is the book that will become the classical introduction to the topic.\nSuitable for both experienced and would-be leaders, we recommend \nwarmly and wholeheartedly to anyone who wants to understand how leaders ought to think about in the most dynamic age in history.\nAbout John C. Maxwell\n is, \n, the foremost authority on leadership in the world.\u00a0\nThe founder of EQUIP\u2014an international leadership development organization working to help leaders\u2014and the eponymous John Maxwell Company\u2014that helps companies and teams thrive with \u201c\n\u201d based training\u2014he is also a revered teaching pastor at Christ Fellowship in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, and a recurrent guest pastor at the famous Crystal Cathedral in Orange County, California.\nHe has written over 40 books that have jointly sold about 20 million copies and have been translated into more than 50 languages. We have summarized about half of them, including \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n.\nFind out more at \n.\u00a0\n\u201cLeadershift PDF Summary\u201d\n\u201cYou cannot be the same, think the same and act the same if you hope to be successful in a world that does not remain the same,\u201d writes \n early in \n, clearly outlining the main premise of his book.\nIn the 1970s, when he was young and new to his career, as he says, there were very few books on leadership, because \u201c\nruled the business world and Peter Drucker was the king.\u201d But toward the 1980s that changed and people started to write and buy leadership books. For a very obvious reason: life started moving faster, change was becoming normal, and managers needed to find a more flexible way to organize their companies.\n\u201cAs fast as the pace was in the 1980s,\u201d goes on Maxwell, \u201cwhen I look back it seems slow by today\u2019s standards. Life moves \nfaster now. The rate at which we must deal with change and uncertainty can seem insane.\u201d\nThe problem is that leaders, by the very definition of their role, have to stay ahead and see \n than everyone else\u2014way before everyone else can see it. The second guy to finish a race is, as they say, the first loser and, even though in sports the achievements of the two guys behind the leader are also recognized, in business (as in life), it is the winner that takes it all.\nIn addition to moving faster, life is also constantly evolving, making the race far less predictable. Or as Maxwell says, nowadays, \n is shorter. You see, up until 30 years ago, a short-range plan of two years, a medium-range plan of five years, and a long-range plan of ten years were the hallmarks of leading a successful organization. Now, even long-range plans of two years seem absurd!\nIn short, business was once a marathon and, in a marathon, managing your strength and pace while being consistent in your tempo is what eventually gets you the victory. It\u2019s a long race and you can be sure that the finish line won\u2019t move for a long period of time. Today, however, business is a relentless series of sprints, and in sprints, you need to be incredibly fast and agile and flexible\u2014like a cheetah.\nHow does a leader do more than just hang on and survive in this kind of an ever-changing, fast-moving environment? \u201cThe key,\u201d says Maxwell, \u201cis to learn how to continually make \n.\u201d Needless to say, that\u2019s what \n is all about.\nThe Top 3 Leadership Qualities of the Future (and the Essence of Leadershifting)\nIn one of her books, educator and author Bruna Martinuzzi cited a recent study conducted by an organization called the Economic Intelligence Unit. The study, via a survey, identified the top three leadership qualities that will be important in the years ahead:\n\u2022 the ability to motivate staff (35%)\n\u2022 the ability to work well across cultures (34%)\n\u2022 the ability to facilitate change (32%)\nAll of these qualities require adaptability, an ability which, in Maxwell\u2019s opinion, has rarely been more important in history than it is today.\u00a0\nHis opinion can be confirmed not only by common sense but also by a study conducted by Right Management and published recently in \n that made it clear that adaptability is all the rage nowadays. In numbers, the study uncovered that \u201c91% of future recruiting in the workplace will be based on people\u2019s ability to deal with change and uncertainty.\u201d Leaders are not exempt: on the contrary, in fact, they need to be even more adaptable than their employees.\nAnd that\u2019s what \n entails: it is not anymore about having a predefined course and being a captain of a ship (leadership), but about being able to (to paraphrase Bob Dylan) change your horses in midstream.\n\u201cGood leaders adapt,\u201d writes Maxwell. \u201cThey shift. They don\u2019t remain static because they know the world around them does not remain static. This has always been true, but it\u2019s never more obvious than today, nor has the ability to change quickly been more important.\u201d\nAs defined by John C. Maxwell, \u201cleadershifting is the ability and willingness to make a leadership change that will positively enhance organizational and personal growth.\u201d Or, even more concise, as defined in the blurb, leadershift is \u201cthe act of nimbly adapting one\u2019s leadership in the midst of rapid change.\u201d\u00a0\nThis can be achieved via 7 fundamental practices, 4 self-improvement techniques, and 11 essential changes.\nThe 7 Fundamental Leadershift Practices\nIf you want to become tomorrow\u2019s leader, you need to embrace 7 principles, seven leadershift practices that should help you face every possible situation with both confidence and flexibility:\n. \u201cThe lessons learned in school can become outdated before student loans are paid off,\u201d \nThe encyclopedias of the past were updated once every few years; today\u2019s encyclopedias are updated several times a minute. Update yourself: constantly.\n. \u201cYesterday\u2019s homerun doesn\u2019t win today\u2019s game,\u201d said once baseball\u2019s greatest Babe Ruth. The lesson: focus on current challenges, and leave the past glories to the past.\nAs\nWild West\u2019s gunslingers knew full well, it\u2019s not only about being fast but also about being fast at the right time. As then, timing is everything today as well.\nTry to\nlearn in layers. And never fool yourself that you\u2019ve learned everything there is to know about a subject. It\u2019s quite the opposite: the more you learn about something\u2014if you\u2019re learning correctly\u2014the \n there is to learn.\nEven though, as we said above (#2), you need to focus on today, leaders are leaders because they can think about tomorrow as well. Even if for much, much shorter periods than in the 1980s\u2014always, \n, plan ahead.\nBeing a leader is all about risking, about getting out of the comfort zone. It\u2019s not only true that when the going gets tough, the tough get going\u2014it\u2019s also true that the ones who risk bravely are the ones who win the biggest prizes.\nUpgrading, upgrading, upgrading. In a world of radical changes, that is your only way to remain a leader in the long run. Only the short-sighted rest on their laurels.\nThe 4 Questions You Need to Ask Yourself\nAs we said above, if you want to prepare yourself to become someone who \n\u2014rather than being someone who merely leads\u2014you need to improve constantly.\u00a0\nBy asking yourself the following four questions, you should be able to set signposts to guide you on your journey toward self-improvement, which, in essence, can be described in, more or less, a version of the famous Olympic motto: faster, higher, stronger:\n.\nAsk yourself,\u00a0\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time I learned something for the first time?\u201d\n.\nAsk yourself,\u00a0\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time I did something for the first time?\u201d\nAsk yourself,\u00a0\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time I found something better for the first time?\u201d\nAsk yourself,\u00a0\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time I saw something bigger for the first time?\u201d\nThe 11 Essential Changes Every Leader Must Embrace\nNow that we\u2019ve tucked the matter under the bed\u2014if you want to be a leader in the 21\n century, you need to change constantly\u2014it\u2019s time we go over the eleven essential changes every leader must embrace, i.e., the leadershifts from the title.\nThirty years ago, being a leader was all about being a soloist, being the one who can do everything on his own and doesn\u2019t need a backing orchestra. In the world of today, however, leadership is much more akin to being a conductor: the one who directs everyone in the right direction so that the symphony is harmonious. As \n wrote once, \u201cYou can get everything in life you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGoals helped me \n better,\u201d writes Maxwell, \u201cbut growth helped me \n better.\u201d Needless to add, in the 21\n century, you need to redeploy your attention and interest toward the latter: as important as goals are, growth should come before them. The four areas you need to focus the most are the following: attitude, leadership skills, developing strong relationships, and equipping others to carry on without you.\u00a0\n\u201cThere is no success without sacrifice,\u201d said once Adoniram Judson, the first Protestant missionary sent from North America to preach in Burma. \u201cIf you succeed without sacrifice, it is because someone has suffered before you. If you sacrifice without success, it is because someone will succeed after you.\u201d Great leaders prefer the leader: they don\u2019t become leaders because they want to get something, but because they know they can \n something. \u201cWhat sets great leaders apart from all other leaders is this,\u201d writes Maxwell. \u201cThey \n before others, and they \n more than others. Great leaders face their uncertainty and doubt, and they move through it to pave the way for others.\u201d\n\u201cThe leadership business\u201d is \n \u201cthe friendship business.\u201d If you want to lead other people, you need to do away with the need to be liked by them: leadership, by definition, means challenging others to go beyond their comfort zone, and people don\u2019t like to be uncomfortable. Think of it this way: if you lead them right, they might not like you today or tomorrow, but they\u2019ll love you in twenty years.\nWhether we want it or not, most of the time, we do things convention says we should do. After all, tradition is tested knowledge, and if it has worked for millions of times in the past, it should work today as well, right? Well, wrong: in a fast-changing world, maintaining best practices should be balanced with creating, and leaders should teach their employees to stop thinking in terms of \u201cI do what I have always done\u201d\u00a0and start accepting as a motto the \u201ccreative zone\u201d adage: \u201cI attempt to think what I have never thought before.\u201d\n\u201cHow high can I go?\u201d was the question of the ladder-climbers of the greedy 80s. Then, after that world crumbled to pieces, it evolved to something a bit more human as \u201cHow high will others go with a little help?\u201d These ladder-holders recently became ladder-extenders, and started positing themselves the question: \u201chow high will others go with a lot of help?\u201d We need to make the final step, suggests Maxwell, and become ladder-builders. The new question leaders should adapt as an objective is: \u201cCan I help \n build their own ladder?\u201d\n\u201cWhen you interact with others as a leader, what is your mindset?\u201d asks Maxwell. \u201cIs your intention to correct them or connect with them?\u201d If the former, then you are a dinosaur, one of all those Moses Juniors of the past who believed that leaders should be all about \u201cI know and order, you don\u2019t and listen.\u201d The leaders of tomorrow are the leaders who connect today: they are trustful and talkative, they listen, they ask questions, they have answers. Become one of them, \n.\nDiversity, according to Malcolm Forbes, is \u201cthe art of thinking independently together.\u201d And it is the hallmark of a great leader. Examples: during the American Civil War, Abraham Lincoln gathered around him \n, because he knew that \nhe would get the best advice; similarly, during the Second World War, Winston Churchill often debated with Clement Attlee, one of his fiercest political adversaries. Don\u2019t back away from dissent: embrace it.\n21\n century is the age of what Alexander Havard deems \n. Gone are the days when the mere position of leader granted one authority: workers are nowadays more inclined to leave their jobs if their leaders are not morally authoritative as well. So, strive for moral authority, \u201cthe recognition of a person\u2019s leadership influence based on who\u00a0they are more\u00a0than the position they hold.\u201d\nThis is perhaps the most important leadershift of the eleven, the one that \u201cwill bring the greatest change to your life and the lives of those around you.\u201d Unlike trained leaders who both act and teach following by-the-book guidelines, transformational leaders encourage and inspire people around them to become more through their very existence. So, don\u2019t forget that Gandhian adage, paraphrased by Maxwell thus: \u201cIf you want to see positive changes in your world, the first person you must change is you. As leaders, you and I have to be changed to bring change. We teach what we know, but we reproduce who we are.\u201d\nThere are three kinds of people in the world: 1) those\u00a0who merely do a job,\u00a02) those\u00a0who want to have a career; and 3) those who have a calling. Great leaders can only be born out of those in the third category. So, it\u2019s not about becoming a leader just because you want to emulate your idols: it\u2019s because you can\u2019t be anything else and your skillset is suitable for the job. It\u2019s like Aristotle said: \u201cWhere our talents and the needs of the world cross, there lies our vocation.\u201d So, by definition, your calling is never merely about you, but about the whole world as well: \u201ca calling moves us from the center of everything in our world to becoming the channel through which good things come to others.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cLeadershift\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 From Leadership to Leadershift: the World Is Changing, and You Need to Adapt\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The 7 Fundamental Leadership Practices\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The 11 Leadershifts Every Leader Should Make\nFrom Leadership to Leadershift: the World Is Changing, and You Need to Adapt\nEverything is changing so fast nowadays, that the only ones able to keep up with the pace are the flexible ones.\nAdaptability is, by far, the most important trait a modern leader should possess. It is so important, in fact, that leadership can be better defined as leadershift nowadays\u2014something that requires constant adjustments and change.\nAs Maxwell writes, today, \u201cevery advance you make as a leader will require a Leadershift that changes the way you think, act, and lead.\u201d\nThe 7 Fundamental Leadership Practices\nWith the above in mind, these are the 7 fundamental leadership practices of the 21\n century:\n#1. Continually learn, unlearn and relearn. \n#2. Value yesterday but live in today. \n#3. Rely on speed but thrive on timing. \n#4. See the big picture as the picture keeps getting bigger.\n#5. Live in today, but think about tomorrow. \n#6. Move forward courageously in the midst of uncertainty.\n#7. Realize today\u2019s best will not meet tomorrow\u2019s challenges.\u00a0\nThe 11 Leadershifts Every Leader Should Make\nEven more important than the leadership practices above are the eleven leadershifts, dubbed by Maxwell as the \u201cessential changes every leader must embrace.\u201d They are:\n. Great leaders are never soloists: they orchestrate.\n Goals are great, but growth is better. Be growth-oriented.\n Great leaders don\u2019t think about what they can get out of their position: they are focused on what they can give.\n Stop worrying about pleasing people: start challenging them.\n Tradition doesn\u2019t work as well as it used to: instead of maintaining the old ways, focus on creating new rituals.\n Become an equipper: build ladders for your employees, and not for yourself (in fact, the latter will happen simultaneously).\n Stop ordering people around: connect with them.\n Bring to your team people who are different than you, even such that don\u2019t agree with your strategies: dissent breeds progress.\n You\u2019re not a leader because of your position, but because of your character. Never forget that.\n Don\u2019t settle with being a trained leader: become a transformational one who inspires and encourages other people to become more than they are.\n Becoming a leader should never be a career move: great leaders are the ones who have a calling to become that.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cLeadershift Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nUntil about a decade ago, whenever John C. Maxwell published a new book\u2014and that occurred quite often\u2014it was such an event that the first edition was sometimes be sold out before the book had actually hit the shelves.\u00a0\nHowever, since Maxwell started being a bit repetitive (he is too prolific to not be), that changed a bit recently. Fortunately, \nis as fresh and as insightful as his best and most renowned books.

And Why?\nis written by a tennis instructor and, though it uses tennis as a metaphor to talk about other things as well, most of its conclusions and advices would interest tennis players (or athletes, in general) the most.\nHowever, give it a go even if you\u2019re an entrepreneur: it may boost your performance by telling you when you should be a \n, and when just a \n.\nThe Inner Game of Tennis Summary\n\u201cEvery game is composed of two parts,\u201d writes tennis instructor W. Timothy Gallwey, \u201can outer game and an inner game.\u201d\nIt is, he goes on, the inner game you need to win so as to have any chance in winning the outer game.\nWondering what that means in practice?\nWe\u2019re here to explain.\nThe Outer and the Inner Game of Tennis\nThe outer game is the one played against an external opponent to overcome external obstacles and to reach an external goal. \nIf you\u2019re playing the game of tennis, then mastering the outer game means learning how to position your arms and legs, how to swing a racket, or how to improve your forehand. The goal, of course, is to beat your opponent and, in the long run, win Wimbledon.\nThere are many books which offer instructions on how to achieve this; but, for some reason, reminds as Gallwey, \u201cmost of us find these instructions easier to remember than to execute.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s where the inner game of tennis comes into play.\nThis is the game that takes place inside the mind of a player. It, too, includes some obstacles: lapses in concentration, nervousness, self-doubt, and self-condemnation. It, too, has a goal: proper preparation for the outer-game instructions.\nIn short, you play the outer game to beat your opponent; you play the inner one to beat your own self, \u201cto overcome all habits of mind which inhibit excellence in performance.\u201d\nThis\nbook is about the latter.\n\u201cThere is a far more natural and effective process for learning and doing almost anything than most of us realize,\u201d writes Gallwey in the \u201cIntroduction\u201d to his book. \u201cIt is similar to the process we all used, but soon forgot, as we learned to walk and talk. It uses the intuitive capabilities of the mind and both the right and left hemispheres of the brain. This process doesn\u2019t have to be learned; we already know it. All that is needed is to \n those habits which interfere with it and then to just \n.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see how that works in actual life.\nThe Discovery of Two Selves\n\u201cDon\u2019t think about elephants,\u201d says Arthur to Saito in \nto make a point.\n\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d \u201cElephants,\u201d replies Saito.\nCalled \n, this thinking process is a demonstration of the main reason why you might be losing the outer game of tennis (or negotiation, or business, or life) no matter how prepared you are.\nSimply put, you are not \n to play it as consciously as you\u2019d like to believe.\nYou are, in other words, a \n: you think that you are one indivisible individual, when, in fact, you consist of two very different selves:\n\u2022 Self 1: Your Conscious Mind;\n\u2022 Self 2: Your Unconscious Mind.\nThe reason why you are incapable of \n thinking about elephants when asked to is that there\u2019s a breakdown in communication between the two selves: Self 1 tells Self 2 to do this, but Self 2 isn\u2019t rational by definition.\nAnd therein lies the problem: using conscious effort to overcome self-doubt or lack of focus and concentration is like using a hammer to paint a wall\u2014the tool is utterly unusable and may, in fact, cause problems rather than lead to proper solutions.\nWe\u2019ve talked about one real-world basketball example: Nick Anderson.\n, the guy was a good free throw shooter, scoring, on average, 3 out of four free throws. However, after missing four very important ones, he went from that to scoring only 1 of 4!\nOf course, he still had the same skills. \nThe problem was\u2014\n\u2014that, instead of shooting on autopilot (Self2), Anderson started \n himself (Self 1) to shoot better.\nAnd that\u2019s the very definition of choking.\nThe Miscommunication Between the Selves\nIn short, the nub of this problem\u2014\n\u2014is \n and \n \n between the two selves that comprise you.\nBut, let\u2019s break down this sentence so you can understand it better.\nSelf 1 is the smart guy in your body: he is the one that\u2019s doing all the thinking, organizing, strategizing and analyzing\u2014from every possible angle; he does this in a pretty slow, careful, and meticulous manner.\nSelf 2, on the other hand, is the doer: he is the one that absorbs all the knowledge when it turns into habit; consequently, \n.\nSelf 1, in other words, is you copying text from one document, pasting it in another, and clicking Enter afterward\u2014and doing this manually a hundred times; Self 2 is the script that Self 1 quickly jots down to do this automatically.\nWhy?\nWell, Self 1 doesn\u2019t want to waste energy solving solved problems a thousand times. There are simply too many problems around, so, after realizing that a particular string of steps works in a particular scenario, it relocates this pattern from the realm of the conscious to the realm of the unconscious; and then Self 2 takes things over and does all the work.\nWhen you choke, this system works backward: Self 1 stops trusting Self 2 to do a job it has done millions of times before immaculately and takes the reins.\nSo, even though Self 2 embodies \n the potential you have developed up to a certain moment\u2014and, thus, is far more competent to control the muscle system than Self 1\u2014Self 1, the slow talker, hijacks your body.\nAnd, when it doesn\u2019t respond properly, starts admonishing it by shouting things like \u201cStop being so nervous!\u201d \u201cYou fool!\u201d etc.\nFortunately, there\u2019s a two-step way out.\nStep 1: Quiet Self 1\nIt is, evidently, \u201cthe constant \u2018thinking\u2019 activity of Self 1, the ego-mind, which causes interference with the natural capabilities of Self 2. Harmony between the two selves exists when this mind is quiet and focused. Only then can peak performance be reached.\u201d\nIn other words, you\u2019re \u201cin the zone\u201d when you\u2019re \n thinking about \n, \n or even \n to hit the ball. \nHell, when you\u2019re in the zone, you\u2019re not even \n to hit the ball: you just \n it. And, afterward, you\u2019re not thinking about the quality of the shot: you\u2019re just waiting for the next ball.\nLike a machine.\n\u201cThe ball,\u201d says Gallwey, \u201cseems to get hit through a process which doesn\u2019t require thought. There may be an awareness of the sight, sound, and feel of the ball, and even of the tactical situation, but the player just seems to \n without thinking what to do.\u201d\n\u201cMan is a thinking reed,\u201d wrote Zen master D. T. Suzuki, \u201cbut his great works are done when he is not calculating and thinking. \u2018Childlikeness\u2019 has to be restored\u2026\u201d\nWhat does this mean?\nIt means that the first step toward mastery is quieting all thought\u2014and especially judgmental thought\u2014and seeing things as a child would, i.e., not \n(in the past or the future), but with serenity and relaxation (in the now).\nThis is what Gallwey calls \n. \n\u201cWhen we \u2018unlearn\u2019 judgment,\u201d he says, \u201cwe discover, usually with some surprise, that we don\u2019t need the motivation of a reformer to change our \u2018bad\u2019 habits. We may simply need to be more aware.\u201d\nIf so, that means that, almost counter-intuitively, if you want to get better at something you\u2019ve been learning your whole life, the best thing to do is to\u2026 \n \n.\nInstead\u2026\nStep 2: Trust Self 2\nTrusting Self 2 means trusting the scripts planted inside your body, i.e., \n things happen.\n\u201c\n it happen is not \n it happen,\u201d writes Gallwey in the most quotable sentence from the book. \u201cIt is not \n hard. It is \n your shots.\u201d\nWhy?\nBecause these are all actions of Self 1, which only takes things into its own hands when it doesn\u2019t trust Self 2 enough. \n\u201cThis is what produces tight muscles, rigid swings, awkward movements, gritted teeth and tense cheek muscles,\u201d Gallwey goes on. \u201cThe results are mishit balls and a lot of frustration. Often when we are rallying, we trust our bodies and let it happen because the ego-mind tells itself that it doesn\u2019t really count. But once the game begins, watch Self 1 take over; at the crucial point, it starts to doubt whether Self 2 will perform well. The more important the point, the more Self 1 may try to control the shot, and this is exactly when tightening up occurs. The results are almost always frustrating.\u201d\nTo sum up, nothing good comes out of Self 1 trying to micromanage Self 2: on the contrary, in fact, this is a very certain and definite recipe for disaster.\nSelf 2 is very good at performing tasks which are automatic, like riding a bike or driving a car. It\u2019s when you start thinking about how complex are the things you are doing that you may make a mistake.\nA great tactic to prevent yourself from this is visualizing yourself on the court long before the match begins: to Self 2, a picture is worth a thousand words.\nA good rule of thumb is until you get it right in your head, your Self 1 won\u2019t trust your Self 2. \nSo, \n!\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Inner Game of Tennis\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You Consist Of Two Selves: The Conscious and the Unconscious You\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Choking is the Product of Miscommunication Between the Two Selves\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To Get Better: Quiet Self 1 and Trust Self 2 More\nYou Consist Of Two Selves: The Conscious and the Unconscious You\nHe may have been wrong about many things, \u00a0but \n was definitely right about one: people are not whole and complete beings, but pretty fragmented creatures.\nThere\u2019s a contest inside our bodies, and tennis instructor W. Timothy Gallwey refers to this contest as the inner game of tennis: before you\u2019re capable of beating your opponent, you need to find a way to beat yourself.\nOr better yet: to balance the two selves which are inside you.\nThe first one is the conscious self: the thinking entity; the latter one is the unconscious self: the doing entity. It is Self 1 which comes up with solutions; it is Self 2 which puts them into practice.\nChoking is the Product of Miscommunication Between the Two Selves\nChoking is the result of miscommunication between these two selves: Self 1 takes over things which are in the domain of Self 2 believing that it will make them better\u2014when, in truth, Self 2 does a pretty great job \nwhen not interfered.\nFortunately, there\u2019s a way to prevent this; but it\u2019s counter-intuitive.\nTo Get Better: Quiet Self 1 and Trust Self 2 More\nIt is only normal that the first thing you\u2019d do when things would start to go awry is you activate Self 1: it is the smart part of you, so it should have a solution.\nUnfortunately, in this case, Self 1 is \nthe problem: you don\u2019t need to think when you\u2019re driving or riding a bike, and, just as well, you don\u2019t need to think when you\u2019re shooting free throws or playing tennis.\nYou just need to do stuff.\nWell, Self 1 isn\u2019t very good at doing things: it doesn\u2019t know your body as well as Self 2 does.

And Why?\n\u201cIf you want to understand how successful groups work\u2014the signals they transmit, the language they speak, the cues that foster creativity\u2014you won\u2019t find a more essential guide than \n\u201d wrote none other than Charles Duhigg, author of \n.\nRecommended especially for leaders, managers, and CEOs who want to organize their employees into unified, cohesive, and unstoppable juggernauts of work teams.\nThe Culture Code Summary\nAfter demonstrating in \n that individual greatness isn\u2019t born, but grown, in \n,\nDaniel Coyle turns to team greatness and tries to uncover the secrets of highly successful groups.\nAnd he starts with a simple question: \nIntroduction\nFortunately for Coyle, Peter Skillman, a designer and engineer, tried to give an answer to the question above just a few years ago via an interesting series of studies which included a simple challenge: building the tallest possible structure using the four following items:\n\u2022 twenty pieces of uncooked spaghetti\n\u2022 one yard of transparent tape\n\u2022 one yard of string\n\u2022 one standard-size marshmallow\nThe only two rules of the contest were: \n\u2022 the marshmallow had to end up on top\n\u2022 the groups had to consist of four people\nThe business students who took participation in this experiment were \u201cprofessional, rational, and intelligent.\u201d They started by examining the materials and devising a proper strategy. Then they divided up the tasks and started building.\nInterestingly, neither they nor the lawyers or the CEOs built the tallest structures. It was, believe it or not, the kindergartners that won.\n\u201cIn dozens of trials,\u201d writes Coyle, \u201ckindergartners built structures that averaged twenty-six inches tall, while business school students built structures that averaged less than ten inches.\u201d In case you\u2019re wondering, the towers of the lawyers\u2019 averaged fifteen inches and those of the CEOs twenty-two.\nSo, what happened? How did the kindergartners do it?\nStrangely enough, by \n strategizing or analyzing anything beforehand. They just started building, abruptly grabbing materials from one another and speaking in short bursts: \u201cHere! No, \n!\u201d Their entire technique was nothing more but \n.\n\u201cThe kindergartners succeed not because they are smarter,\u201d writes Coyle, \u201cbut because they work together in a smarter way. They are tapping into a simple and powerful method in which a group of ordinary people can create a performance far beyond the sum of their parts.\u201d\nThe Method\nUnsurprisingly, Coyle\u2019s book\u2014and, consequently, our summary\u2014is the story of how and why the kindergarten method works.\nIts final formulation, of course, owes a lot to modern scientific findings, but also, even more, to Coyle\u2019s dedicated research: he spent four years visiting and researching \u201ceight of the world\u2019s most successful groups, including a special-ops military unit, an inner-city school, a professional basketball team, a movie studio, a comedy troupe, a gang of jewel thieves, and others.\u201d\nTo be subject of his research, the groups had to have the following three qualifications:\n\u2022 they had to have performed in the top 1 percent of their domain for at least a decade (where applicable);\n\u2022 they had to have succeeded with a range of different personnel; and\n\u2022 they had to have built a culture admired by knowledgeable people across their industry and beyond.\nWhat Coyle found was that all of these cultures are created by a specific set of skills. These skills, he says, tap into the power of our social brains to create interactions exactly like the ones used by the kindergartners building the spaghetti tower. Interestingly, they are three in total:\n: \u201csignals of connection generate bonds of belonging and identity.\u201d \n: \u201chabits of mutual risk drive trusting cooperation.\u201d\n: \u201cnarratives create shared goals and values.\u201d \n\u201cThe three skills work together from the bottom up,\u201d Coyle writes, \u201cfirst building group connection and then channeling it into action.\u201d\nSo, let\u2019s explore how each of these skills works\u2014both in theory and in practice!\nSkill 1 \u00b7 Build Safety\nNick is a handsome, dark-haired man in his twenties with a simple mission: to sabotage the performance of a four-person group in a wood-paneled conference room in Seattle.\nIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s a bad person or something: he\u2019s merely part of an experiment run by the not-so-mad Australian scientist Will Felps.\nFelps has hired Nick so as to investigate organizational behavior, and, with this in mind, has tasked him to portray three negative archetypes inside forty different four-person groups tasked with devising a marketing plan for a start-up.\nThe negative archetypes in question are the following:\n\u2022 The Jerk: an aggressive, defiant deviant;\n\u2022 The Slacker: a withholder of effort; and \n\u2022 The Downer: a depressive Eeyore type.\nFor obvious reasons, Felps calls this \u201cthe bad apple\u201d experiment.\nFor even more obvious reason, the results are not at all surprising: almost all groups react the way a body would if injected with a deadly virus\u2014after some struggle, they discover that resistance is futile and give up.\nThe only exception: the Jonathan group.\nThe reason?\nThe Jonathan group has, well, a Jonathan, \u201ca thin, curly-haired young man with a quiet, steady voice and an easy smile,\u201d who constantly counters Nick\u2019s efforts to ruin everything with warmth and understanding.\nBasically, he works as an antiviral medication: he deflects the effects of Nick\u2019s behavior, making everybody around him feel safe and secure.\nThe conclusion of this study\u2014and a few similar ones\u2014is twofold:\n\u2022 Group performance doesn\u2019t depend solely on measurable abilities like intelligence, skill, and experience: small \u201cbad apple\u201d behaviors are capable of ruining everything;\n\u2022 Bad apples can be countered via something called belonging cues: if a member of a group makes the other members feel safe, protected, and solidly connected, the \u201cbad apple\u201d effects are canceled out.\nIn other words, if you want a group that will outperform its members, then you want them to be solidly connected, i.e., to form a single body from which everyone benefits.\nThe key thing to do that is building a safe environment by \u201cdialing into small, subtle moments and delivering targeted signals at key points.\u201d\nHere are a few tips for doing that:\n. Smooth turn-taking sessions peopled with listeners and not interrupters are the hallmark of successful cultures; the only words allowed: \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cuh-huh,\u201d and \u201cgotcha\u201d\u2014of course, until your turn comes.\n\u2022 \n. Nobody\u2019s perfect\u2014that\u2019s not merely an aphorism \nengraved it in our minds, but the starting point on your journey to build a successful culture; \n. It\u2019s literal\u2014that\u2019s precisely what \n, Billy Donovan, and even Ray Croc did. It sends a powerful egalitarian signal: \n.\n. Don\u2019t just tolerate bad feedback\u2014welcome and accept it.\nSneak-preview future relationships, making small but telling connections between now and a vision of the future.\n. You know what Gregg Popovich says at the end of each basketball season? \u201cThank you for allowing me to coach you.\u201d Thanking ignites cooperative behavior\u2014and is almost \nover the top.\nntering a new group can be stressful \nyou make it enjoyable; the latter creates together-moments\u2014and groups;\n. It\u2019s a bad idea to give negative feedback wrapped between two positives\u2014it leads to confusion.\nThe rest of the tips are pretty self-explanatory:\n\u2022 \nSkill 2 \u00b7 Share Vulnerability\nThe reason why the \u201cbad apple\u201d experiment works so well is quite simple: just like most animals, humans are exceptionally good at picking up subtle clues and mirroring other people\u2019s behaviors.\nThis is the reason why you may sometimes be amazed at some of the actions of your child, wondering \u201cwhen and how did he/she learn to do that?\u201d It is also the reason why acting as if you know everything when you only know something will create a culture of pseudo-competent employees who\u2019d never dare to share their vulnerabilities.\nIt works the other way around: when \n, as a leader, are\nthe one willing to share his vulnerabilities first, then everybody will follow.\nThe result?\nA group of people who know \n what they know between them, and who are pretty aware both of their failings and their strengths at any moment.\nJeff Polzer calls this mechanism the vulnerability loop: admitting weaknesses results in cooperation because it signals other group members that they can do the same.\nAnd you know who you are comfortable with sharing your weaknesses?\nOf course\u2014the people you trust the most.\n\u201cNormally,\u201d writes Coyle, \u201cwe think about trust and vulnerability the way we think about standing on solid ground and leaping into the unknown: first we build trust, \n we leap. But science is showing us that we\u2019ve got it backward. Vulnerability doesn\u2019t come after trust\u2014it precedes it. Leaping into the unknown, when done alongside others, causes the solid ground of trust to materialize beneath our feet.\u201d\nThat\u2019s basically the essence of Kierkegaard\u2019s existential \u201cleap of faith\u201d and the reason why Bren\u00e9 Brown is so adamant that \n.\n\u201cBuilding habits of group vulnerability is like building a muscle,\u201d writes Coyle. \u201cIt takes time, repetition, and the willingness to feel pain in order to achieve gains.\u201d\nWith that in mind, he offers a few workout ideas, both for individuals and for groups:\n\u2022 \n. The Leader is the one who sets the example: his vulnerability isn\u2019t a weakness, it\u2019s his strength.\nDon\u2019t just expect collaboration to happen on its own: send clear signals that it is a prerogative.\n. You are obligated to deliver negative feedback face-to-face: not easy, but necessary to create shared clarity and connection.\nThe moments are the first vulnerability and the first disagreement.\n. Or, in other words: nod attentively and gain amplitude by repetition.\n. Skilled listeners don\u2019t interrupt to make suggestions or give obvious solutions: resist the temptation.\n\u2022 \nLearn to endure\nemotional pain and a sense of inefficiency.\n. Don\u2019t just talk the talk\u2014walk the walk as well.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u201cIt is exactly like traditional mentoring\u2014you pick someone you want to learn from and shadow them\u2014except that instead of months or years, it lasts a few hours.\u201d\n. Just like Greg Popovich, leave your team to think on its own and reach a decision independently from time to time. It will.\nSkill 3 \u00b7 Establish Purpose\nAs Yuval Noah Harari \n, the difference between humans and other animals is not only that we\u2019re smarter, but also that, by being smarter, we are able to share beliefs, even when they are not true.\nIn his exceptional and wide-ranging book, \n, Mark W. Moffett made an even bolder step, claiming that without shared beliefs, humans would have remained chimpanzees and would have never created societies.\nWhat does that tell us about work culture and teamwork?\nPrecisely what you would expect it to tell us: \n are teams and those who don\u2019t are just a collection of distrustful individuals.\nAnd common purposes come pre-packed in narrative arcs: facts may do nothing for us, but stories we like so much that \nScience has recently discovered why it is so: when we listen to facts, our brains are barely active. However, when we listen to stories, they are actively engaged.\nOur immediate reaction to a story is one of interest and curiosity: we can\u2019t help ourselves from believing that they have some greater meaning and that some events in the story are causes, and others effects.\nUsing this to create purpose-driven work culture, however, is not easy: it goes beyond devising a mission statement and a few catchphrases. As Coyle says, \u201cit\u2019s a never-ending process of trying, failing, reflecting, and above all, learning.\u201d\n\u201cHigh-purpose environments don\u2019t descend on groups from on high,\u201d writes Coyle. \u201cthey are dug out of the ground, over and over, as a group navigates its problems together and evolves to meet the challenges of a fast-changing world.\u201d\nThese are his tips to help you do that:\n\u2022 \n. In order to move toward a target, you must first \n one. \u201cMost successful groups end up with a small handful of priorities (five or fewer), and many, not coincidentally, end up placing their in-group relationships\u2014how they treat one another\u2014at the top of the list.\u201d\nOvercommunicate\nyour priorities: employees do not see the things as their leaders do.\n.\nThe key is, once again, clarity: by strictly separating these areas, you can tailor your leadership accordingly. Creativity asks for a different leader than proficiency.\n. Keep them simple, forthright, and action-oriented, so that they can work as \u201cclear reminders, crisp nudges in the direction the group wants to go.\u201d\n. There\u2019s too much noise and endless alternative purposes out there. Create simple universal measures that place focus on what matters to keep you on track.\n. Embed your environment with artifacts which embody your purpose and identity.\n. Spotlight a small, effortful behavior that transmits, amplifies, and celebrates the purpose of the whole group.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Culture Code\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Successful Groups Feel Safe\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Successful Groups Share Their Vulnerabilities and Know Their Real Advantages\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Successful Groups Have a Clear and Unchanging Purpose\nSuccessful Groups Feel Safe\nThe reason why you\u2019d rather spend your time with people you know than with strangers is quite simple: you don\u2019t feel safe in the latter case.\nThe same is true when it comes to your work environment: if leaders don\u2019t build safety, then it\u2019s every man for himself.\nAnd that\u2019s not a team, but a group of individuals.\nSuccessful Groups Share Their Vulnerabilities and Know Their Real Advantages\nA great way to build safety and trust at your workplace is by sharing your weaknesses. \nIt may seem counter-intuitive (usually, we share our vulnerabilities only with people who we already trust), but studies have shown that it is actually the other way around: vulnerability breeds trust.\nAnd if you are a leader, make sure that you are the one who is vulnerable first\u2014and often.\nSuccessful Groups Have a Clear and Unchanging Purpose\nWhat unites work groups is the same thing which unites bands, sports teams, religious groups, and even nations: common, shared purpose.\nWithout it, there\u2019s nothing to work as adhesive tissue, nothing to glue the individuals into a single body.\nWith it, suddenly, it\u2019s all about \n.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nThe Culture Code Quotes\nFinal Notes\nNamed one of the best books of the year by both \n and \n, \nis both simple and comprehensive, both enjoyable and applicable.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting years for someone to write this book,\u201d wrote Adam Grant, author of \nand\nin a review full of praises. \u201cIt is even better than I imagined.

And Why?\nDrawing on the very latest findings in the social sciences, \n reveals some things which, as its blurb states, have \u201cimportant implications in politics, business, and marketing, as well as in science and everyday life.\u201d\nConsequently, it is not an exaggeration to say that this book is for everyone. You\u2019ll enjoy it very much if you like to read about biases and prejudices, about human behavior and the problems with future predictions.\nEverything is Obvious Summary\nPART I COMMON SENSE\n\u201cCommon sense is so ordinary that we tend to notice it only when it\u2019s missing,\u201d notes Duncan James Watts in the first chapter of \nAnd just like many ordinary things which are around us all the time\u2014like, say, time itself\u2014it is also pretty difficult to define it.\n\u201cRoughly speaking,\u201d informs us Watts, common sense \u201cis the loosely organized set of facts, observations, experiences, insights, and pieces of received wisdom that each of us accumulates over a lifetime, in the course of encountering, dealing with, and learning from, everyday situations.\u201d\nIn practical terms, it is what tells you to \ngo to work \n on, or, say, cheat your trusting friend out of his money. It is what lies buried inside proverbs, aphorisms, and saying\u2014you know, the obvious thing.\nInterestingly enough, as sociologists are fond of pointing out pretty often, many of these aphorisms appear to be direct contradictions of each other. \nFor example, birds of a feather flock together, but opposites attract. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, but out of sight is out of mind. Look before you leap, but, then again, he who hesitates is lost. \u00a0\n\u201cOf course,\u201d notes Watts, \u201cit is not necessarily the case that these beliefs are contradictory\u2014because we invoke different aphorisms in different circumstances. But because we never specify the conditions under which one aphorism applies versus another, we have no way of describing what it is that we really think or why we think it.\u201d\n\u201cCommon sense,\u201d he concludes, \u201cis not so much a worldview as a grab bag of logically inconsistent, often contradictory beliefs, each of which seems right at the time but carries no guarantee of being right any other time.\u201d\nOf course, if something is a grab bag of logically inconsistent beliefs, and if that grab bag is carried by virtually every human on this planet, then we\u2019re bound to misuse it\u2014and it seems, we do this quite often.\nWatts is not talking about day-to-day situations: everyday life, he says, is effectively broken up into small problems, grounded in very specific contexts, and in cases such as these, using your common sense is quite harmless, even beneficial.\nHowever, when we use common sense to solve problems that are \n grounded in \u201cthe immediate \n\u201d\u2014that\u2019s when we\u2019re bound to make serious mistakes.\nWhat kind of problems are we talking about?\nWell, practically every problem which involves us \u201canticipating or managing the behavior of large numbers of people, in situations that are distant from us either in time or space.\u201d\nYou\u2019ve never done this?\nWhat about every single discussion you\u2019ve had about politics, or economics, or the Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, or the healthcare plan?\nWell, sorry to burst your bubble, but what you were doing in most of these cases was nothing short of ridiculous: applying your common sense to talk about problems such as these is as wrong as applying nail polish to your eyes. \nSimply put, that\u2019s \nwhat common sense is for. And some people\u2014the actual politicians and economists\u2014do this all the time. And there\u2014now you know why there are so many problems around the world.\nThe main problem with common sense is this: when you use it wrong, it doesn\u2019t allow you for a minute to see that you\u2019re wrong, because, simply put, that is also part of its job.\nAnd \n and \n have repeatedly demonstrated to us that \n because our brain is haunted by a host of thinking demons called biases which can easily be turned against us by people who know how to command them.\nOne way to do this is to \n these demons in the preferable direction, by making the option you\u2019d like for another one to make the default one.\nDon\u2019t believe it works?\nConsider this: in Germany, only one in ten people (about 12%) agreed to be an organ donor over the course of one year. In Austria, on the other hand, ten in ten (99%) did that.\nWhy? What could be so different about these two countries, populated by virtually the same people?\nWell, just one small thing: in Austria, the default choice is to be an organ donor, whereas in Germany the default is \n to be. \nWatts writes: \u201cThe difference in policies seems trivial\u2014it\u2019s just the difference between having to mail in a simple form and not having to\u2014but it\u2019s enough to push the donor rate from 12 percent to 99.9 percent.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s not an isolated case: \u201cwhat was true for Austria and Germany was true across all of Europe\u2014all the countries with very high rates of organ donation had opt-out policies, while the countries with low rates were all opt-in.\u201d\nAnother way to trick another person into doing something he/she might not like is through a technique called priming, i.e., influencing a decision with particular words, sounds, or other stimuli.\nFor example, subjects in experiments who read words like \u201cold\u201d and \u201cfrail\u201d walk more slowly down the corridor when they leave the lab compared to those who read words such as \u201cyoung\u201d and \u201cvivacious.\u201d \nAlso, consumers in wine stores are more likely to buy German wine when German music is playing in the background, and French wine when French music is playing; \nPossibly even stranger, when asked about energy drinks, consumers are more likely to name \u201cGatorade\u201d when given a green pen in order to fill out a given survey. \nFinally\u2014and most fascinatingly\u2014\u201dshoppers looking to buy a couch online are more likely to opt for an expensive, comfortable-looking couch when the background of the website is of fluffy white clouds, and more likely to buy the harder, cheaper option when the background consists of dollar coins.\u201d\nStill think that couch you bought and the wine you\u2019ll be drinking tonight was your choice?\nThere\u2019s yet a third technique to influence someone else\u2019s common sense thinking. \nIt\u2019s called anchoring, and it basically consists of skewing the response of another person in the desired direction by giving him \n numerical information.\nThat\u2019s what the \u201csuggested donation\u201d is for: to make you give\u2014and you will, almost always\u2014at least as much or more than the suggested amount.\nHave you ever given less?\nWe neither.\nAlready afraid that you\u2019re being willfully manipulated by your common sense (and by those who know how it works) on a daily basis?\nThe bad news is that Watts is not done with the biases and all the failings of these common sense thinking methods.\nAs the title suggests, in the third chapter, he goes over some of the reasons why there are things such as tulipomania and speculative bubbles, exploring the wisdom\u2014and much more \n\u2014of crowds.\nAsk anyone which is the most beautiful painting in the world, and he/she will probably tell you that it\u2019s Da Vinci\u2019s \n.\nAsk him why and he/she is bound to offer some explanations: the enigmatic smile, the perfect use of light, the fantastical background, etc.\nIt\u2019s, after all, commonsense knowledge, isn\u2019t it?\nThat\u2019s the problem: it\u2019s commonsense knowledge because it is commonsense knowledge. \nIn other words, if these qualities were intrinsic to \n and to no other painting, then it would have been easier to explain: maybe beauty is in them; however, in other paintings, these same things don\u2019t inspire as much admiration.\nTo remind ourselves of the Euthyphro dilemma: \u201cis \n beautiful because of its beauty, or is it beautiful because people say it is?\u201d\nUnfortunately, it is the latter. Even if we say Mona Lisa is beautiful because it is a combination of all of these attributes at once, we\u2019re once again thinking circularly.\n\u201cWe claim to be saying that the Mona Lisa is the most famous painting in the world because it has attributes X, Y, \n Z. But really what we\u2019re saying is that the Mona Lisa is famous because it\u2019s more like the Mona Lisa than anything else.\u201d\nIn short, what you\u2019re saying is that Mona Lisa is the best painting out there because other people have said that before you and \nyou\u2019re trying to find reasons to justify your thoughts.\nThis latter part is something sociologists refer to as cumulative advantage. Watts himself devised an experiment to demonstrate how it works in practice.\nHe divided people into two groups, asking each of the members of the groups to rate the songs they like the most. One of the groups, however\u2014the treatment group\u2014could \nhow many times each of the songs had been downloaded.\nThe result?\nThe treatment group rated these songs higher than the others, downloading them more often than the control group!\nLike it or not, the 21\n century, so far, seems to be \n, i.e., people capable of influencing whole networks of people.\nThe idea that such a thing is possible in the first place dates back to 1967 when Stanley Milgram did an experiment involving 300 people in two separate cities. He asked them to pass a message to a friend of theirs by first handing it over to a stranger.\nHis conclusions are famous to this day: on average, it took six connections for a message to reach the desired destination (hence, six degrees of separation), and nearly half of the messages passed through the hands of three individuals.\nThese individuals are basically what we now term influencers: they are the dream of marketers and the shortcut to fame. Pay Kim Kardashian $10,000 to tweet your product, and you\u2019re bound to make some money.\nHowever, Watts tried to replicate this experiment on a grander lab-free scale and discovered that one of these conclusions is wrong.\nWatts and his collaborators (Roby Muhamad and Peter Dodds) used emails instead of letters and included 60,000 people in over 166 countries.\nRemarkably, on average, it still took roughly seven steps for a message to reach its final recipient. However, no hubs were created: \u201cmessages reached their targets through almost as many recipients as there were chains.\u201d\nThe reason why you believe that there \nsuch a thing as an influencer is common sense: it sounds reasonable that there are some people who are more connected than others. \nThe truth is that, in real-life networks, we each play an important role in spreading information and paying $10,000 to Kim Kardashian for a single tweet may eventually amount to the same result as paying 10,000 people $1 dollar for 10,000 tweets.\n\u201cThe only thing we learn from history,\u201d quipped once George Bernard Shaw, \u201cis that we learn nothing from history.\u201d\nWell, sociologists now know that this is true. But, they say, it is not because we don\u2019t pay enough attention or because we don\u2019t know our history enough; it is the opposite: we pay too much attention, and we think we know too much about our history.\nHistory, unfortunately, is run only once and we can\u2019t turn back the time. Consequently, it is the very opposite of an experiment: nothing we claim to have learned from it is the result of rigorous testing.\nPut simpler, the same people act differently in two different contexts. So why should the same events\u2014or even strings of events\u2014cause the same consequences if they happen in two different periods of time?\nNaturally, they won\u2019t. We just think they would.\nAnd, once again, the culprit is our common sense: intuitively, we think that we know precisely what caused what, but unlike the people who lived through these events, we analyze them in retrospect. \nAnd there\u2019s a big difference: the people who actually lived through them couldn\u2019t have seen what we think they must have.\nIt\u2019s even more frightening than this: history is told by people with biases in narrative sentences. And narrative sentences murk the difference between myth and reality, something which is further muddled by the interests of the chronicler.\nAdd to this that it is the winners who write history and you\u2019re in quite the pickle: has anything that ever happened really happened in the way we think it did?\nAnd if we can\u2019t tell so many things about the past, how are we so sure that we can predict the future\u2014something central to planning, policy, strategy, management, marketing, etc.?\nWell, that\u2019s once again our common sense leading us astray: future, as \ncommon sense, is absolutely unpredictable (anything can happen at any time), and numerous people have learned this the hard way.\nFor example, thousands and thousands of them have lost money investing in things investors told them would inevitably bring them some fast cash. Something happens, though, and the money is suddenly lost.\nAfter it happens, there are many people who\u2019d tell you what the original problem was. However, just taking into consideration what we told you above about history and hindsight, how do we know if these people knew beforehand or are just predicting things \n the events?\nWell, if you ask Nassim Nicholas Taleb whom Watts quotes, the answer should be fairly obvious: it is the latter, aka the people who say they had known something would happen beforehand, are merely lying to themselves.\nBecause of two unshakably real things: \n.\nAs defined by Wikipedia, survivorship bias is the \u201clogical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility.\u201d\nIn other words, out of a million people who\u2019d attempt to predict a future, it is statistically very likely that at least a few would guess right. The problem: you\u2019d \n hear about them.\nBut \n \nwould probably fail to predict the black swan events, i.e., events so unpredictable that nobody believes when they happen. (Hence the name: European settlers in Australia were stunned to find out that there \nblack swans, contrary to a popular commonsense Roman saying.)\nTo wrap up, before 9/11, nobody could have predicted the attack. But how should we organize ourselves to be safe against them?\nPART II UNCOMMON SENSE\nSo, predicting things your common sense says are predictable is almost impossible\u2014for two reasons: there are multiple possible futures, and we\u2019re focusing on one, \n there are billions of unimportant things that influence other things, and we can only think of the things that matter.\nIn addition, \u201cpredicting black swans is\u2026 doubly hopeless,\u201d notes Watts, \u201cbecause until history has played out, it\u2019s impossible even to know what the relevant terms are.\u201d\nHowever, as any good poker player can tell you, even though \u201ccounting cards won\u2019t tell you exactly which card is going to show up next\u2026 by knowing the odds better than your opponents, you can still make a lot of money over time by placing more informed bets and winning more often than you lose.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s precisely why some predictions\u2014whether in poker or sporting events\u2014work better than the rest: they take part in something called the prediction market.\nThe prediction market is basically the survivorship bias turned on its head: you take into account \n of the predictions, and that helps you make better-informed forecast.\nThis is what James Surowiecki dubs \u201c\n\u201d: \u201calthough individual people tend to make highly error-prone predictions when lots of these estimates are averaged together, the errors have a tendency to cancel out.\u201d Hence, the prediction market will always be \u201csmarter\u201d than its constituents.\nHowever, the prediction market is not that helpful when it comes to large, strategic decisions\u2014the ones made by governments and corporations from time to time. The reason is simple: these events do not occur with high frequency.\nIf you want to be more resilient in cases such as these, you\u2019re better off planning for individual outcomes (i.e., multiple futures). But, how many outcomes should you plan for ahead?\nMore often than not, you\u2019d think that plans fail because planners\u2014 whether government planners trying to reduce global poverty or advertising planners trying to launch a new campaign for a client\u2014ignore common sense.\nBut that\u2019s what your common sense tells you to think after the fact: \u201cof course it went wrong,\u201d you say, \u201cthey didn\u2019t take into account the thing I, from the future, can see that \n \ntaken into account.\u201d\nIn fact, it\u2019s the other way around: planners fail \u201cbecause they rely on \n own common sense to reason about the behavior of people who are different from them.\u201d\nThis seems like an easy trap to avoid\u2014but, Watts says, it isn\u2019t. \n\u201cWe will always be tempted to think that we know how other people will react to a new product, or to a politician\u2019s campaign speech, or to a new tax law. \u2018It\u2019ll never work,\u2019 we will want to say, \u2018because people just don\u2019t like that kind of thing,\u2019 or \u2018No one will be fooled by his obvious chicanery,\u2019 or \u2018Such a tax will reduce incentives to work hard and invest in the economy.\u2019\u201d \nNone of this can be helped, apparently: \u201cwe cannot suppress our commonsense intuition any more than we can will our heart to stop beating.\u201d\nSo, what \n we do?\nSimple: we can remember that \u201cwhenever it comes to questions of business strategy or government policy, or even marketing campaigns and website design, we must rely \n on our common sense and \n on what we can measure.\u201d\nJust like in the prediction market: more data means better judgments. \n data means making nothing more than common sense decisions, i.e., what you would have made without any sort of data to start with.\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious what you \ndo, isn\u2019t it?\nWhat very few people tell you is that luck plays a large part in the way you\u2019re treated in society, because even our understanding about fairness and justice is profoundly dependent on the oftentimes unforeseeable outcome of some events.\nConsider this example: a driver kills four people, including an unborn child. It is later discovered that he had been drinking with his friends and that he is a police officer. Of course, he is tried and sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison.\nHe is widely criticized for his behavior, and very few people find even a single good word for him. \nThe problem?\nWell, how many times have you driven your car after a night out drinking? What if you had killed someone? \nStill, you \n and the man from the example\u2014he is real, and his name is Joseph Gray\u2014did. You\u2019re still considered an honest and good person. He, even though he has served as a police officer, is (and quite justly) not.\nThe point of this thought experiment is simple: random luck has a real and very tangible effect on our lives. Many studies (in addition to the \n) have shown that people of similar talent end up at very different levels of success, and \n.\nThat\u2019s why the debate between Nozick and Rawls about what constitutes a just society is basically pointless: they are talking about two different things.\nIn the natural world, the libertarian Nozick might be right: to everyone what he has worked for. \nHowever, we live in a society, so the liberal John Rawls is the only one who makes sense: a just society should minimize the effect of random luck on inequality.\nPeople have always longed to know things. \nAnd, in the case of some disciplines, they can be fairly sure that they \nknow them: physics and chemistry are, more or less, exact sciences, and their findings are confirmed by repeatable experiments.\nUnfortunately, sociology and anthropology, for example, are fairly different: they study man, and man is not only ever-changeable creature but a host of billions of unique personalities.\nThat\u2019s why many of the social and psychological experiments some smart people have done in the past may be just plain wrong: as the author has shown by repeating Stanley Milgram\u2019s \u201csix degrees of separation\u201d experiment, what works for 300 people may not work for 60,000. And what about 6 billion?\nFortunately, we live in a day and age where we can finally analyze data better: Twitter, Facebook, and search engine queries offer sociologists invaluable treasure trove of data and their findings because based on larger specimens, are inevitably more correct.\nWhat they have already discovered is simple: common sense answers to complex questions are, more often than not, wrong. \n\u201cJust as the invention of the telescope revolutionized the study of the heavens,\u201d concludes Watts, \u201cso too by rendering the unmeasurable measurable, the technological revolution in mobile, Web, and Internet communications has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of ourselves and how we interact.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cEverything is Obvious\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Common Sense Works in Everyday Situations\u2014But Not in Situations Which Really Matter\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We Should Uncommon Our Sense to Solve Our Problems\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Social Science Has Discovered Its Telescope\u2014and It\u2019s Something Rather Banal\nCommon Sense Works in Everyday Situations\u2014But Not in Situations Which Really Matter\nCommon sense is something you need no definition for: it\u2019s the first thing that pops into your brain in any given situation, the obvious answers to the questions of life.\nFortunately, common sense is a powerful mechanism which helps people deal with everyday problems; unfortunately, the very same mechanisms (intuition, generalizations, fast thinking) that help you safely get through your day are the reasons why economists and politicians have caused so much unnecessary suffering.\nPut simply, when it comes to important, large-scale strategic decisions which involve anticipation and prediction\u2014common sense does us many disfavors.\nWe Should Uncommon Our Sense to Solve Our Problems\nConsequently, if we want to solve serious problems, we need to use something Watts refers to as the uncommon sense, i.e., to use the things we know about the deficiencies of our common sense (which we know via social experiments) and transform them into advantages.\nThings such as the prediction market and redistribution of wealth (and other things) work\u2014but are merely the start of a long journey toward a just, resilient, future-proof society.\nSocial Science Has Discovered Its Telescope\u2014and It\u2019s Something Rather Banal\nRobert Merton\u2014the eminent social scientist, and not \n\u2014once noted that social science hasn\u2019t found its Kepler and its telescope, i.e., the tool which would revolutionize the field.\nDuncan Watts think that we\u2019ve finally happened upon it. And it\u2019s the thing you\u2019d least expect to be: social media networks, Google search queries, the cloud.\nBecause of these things, social scientists nowadays have the privilege to deal with much, much larger sets of data than their predecessors could. \nAnd that, Watts, believes, has already started a revolution.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nEverything is Obvious Quotes\nFinal Notes\n\u201cEvery once in a while,\u201d writes \n, \u201ca book comes along that forces us to re-examine what we know and how we know it.

And Why?\nAs the title suggests, \nis the decade-younger cousin of \n, which means\nif you\u2019ve read that Vaynerchuk classic and loved it, then this is where you should be heading next.\nOf course, the same applies if you\u2019ve read and liked any of Vaynerchuk\u2019s books we\u2019ve summarized here, such as \n \n, or \nPerfectly suited for young and aspiring entrepreneurs.\nCrushing It Summary\nI: Get Pumped\nIn 2009, Gary Vaynerchuk\u2014a name you\u2019re certainly already familiar with if you know anything about modern business and marketing strategies\u2014published \n.\nIts promise?\nIn the words of Vaynerchuk himself, \u201cto teach entrepreneurs how to monetize their passion by using social media to build a strong personal brand to attract customers and advertisers to their websites, as well as transform them into such trusted experts or entertainment figures that brands and outlets would pay them to talk, consult, and attend events\u201d\nIn other words, \nwas one of the very first books to suggest that \n was the time to build a strong personal brand and earn money out of your own likes and dislikes\u2014literally.\nTrue, the book never once mentioned the word \u201cinfluencer,\u201d but if the description above doesn\u2019t spell \u201cinfluencer\u201d for you, then you\u2019re not reading something correctly. \nAnd \n!\nJust a few relevant stats are more than enough to vindicate Vaynerchuk:\n\u2022YouTube\u2019s daily viewership is closing in on TV\u2019s 1.25 billion hours per day, as television viewership falls every year;\n\u2022 One in every five minutes spent on mobile is spent on Facebook\u2019s apps and services;\n\u2022 Every minute, 65,900 videos and photos are posted on Instagram.\n\u2022 Over 3 billion snaps are created each day on Snapchat, where over 60 percent of ads are watched with the audio on.\nTo put that in more practical terms, \u201ceven with only a thousand followers, an entry-level Instagrammer could earn about $5,000 per year with just two posts a week, and ten thousand followers could net almost $20,000 per year.\u201d\n\u201cWhen it comes to professional opportunities,\u201d Vaynerchuk notes, \u201cthis is the best time to be alive in the history of humankind.\u201d\nSo, what are you waiting for?\n\u201cWhile it can be hard to pinpoint why some influencers build attractive, lucrative personal brands that succeed beyond their wildest expectations,\u201d notes Vaynerchuk at the beginning of the second chapter, \u201cit\u2019s not hard to figure out why so many who attempt to do it fail.\u201d\n\u201cIn general,\u201d he goes on, \u201cit\u2019s because they\u2019re putting their energies into the wrong things. They care, but not enough about what really matters. And what really matters is a pretty short list: intent, authenticity, passion, patience, speed, work, and attention.\u201d\nLet\u2019s have a look at all of them.\nIt all starts with your intent, aka \n. In other words, before doing anything business-related, ask yourself \ndo you want to be an entrepreneur and/or why do you want to be an influencer?\nIf the answer is because of the money, then you can be sure, straight away, that you\u2019ll fail. \nWhether it\u2019s to share your knowledge or to help people, to have fun with a creative outlet or to create community, to build something that leaves a legacy or to make other people enjoy their lives more\u2014these are all great reasons to start a business.\nMaking money is not.\nSo, center your activities around these three altruistic values: a commitment to service, a desire to provide value, and a love of teaching.\nAnd Vaynerchuk promises\u2014you won\u2019t go wrong.\nYour intent will immediately be reflected in your authenticity. \nTrue, sometimes fakes start off well, but the audience is pretty great in noticing fakes and, in time, they fail.\n\u201cAuthenticity,\u201d notes justly Vaynerchuk, \u201cis a welcome relief to consumers who live in a society where they constantly feel that they\u2019re being taken advantage of or hearing only parts of the whole story.\u201d\nIf you\u2019ve watched \n, you already know that this is where not only business, but actual, authentic life begins: with passion.\nYou know why?\nBecause things will inevitably get rough. And if you don\u2019t have passion for what you\u2019re doing, when that happens, you\u2019ll probably give up.\n\u201cWe\u2019re on this earth for only a short time,\u201d writes Vaynerchuk, \u201cand the bulk of our adult days are spent at work. It\u2019s worth taking the steps necessary to make sure those hours are as rewarding, productive, and enjoyable as possible.\u201d\nHere\u2019s something they rarely tell you: the money won\u2019t start flowing right off the bat. \nOn the contrary, in fact: you\u2019ll need to put in the effort for some time, almost without the benefit of an audience or, consequently, feedback.\nAnd even when the money eventually comes, you need to invest it back in your business to make it grow.\nMany people are impatient, and they spend it straight away on watches, suits, and all kinds of flash, thus robbing themselves of the opportunity to do something better for the long term.\nDon\u2019t be one of those people: be patient.\nIt might seem strange to follow up on patience with speed, but Vaynerchuk is quick to point out that this isn\u2019t a contradiction.\nAnd that\u2019s because while patience is for the long term, speed is for the short term.\nIn other words, the world is spinning fast nowadays, so gravitate toward things that will make you more efficient and allow you to do your work faster.\nBecause, if you don\u2019t do it today, someone else will.\nYou need to be constantly in the mode, says Vaynerchuk, even if that means making a lot of mistakes.\n\u201cBeing unafraid of making mistakes makes everything easy for me,\u201d he writes, channeling his inner Wayne Gretzky. \u201cNot worrying about what people think frees you to do things, and doing things allows you to win or learn from your loss\u2014which means you win either way. Hear me now: you are better off being wrong ten times and being right three than you are if you try only three times and always get it right.\u201d\nThis lesson is so important that it\u2019s bolded in the book: when you first start out, there is no time for leisure.\nThat\u2019s why entrepreneurship is a young man\u2019s game: you need a lot of stamina to get your business and your personal brand off the ground.\nYou\u2019re never too young to start.\nAs we said above, things are changing fast today, so it\u2019s your mistake if you get too comfortable on one platform and stop developing solid skills on the others.\nYou have to pay attention to everything: trends, controversies, scandals, other influencers, and entrepreneurs.\nRemember the time when you weren\u2019t sure if you wanted to open an account on Instagram? \nWell, people were already mastering it at the time.\nThey may be millionaires today.\nSpeaking of mastering things\u2014there\u2019s apparently one you don\u2019t really need to master. And that one is the eighth thing that matters, the eighth essential: content.\nToo many people think that they\u2019ll never master editing, camera work, lighting, movements, or writing style. And that\u2019s why they never start producing content.\nHowever, that\u2019s \nhow the world of influencing works: all you need to do is keep producing high-quality content, and with high consistency.\nMuch better than waiting to master Adobe Premiere to start producing it, is to just start documenting your life, just like Vaynerchuk does (he employs a videographer who films almost everything he does, except confidential meetings and bathroom visits).\nYou know why?\nBecause when you document \n on a daily basis, you are, at the very least, an \nvoice. \nAnd that\u2019s already more than many people are.\nSocial media personality Shaun \u201cShonduras\u201d McBride has once defined entrepreneur as \u201csomeone who finds a way.\u201d \nAnd you know the other side of that coin: a failed entrepreneur is someone who finds excuses.\nThe three most common excuses people use are the following:\n\u2022 Fear of Failure\n\u2022 Fear of Wasting Time\n\u2022 Fear of Seeming Vain\nGary Vaynerchuk\u2019s three pieces of advice to tackle these three fears are, in order:\n\u2022 \u201cThere will always be people around you to tell you not to do things. You have to let yourself be your sole judge and jury.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cSchool and the nine-to-five grind are not going anywhere\u2026 People are so scared they\u2019ll be wasting time if they try to build a business, even when their time isn\u2019t valuable.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cEveryone\u2019s an ass until they\u2019re a pioneer.\u201d\nAnecdotes and success stories aside, this is almost certainly one of the shortest chapters you\u2019ll ever find.\nIt consists of just one word which answers the implied question from its title:\n.\nII: Create Your Pillar\n\u201cNo matter what kind of influencer you want to become,\u201d writes Gary Vaynerchuk straightforwardly, \u201ceveryone must start with this step: create a Facebook business page.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the very first, non-negotiable step, the cost of entry to building a personal brand.\nOnce you open a Facebook page, you need to start creating and developing breakthrough opportunities for yourself in these two manners:\n\u2022 Hashtags, \u201ca strategy that requires an unbelievably long grind\u201d;\n\u2022 Direct-messaging, i.e., \u201creaching out directly to people and offering something of value in return for their attention, a strategy that requires an unbelievably long grind.\u201d\nAs you can see, the keywords are \u201cunbelievably long grind.\u201d\nIn most cases, that means years\u2014not months\u2014before you get discovered.\n\u201cIf that bothers you,\u201d says, Vaynerchuk, \u201cclose the book.\u201d\nIf that\u2019s not the case, then on the following pages of it\u2014basically, the second half of the book\u2014you\u2019ll be able to Vaynerchuk\u2019s reviews and 101 intros to the major social platforms in existence.\nSince the time the book was published, Musical.ly was bought by TikTok, and that\u2019s the name under which it is famous now.\nFamous, you say? How come I\u2019ve never heard of it?\nWell, that\u2019s because you\u2019re not aged between seven and seventeen.\nIf you were, then you would have been one of the hundreds of millions of pre-teens and teens who regularly use this platform to share very short videos.\nIn fact, 1 of 6 teenagers is most excited about musical.ly\u2014not Twitter, not Facebook, not Instagram or Snapchat.\nBest suited for entertainers, musical.ly is the way to go if you are a comedian, dancer, or a singer.\nSo, what are you waiting for: the time is ticking\u2026 tik-tok, tik-tok\u2026\nGary is pretty big into Snapchat, and he believes that this is one of the most underestimated mediums available for building a personal brand.\nAfter all, it only should be\u2014with about 200 million active daily users!\nBut there\u2019s one more reason Gary likes Snapchat so much: it is where you can be an authentic human being. \nUnlike the unreal photos shared on Instagram, Snapchat stories are unedited and unshareable\u2014but that\u2019s what makes them attractive.\nTrue, it may be tricky for marketers to build a brand with no hashtags and with self-destructing content. \nBut not making quick sales is a small price to pay for showing your rawest and unfiltered true self to your audience. \nRemember: authenticity always wins people.\nAnd it is people who make sales.\nHands down, Gary has the best definition of Twitter we\u2019ve ever read:\n\u201cTwitter is the water cooler of society, that place where everyone goes to get the latest update on whatever news or pop-culture event is occurring. The only difference is that, while office workers used to have to wait until the day after an event to gather around and share their knowledge and opinions, now that conversation is happening in real time, 24/7.\u201d\nConsequently, Twitter is all about two of the seven essentials: speed and attention.\nSo, catch the latest trends and stories and use the \n to get ahead in the game.\nAs we\u2019ve already mentioned in our summary of the first chapter, TV\u2019s got nothing on YouTube, the video platform so big you should not even think about ignoring.\nOn the contrary: just start using it!\nOf course, you may think that you\u2019re not interesting and that you\u2019ve got no video skills whatsoever, but, as we said above, that is beside the point.\nYouTube is so big you\u2019ll definitely find some kind of audience, no matter how specific your niche is.\nJust think of it this way: there are videos with over half a million views which document nothing but garage sales! \nWhat\u2019s so interesting about them? you ask.\nExactly.\nSo, start documenting your life and your passions. And upload your videos on YouTube. If nobody discovers them\u2014then, you\u2019ve got nothing to be ashamed about. If someone does\u2014then you\u2019ve got a potential subscriber.\nAs we said above, creating a Facebook page is the first thing you should do before starting any kind of business.\nIgnore all those people who are saying that Facebook is \nanymore: people have been saying that for years, and the last time we checked, Facebook was still one of the most visited sites on the Internet.\nAnd the best thing about it: there\u2019s no better platform to target your audience than Facebook. This is true even if you have a small budget.\nWe\u2019ve already summarized many Facebook-marketing-related books (such as \n and \n), so\u2014once again\u2014what are you waiting for? \nStart doing something.\nThere\u2019s no better way to connect with other influencers than Instagram. \nYou know why?\nThree reasons: 1) it\u2019s the young people\u2019s network; 2) it\u2019s where the influencers are mostly; and 3) it\u2019s where you can send them a private message.\nInstagram may seem \n polished, but we\u2019ve never heard people complaining that there\u2019s too much beauty or too much sun on those Instagram photos.\nPlus: there\u2019s no other platform where an egg is the most liked photo of all times, is there?\nPeople nowadays are just too busy to read or watch films when they have time. Because, well, they never do: most of the time they\u2019re doing something else.\nAnd if that something else means riding the bus or the subway, then it feels like time lost.\nThus, the basis of the podcasts appeal.\nWhy reading this summary when you can listen to it from start to finish on the go?\nIf that feels like a rhetorical question, then you know what to do: start a podcast.\nFor introverted people, podcasts are better than YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram combined: you never have to show your face and, yet, build an audience of thousands or even tens of thousands.\nIf you are shy and afraid that the podcast market is crowded today, then there\u2019s an even better way to communicate with your audience: voice-first content delivered through digital assistants such as Google\u2019s Assistant or Amazon\u2019s Alexa.\nGary says that voice-first is the future of interaction.

And Why?\nWhether you are a student with a high IQ or a parent of a child who is bored during most of its classes because it knows much more than his/her peers, you\u2019ve probably already asked yourself if traditional education is the only way.\nPeter Hollins is here to tell you that not only is it not\u2014as proven by thousands of autodidacts who\u2019ve changed our world, self-learning is a far better way. Especially today, in the era of Google and YouTube.\nShort, enjoyable, and coherent, \nis a great book for anyone who wants to become an autodidact, as well as for parents who want to inspire curiosity in their children.\u00a0\nAbout Peter Hollins\n is a dedicated student of the human nature and a bestselling author.\nA psychologist by trade, Hollins started writing books to reach a wider audience and help more people than what his private practice allowed.\nSince then, he has written numerous books, \nand \nthe two most celebrated among them.\nIf you want, you can find out more at \n.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Science of Self-Learning PDF Summary\u201d\nBefore technology made acquiring information super-easy, there were not many ways to do that: the classroom, the laboratory, the workshop, and, sometimes, out in the field.\u00a0\nEither way, if you wanted to learn something, it required a lot of effort.\nNowadays, you can google absolutely anything you want and find out very specific info about your subject of interest in less than a few seconds\u2014no matter where you are or what you are doing.\u00a0\nYou have not only Wikipedia in your pocket, but the sum of all knowledge available to humans: thought-provoking videos, \n presentations, in-depth reviews, interesting analyses, captivating book summaries\u2026 everything!\nAnd just until three or four decades ago, the only way you could look up for general info was inside an encyclopedia! And it was even more difficult than just opening a book!\nFirst of all, encyclopedias that really mattered were not 300 pages long but spanned for more than twenty or thirty volumes. Consequently, very few people could afford them. So, you needed to go to the library and look for information there. And God forbid it was something recent: you could never find the title of Taylor Swift\u2019s first album in \n!\n\u201cIt almost feels like the dark ages when you realize how difficult it was to simply acquire knowledge and learn about what you\u2019re interested in,\u201d writes Peter Hollins at the beginning of \n.\nLess than 200 pages long and printed with quite a large font, Hollins\u2019 book may seem like something assembled rather quickly, but don\u2019t be fooled: there is a lot you can take away from \n.\nAnd some of it can help you a lot along your way to mastery and greatness.\nSee for yourself!\nThe Principles and History of Self-Learning\nYou didn\u2019t need the comparison above to know that the process of acquiring information has changed significantly over the last few decades. What hasn\u2019t changed, however (even though \n) is the educational system: it is still based on the traditional top-down learning model.\nThe problem?\nIn a traditional environment, you still learn what somebody else has decided that you should beforehand, be it your family, your private instructor, or, in most cases, a school board.\nNot all of the aspects of these systems are negative, but many people have expressed the \n of the traditional learning model, long before the advent of the Internet. Some of these guys you know quite well: Mark Twain, Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin.\nIn one way or another, these three were all autodidacts, i.e., people who were fully or partially self-taught in the arts and sciences they eventually mastered. A sort of Will Huntings of their days.\u00a0\nYou\u2019d be surprised how many of your favorite authors (\n, Borges, \n, Tagore), musicians (Bowie, Cobain, Hendrix), directors (Tarantino, Kubrick, Welles), and even inventors (Da Vinci, Tesla) were just that: curious people who learned all that they learned by themselves.\nThat is the essence of being an autodidact or a self-educator, both a teacher and a student at the same time.\u00a0\nAs you can see, self-learning is not a new pursuit. However, what\u2019s new is how possible and attainable it is nowadays. \u201cCourtesy of the Internet, the world is your oyster,\u201d writes Hollins, \u201cand we have the ability to learn anything we want these days.\u201d\nSo that we can achieve this, first we must take a cue from the autodidacts of the past and understand the different mindset which makes self-learning possible.\nThe Learning Success Pyramid\nTo sum up, traditional learning is nothing more but a combination of reading and regurgitation. Self-learning is something more: a process of self-directed growth via profound intellectual curiosity.\nUnderstandably, however, self-learning isn\u2019t a mode operated by a switch that you can just flick on. Before you start educating yourself, you need to \u201cput some mental and emotional groundwork in place to prepare for success.\u201d\nLegendary college basketball coach \n can help you with that. His \u201cpyramid of success\u201d brilliantly structures the 15 stages (or blocks) one needs to pass on the course to success in his/her personal and practical ventures.\nEducator Susan Kruger used Wooden\u2019s pyramid as the foundation for something much more relevant in our case: \n. Much like Wooden\u2019s diagram, Kruger\u2019s pyramid identifies \u201cthe necessary elements one must bring to ensure accomplishment in learning throughout their life.\u201d Unlike Wooden, Kruger kept the number of blocks to 3:\n\u2022 Confidence\n\u2022 Self-management\n\u2022 Learning\nThis is how Hollins sums up the descriptions of these three stages:\nRelated to Kruger\u2019s second block (self-management) is another essential prerequisite of self-learning: self-motivation. Since you are both a teacher and a student, without it, you won\u2019t be able to move forward through your life.\n, Hollins reminds us that there are three main aspects of self-motivation: autonomy, mastery, and purpose/impact. \u201cThe intangibles,\u201d says Hollins, \u201ctend to be far more powerful than what you would traditionally consider motivating.\u201d\nInteraction and Information\nNow that you know the basics of self-learning, it\u2019s time that Hollins shares with you a few techniques to help you on your journey to mastery.\u00a0\nLearn them, and use them as often as you can, and you\u2019ll be able to get the most out of anything you read, hear, or see.\nIntroduced by American educational philosopher and psychologist Francis P. Robinson in his 1948 book \n\u00b8 the SQ3R method is one of the most powerful tools in a self-learner toolkit.\nDeveloped specifically with comprehension in mind, the SQ3R method makes reading and observing a much more active process, creating dynamic engagements between readers and books which allow for the information acquired to get stuck in a reader\u2019s mind.\nThe name of the technique is an acronym of its five components: \n. Let\u2019s have a look at all of them\nThe first step in the SQ3R method aims to help you get a general overview of what you \n be reading. We italicized the \u201cwill\u201d for a reason: as tempting as it is, don\u2019t start reading before you survey your reading material.\u00a0\nThis step shouldn\u2019t take long: 3 to 5 minutes is all it should take you to go through the contents of a single book and take note of the headings and the sub-headings.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like taking a look at the entire map before you set off on a road trip,\u201d writes Hollins smartly. \u201cYou may not need all the knowledge at the moment, but understanding everything as a whole and how it fits together will help you with the small details and when you\u2019re in the weeds.\u201d\nEven in the second stage of the SQ3R method, \u201cyou\u2019re still not diving into the deep end.\u201d As suggested by its name, this stage is reserved for inquiries and questions.\u00a0\nWhat kind of questions?\nSimple, general. You can just ask yourself, \u201cWhat this chapter is about?\u201d or convert the titles of the headings into questions: \u201cWho is Peter Hollins?\u201d Once again, this is a short 3-to-5-minutes stage, but it is essential: it is through these questions that you\u2019re waking up your curiosity, an autodidact\u2019s best trait.\nNow you can begin reading\u2014and reading actively. You\u2019re not just reading something distant at this point, but you\u2019re treading familiar ground, trying to find answers to the questions you posed in #2. There\u2019s a big difference: you\u2019ve just turned your reading from passive into active.\nThe only way you\u2019d know if you have actually remembered something of the things you\u2019ve read is if you test yourself. See how much of what you\u2019ve read you can retrieve from memory. Try to answer the questions posited in #2.\nIt is of vital importance that you formulate and conceptualize the learned material in your very own words. Act as if you\u2019re a teacher standing in front of a group of children, if it helps.\u00a0\nThe final stage of the SQ3R method is reviewing. It is a variant of retrieving: saying back to yourself what the point of a passage, a page, or a chapter was.\nBertrand Russell claims that there is not a big difference between reading without taking notes, and not reading.\nSo, if you are one of those who don\u2019t want to put any marks on the margin of a page, try to change that about yourself immediately: this may be the reason why you\u2019re never able to remember the things you\u2019ve read.\nFortunately, however, most of us \n take notes when reading; unfortunately, it seems that very few take them in the right manner.\nDevised by Walter Pauk, an education professor at Cornell, the Cornell note-taking system has been scientifically proven to work wonders in terms of efficiency, tidiness, and memorization. And you need nothing more than a reorganization of \nyou take the notes.\nAnd it is quite simple: you just divide the list into two unequal columns (the right one about twice the size of the left one) and leave about 2 inches (5 cm) at the bottom of the page.\nNow, in the right column, you put the notes, in the left you put the keywords related to the notes, and in the space on the bottom, a summary of what you\u2019ve learned.\nIn case you have problems visualizing this, here\u2019s a short video to help you better understand what Cornell Notes are:\nRead Faster and Retain More\nIn the third part of his book, Peter Hollins demonstrates some simple\u2014but very effective\u2014speed-reading tactics, which we can sum up in four actionable pieces of advice:\n\u2022 \n. The obvious and self-explanatory one. Subvocalizing is defocusing and slows you quite a bit. If you are doing it, it\u2019s time you stopped;\n\u2022 \n. \n, you\u2019ve got to train yourself to read faster. And the best part of your body to start training is your eyes: the less they slide away from the page, the faster you\u2019ll be able to read.\u00a0\n\u2022 \n. Slow readers read linearly, but fast readers read diagonally. Learn to strategically skim the pages where the main topics are merely introduced, or some marginals topics are discussed.\n\u2022 \n.\u00a0\nHowever, Peter Hollins is adamant that speed-reading is not enough (or even the right way to go). If you want to retain more and actually grow as a self-learner, you need to learn how to read properly, regardless of your speed.\u00a0\nHe shares nothing new here\u2014he merely advises his readers to buy that brilliant Mortimer & Adler classic, \n\u2014and reminds us of the four levels of reading:\n\u2022 \n: how you probably read right now;\n\u2022 \n: when you start wondering what it is precisely what you\u2019re reading;\n\u2022 \n: when you start taking Cornell notes;\n\u2022 \n: when you start comparing the acquired information with other books on the same topic.\nThe difference between traditional and self-learning is basically the difference between the first and the other three levels of reading; becoming an autodidact is all about becoming a syntopical reader.\nAfter all, at school, nobody teaches you to start asking questions about what you\u2019re reading: if anything, they teach you the opposite. Autodidacts don\u2019t think that way: they actively search for meaning\u2014both in the texts they read, and, more importantly, in the lives they lead.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Science of Self-Learning\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Traditional Learning is an Outdated Model\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Self-Learning Is Not a New Concept\u2014But It Is Made for Our Times\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Use the SQ3R and Cornell Notes Method to Read and Retain Better\nTraditional Learning is an Outdated Model\nNow, don\u2019t get us wrong: learning in a classroom comes with a lot of benefits. The problem is this traditional learning model has negatives as well, some of them even quite obvious.\nFor example, in traditional learning, you\u2019ll always learn what somebody else somewhere (your family, your private tutor, a school board) has decided is best for you to know.\nIn addition, traditional learning is psychologically restrictive, since instead of arousing, it stifles curiosity in children, who are specifically taught \nto question what they are required to learn.\nSelf-Learning Is Not a New Concept\u2014But It Is Made for Our Times\nNot only due to the reasons pointed out above, self-learning has been advocated by great minds ever since the Renaissance.\u00a0\nIn self-learning, you are your own teacher and student: it is you who makes the syllabus and you who must adhere to it, you who make and grade the tests.\nDa Vinci, Tesla, Hesse, Twain\u2014these were all autodidacts or self-learners, meaning, they all managed to excel in the field of their choice without a teacher. And they did it at a time when there was no Wikipedia and no YouTube.\nIf it ever made sense for people to become self-learners, now is that time. In other words, if you are using all these modern technological benefits to instead of exploring the world around you\u2014then you\u2019re missing out on quite a lot!\nUse the SQ3R and Cornell Notes Method to Read and Retain Better\nThough quite simple, the SQ3R method and the Cornell note-taking system should help you read better and remember things longer.\nSQ3R stands for survey, question, read, retrieve, review\u2014which is how you should approach every single book you\u2019ll ever read. You should also use the Cornell note-taking system to organize your knowledge better while you acquire it.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Science of Self-Learning Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\n\u201cNever judge a book by its cover\u201d may be a clich\u00e9, but \nis living proof why it is worth repeating clich\u00e9s from time to time.\nThough quite unappealingly designed \n, this book offers just enough to get you on track to becoming an autodidact, and, more importantly, isn\u2019t shy at all to reveal many of its sources.\nIf you are not a fan of traditional education, here\u2019s a great place to start your research into the art and science of self-learning."},

And Why?\nWestern democracy must meet head-on an increase in censorship and government regulations. The United States of America, a name that echoes liberty and individual responsibility, has been ridiculed by a collective-driven mob.\n\u201c\n\u201d intends to unravel the reasons behind this surge of bias and ideologically possessed journalism.\nWith this in mind, I believe that this book is suited for anyone living in Western countries, as it will help them understand what is at stake. \nAbout Mark R. Levin\nApart from being an author, \n is a lawyer, radio personality and former chief of staff for Attorney General Edwin Meese. \nAfter winning the Republican Nomination, Mark became a Pro-Trump supporter and a fierce critic of the \n in US elections.\n\u201cUnfreedom of the Press PDF Summary\u201d\nThe book title in itself reveals the main topic that troubles many people in the new age of digital monitoring. \nThe US, having the most influence in today\u2019s politics, is hit by a wave of authoritarianism, often disguised as progressivism.\nThe pseudo-intellectuals supported by the \u201cprogressive\u201d left, sit at the center of this debate, and act as partisans to the Democratic Party.\nWhat is most surprising, not only to Americans but also to people who visit the US is the hostility propelled by the journalists, which is aimed at America\u2019s founding principles of democracy, integrity, and freedom.\nIt seems like the concept of freedom is slowly fading away, and more authoritative political fractions are coming to light.\nEven though it is the media\u2019s job to condemn these acts of tyranny, the so-called \u201cunbiased\u201d journalists, set on a different campaign that has an agenda attached to it.\nOne might make the argument that the genuine bedrock of democracy is the freedom of the press, and yet it is the government that has the final say.\nThe media is unable to enact policies which will keep the government out, or perhaps they don\u2019t want to. They blatantly cater to big corporations and advocate for big government that is in direct confrontation with America\u2019s founding principles.\nLet\u2019s unpack the focal point of this discussion by asking a couple of questions.\nTo understand the overly polarized America, you have to be aware of the fact that only 21% of Republicans trust the media, while 80% of Democrats feel the same way.\nTrump\u2019s attacks on big News Networks has increased since he has been in the office, because he feels the media portrays his administration as inept and racist, at every opportunity.\nLara Logan (CBS News journalist and war correspondent) called out a handful of journalists who have abandoned the concept of reporting facts and are merely pushing a political agenda. \nA prodigious amount of research has been done by the nonpartisan Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Shorenstein Center on Media on the issue of news coverage during and after the elections. When it comes to Donald Trump, he received negative critics by a ratio of 13-1, while Fox is the only news outlet that didn\u2019t chastise him on an occasional basis. \nTrump lashes out at the mainstream news networks such as CBS, CNN, NBC, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post for this level of bias against him.\nOn Fox News, 52% of all stories reported about Trump had a negative mark, while 48% had a clear positive tone.\nIt might seem shocking to you, but the so-called \u201cunbiased\u201d networks often portray Fox News as incompetent, highly unprofessional, and extremely biased. They even go as far as outright banning certain shows and hosts in an attempt to destroy their reputation.\nBy comparison, former US President, Barack Obama enjoyed far more positive media coverage in the first 100 days of his presidency than any of its predecessors.\nIt is estimated that approximately 40% of all news stories related to Barack Obama had a positive tone, compared to 22% for President George W. Bush and 27% for Bill Clinton.\nBut, \n in order to understand how the press has evolved.\nIn the late 18\n century, years following the declaration of independence, the United States entered a party-press era.\nIt was a time when newspapers openly aligned to a political party, an organization or a politician. If you consider that undemocratic, wait until you hear what is going on now.\nOn January 18\n, 2018, Andrew Malcolm summed up political journalism in the United States as anti-Trump \u2013 a statement that only further divided the country.\nThe targeted media outlets deny the existence of bias against the 45\n President of the USA by simply referring to their negative reports as being realistic and comprehensive. \nUnfortunately, nobody could find the same level of criticism aimed at the presidency of Obama, while he was in office. Literally, no journalist has called out Barack Obama on his infamous statements that Al Qaeda was on the run, that the Russians are not a strategic threat, that his administration hasn\u2019t experienced a \n during his time at the White House, etc.\nIt seems as if any person out there willing to denounce, condemn, or chastise President Trump is immediately given a platform to spread information, often coupled with inaccuracies.\nImpeachment is another hot topic in 2018 and 2019. The press took the bait and reacted in the same way Democrat Senators, politicians, and officials did. \nYou can also see a carefully selected list of guests and people that portray themselves as \u201cexperts\u201d in the mattering question. \nYou don\u2019t even need anything other than to turn on the TV and lay witness to the orchestrated attack on Trump, as he is labeled a racist, Nazi, among other things. The so-called geopolitical pundits, news anchors, and others have openly put him in the same category as Stalin, Mao, and Hitler. \nBeing associated with the biggest mass murderers in history that wiped out more than 130 million people from the face of this planet, is unspeakably offensive to the families who have been on the receiving end of these executions in the past century.\nEven though this kind of revelation will give goosebumps to a normal person, the media outrage and the hysterical outcry on the left increases as the 2020 Presidential Elections loom.\nSo, it gets pretty clear that the term \u201cFreedom of the Press\u201d has become corrupt to its very core.\nWhen someone is talking about it, the usual reaction revolves around the concept of keeping Government control out of what people consume on a daily basis, and make their own arguments.\nBut, today\u2019s media asserts that Trump labeling them as \u201cThe enemy of the people\u201d or \u201cFake News\u201d is not only a menace to the Freedom of the Press but also a direct attack on the First Amendment.\nThe question is? Has Trump advocated for a state-run media?\nDoes the media support his policies? Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you know that the answer is almost always \u201cNO\u201d with capital letters.\nIf you take for example cable channels, (CNN, Fox News, MSNBC) you\u2019ll find that Obama hovered around 3-5% airtime throughout his presidency, while the number for Trump up to this point varies between 13-17%. \nOn top of that, you can add that the coverage during his first 100 days of his presidency was overwhelmingly negative. This shows why 51% of Republicans believe that today\u2019s media is rightfully labeled as \u201cThe enemy of the people.\u201d\nTo better illustrate this, Mark R. Levin recounts on the policies implemented and enacted by the 28\n President of the United States Woodrow Wilson, and the 32\n Franklin D. Roosevelt. \nDuring WW1, President Woodrow Wilson revamped the Espionage Act and imprisoned hundreds of Americans who opposed the war. He restricted the Freedom of the Press, and basically threatened one of the main pillars of US democracy.\nIn the case of Franklin D. Roosevelt, he was able to find common grounds with the media and the correspondents. Of course, there were some problems, like threats and pressure, but the media is indebted to Roosevelt and his administration for many things that are related to the idea of freedom of the press.\nThe same accomplishments can also be attributed to Barrack Obama for being able to maintain this relatively open relationship with the Press. \nBut many wonder \u2013 why Donald Trump is smeared by the media, and will that be a reason enough for imposing restrictions on the \n. The answer is, \u201cNo.\u201d\nThere are no orders, executives, nor acts signed or enacted by Donald Trump\u2019s administration that will ultimately lead to Curtailment of the First Amendment. \nHowever, you cannot help but notice that there is all-out warfare between Trump and certain media outlets. Obviously, those leaning on the left.\nMark R. Levin also criticizes the New York Times, because of the way they are handling the process of conveying information and how often they put the journalist\u2019s personal point of view on the pedestal. As a journalist, you should start with a fact, statistic or something that upholds your claim, and move on from there.\nIs there an upheaval in sight?

And Why?\nSeth Godin says that \u201cthis should be the next book you read. Urgent, leveraged, and useful, it will change your business like nothing else.\u201d And who are we to argue?\nHeed to Godin\u2019s advice especially if you are a marketing strategist, an entrepreneur, or a business owner.\nThe Fortune Cookie Principle Summary\nEven a four-year-old entrepreneur with her first lemonade stand knows the one, basic truth about business: \n. \nIn other words, just setting out your stall is not enough.\nAnd yet, writes Bernadette Jiwa, that\u2019s exactly what most of us do in business. \n\u201cWe take our idea, our product, our innovation,\u201d she writes, \u201cand \n people to pay attention to it. We try to change what people think (using the facts), so that we can change what they do (buy our products and services).\u201d\nHowever, today, people have way more choices than they actually need, giving them one luxury, our ancestors never had: they can simply \n the things they don\u2019t care about. \n\u201cChanging how people think and getting them to act isn\u2019t so easy anymore,\u201d concludes Jiwa.\nThat\u2019s where \ncomes in. Using a plethora of well-known examples, the book reveals \n the key to building a great business is devising a great brand story\u2014and then proceeds to explain \nyou can write it yourself by focusing on the 20 most important keywords.\nNew Marketing: A Recap\nAccording to Brian Solis, only 71 of the companies placed on the original \nlist compiled in 1955 remain there today.\nThe reason?\n, the rules of the game of marketing changed in the meantime, and only the ones who really bothered realizing this are still in it.\nAt the beginning of her book, Jiwa offers a quick recap of what you need to know\u2014aimed at the ones \u201cout of the loop:\u201d\n\u2022 \n. We\u2019re living in the opt-in age now, i.e., people can ignore everything that comes their way simply by changing channels, scrolling or installing an Adblocker. \u201cIn theory,\u201d Jiwa says, \u201cpeople are easier to reach, but in fact, they are harder to engage.\u201d\n\u2022 \n. \u201cA double-page spread in the weekend newspaper is not marketing,\u201d reminds Jiwa her readers. \u201cA promoted tweet is not marketing. A billboard at the train station is not marketing.\u201d\n\u2022 \n. There was a time when it was enough to say, \u201cWe invented this; now let\u2019s hire someone to find a way to sell it.\u201d That time is long past. \n\u2022 \n. Instead of being just tacked on at the end, marketing is an organic part of what you do, aligned with your mission, objective, and values. \n\u2022 \n. Just think of it this way: Kodak filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2012. Even though, for generations of people, saying \u201cKodak\u201d was practically synonymous with saying \u201ca camera,\u201d just like saying \u201cGoogle\u201d is today synonymous with Internet searching. Modern marketing is dynamic\u2014and it\u2019s more than marketing.\nThe Fortune Cookie Principle\nNot that long ago, \n of why some companies work, and others don\u2019t.\nNamely, the former don\u2019t sell commodities (\n), neither the way these commodities are made (\n), but they sell stories (\n).\nWell, that\u2019s the basis of what Bernadette Jiwa calls \u201cThe Fortune Cookie Principle.\u201d\nEvery idea, she says, every innovation, every product, and service has two elements: the cookie and the fortune.\nThe cookie, in this analogy, is the commodity, the utility, the tangible product. The cookie is the thing you put in the shop window, and it has a fixed value. The cookie is the \n.\nThen, there\u2019s also the fortune, \u201cthe magical, intangible part of the product or service, which is where the real value lies in the hearts and minds of the customer.\u201d\n\u201cThe fortune is the story,\u201d Jiwa explains, \u201cthe thing that makes people feel something. The real reason they buy the product in the first place. It\u2019s your purpose, your vision and values manifested. It\u2019s also the customers\u2019 story and worldview reflected back to them. The fortune gives the product an acquired value or a different perceived value.\u201d\nIn short, the fortune is the \n.\nYou already know where Jiwa is heading.\nPeople don\u2019t buy fortune cookies because they taste better than other cookies: they buy them because of the delight they offer at the end of the meal.\nThat\u2019s why, if you want to build a great company, baking a good cookie is merely the beginning: you need to focus most of your energy on something else, something far more important\u2014creating a better fortune. \nThe Story Is Your Advantage (Building a Brand vs. Selling a Commodity)\n\u201cGreat brands are the ones that tell the best stories,\u201d said once Jason Fried, the co-founder of Basecamp, practically summing up the section above. \u201cSure, good products and service matter, but stories are what connect people with companies.\u201d\nBernadette Jiwa has a better way of making this more comprehensible to her readers: via two very simple mathematical equations:\n\u2022 PRODUCT \u2013 MEANING = COMMODITY\n\u2022 PRODUCT + MEANING = BRAND\nIn other words, the difference between a brand and a commodity is quite straightforward: the story. Because, after all, stories are how you attach meaning and significance to anything, and businesses are not an exception.\nIt is a scary and somewhat painful truth, but it is the truth nevertheless: \u201cthe product with the most features and benefits doesn\u2019t always win.\u201d\nJiwa knows that this is the opposite of what you\u2019ve learned at school, but that doesn\u2019t mean that she isn\u2019t right.\nThink about this way: the students with the best grades usually don\u2019t get the best jobs and almost certainly don\u2019t have the best lives. (We know quite a few examples, and we\u2019re pretty sure that you know at least a few similar ones as well).\nFor better or for worse, every single day, people who are simply \u201cgood enough\u201d succeed in life. And the main reason why is: well, they are capable of telling a better story.\nThe conclusion?\nIt\u2019s not the commodity you sell\u2014its quality, its price, or its distribution\u2014that is your competitive advantage; it is the story: the story is your advantage.\nWhat Is a Brand Story?\n\u201cA brand story is more than a narrative,\u201d writes Bernadette Jiwa. \n\u201cThe story goes beyond the copy on a website, the text in a brochure, or the presentation used to pitch to investors. Your story isn\u2019t just what you tell people. It\u2019s what they believe about you based on the signals your brand sends. The story is a complete picture made up of facts, feelings, and interpretations, which means that part of your story isn\u2019t even told by you.\u201d\nIn other words, everything you do\u2014from your staff to the packaging to the way you communicate with your customers\u2014is part of your brand story. Gone are the days when a brand story was just a catchy tagline on a billboard\u2014a brand story today is the foundation of a business, a foolproof strategy for future growth.\nOne more thing, though: a brand story is also \n what merely gets you to be top-of-mind; it is what gets you to be close-to-heart.\nIt is the \n that a brand generates which have the potential to differentiate one brand from another, for the simple reason that consumers can \n \n to a limited number of brands.\nIf you don\u2019t believe Jiwa, just make a quick mental comparison between Microsoft and Apple.\nWhich one is the top-of-mind brand? And which one is the close-to-heart?\nYou know the reason.\nThe Twenty Keys to a Great Brand Story\nAccording to its author, the\n\u201cFortune Cookie Principle\u201d is \u201cthe foundation upon which you can differentiate your brand and make emotional connections with the kind of clients and customers you want to serve.\u201d\nIt is, in more theoretical terms, \u201ca brand-building framework and communication strategy consisting of twenty keys that enable you to begin telling your brand\u2019s story from the inside out.\u201d\nAnd these are the twenty keys:\nThe truth, in the meaning Jiwa uses it, is not just a \u201ccollection of facts, figures, and nutritional values that are printed on your packaging.\u201d It is a \u201creal understanding of the business you\u2019re in.\u201d \nAnd this, in Jiwa\u2019s words, \u201coften has less to do with the product you are selling or the service you are providing and more to do with the feelings your brand elicits.\u201d\nSo, ask yourself: what business are you \nin? What do your customers want from you, and \n do they want to feel? \nRemember: you\u2019re not selling a 32MB music player, but 1,000 songs in a pocket. And you are not selling cars, but excitement (Porsche) or safety (Volvo).\nThis is the \n: why are you in business? If it is to make money, then chances are you\u2019ll never build a great brand. \nYou are in the business because you can do something nobody else can, like satisfying everyone\u2019s curiosity (Google) or delivering razors by mail (Dollar Shave Club).\nShare your purpose and make sure that you stay true to it.\nWhat effect will your business have on the future? What happens \n you exist? How can you support this vision in the day-to-day running of your business? How will the changes your business brings about change how your customers feel and then act?\nYour vision is always about change: whether it\u2019s a tiny part of the world, or the world entire, you can\u2019t build a brand if you don\u2019t want to make the future a better place for at least someone (that is not you).\nValues are the answer to the question, \u201cWhat do you believe?\u201d Make a list\u2014there are no right or wrong answers. \nAnd once you make it, ask yourself this: How are you demonstrating your beliefs to the world and to your customers? Do your values come across in the service you deliver and the tone you use in your content?\nIf vision is about the future, values are about the present: how is the world better for you being here?\nAs we noted above, a product or a service without meaning is a commodity. To make it something more, tell the story of how your idea came to be and why it matters, i.e., why does the world \nyour product or service.\nUse your story to differentiate your product from your competitors.\nIf you hire just for skills, you\u2019re not hiring well enough: after all, Werner von Braun was one of the greatest scientists in history, but he was a Nazi. If NASA had hired him today, it would have been boycotted by just about everybody.\nWho you hire and what he or she stands for is very important. Your people must fit in your story; otherwise, they are not your people.\nWhat are you really selling? How are you least like the competition? Why would customers cross the street to buy from you? How does opening and using your product or experiencing your service make your customers feel?\nThese are the questions Jiwa wants you to ask yourself to realize the value you deliver. It has little to do with price and a lot to do with convenience, time, shortcuts, etc.\nAs you know full well, a great name changes the game. \n? Would they have grown into one of the greatest companies in the world without \n?\nProbably not.\nIt\u2019s your turn.\nNowadays, if you\u2019re not original, then probably you\u2019re just a little more than nobody. More than anything, that applies to your content and copy\u2014your words, your voice, your megaphone directed at your audience.\nA great way to realize if you\u2019re original is to ask yourself this simple question: \u201cCould you remove the logo from your website or marketing materials and substitute it with a competitor\u2019s logo?\u201d\nIf the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d then change \n.\nNowadays, everything is designed. So, just like with your content and copy, you need to do something to stand out.\nIf an image is worth a thousand words, then your design can make people feel emotionally attached to your product even more than your words can.\nSo, \u201cask yourself what does your design (colors, logo, packaging) communicate about your brand?\u201d and sync this answer to your story.\nAs we said above, a brand story is much more than a name and a tagline. In the 21\n century, it\u2019s also much more than design, content and copy, commodities and services\u2026 It\u2019s \n everything you do.\nJust think about it this way: would you buy something from a vegan company whose owner and employees are noticed celebrating something at McDonald\u2019s?\nCustomer experience encompasses everything that happens when people encounter your brand. It\u2019s already outside of your territory\u2014but it doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t do something to guide it.\nAsk yourself what kind of experience you want to deliver to your customers and then start thinking about how to deliver it.\nIf you make your customers feel nice\u2014they will share this feeling with others. They will share \nfeelings, in fact, so be careful.\nNow, customers use markers to detect what kind of audience you want to attract; price and quality are two of the most immediate markers.\nIf you want to communicate luxury with your story, then it\u2019s wrong to be cheaper than your competitors (think Jimmy Choo). If, however, you want to communicate affordability, then your \nis to be as cheap as possible.\nOf course, the price goes hand in hand with quality: it\u2019s pointless to be more expensive than your competitors if you don\u2019t offer quality for the money, isn\u2019t it?\nLet us ask you once again: how are you \n like the competition? Build your story around this because that\u2019s how you can differentiate from your competitors. \nYou want your customers to perceive your product as something unique and to associate it with something grander and more universal.\nFor example, Vespa is a symbol of freedom\u2014and it sells because of this perception.\nWe mentioned Dollar Shave Club above and here\u2019s a chance to mention it once again. Their razors are nothing new; their distribution (via subscription and mail) \n.\nThat\u2019s what you want as well: sending a signal to your customers about your brand through your distribution model.\nOne mistake you should avoid at all costs is the middleman: our century is the century of networking and direct relationships.\nThe more personal you get, the more customers you find.\nGoogle wanted to open a branch in Berlin, but Berliners are famously anti-establishment and anti-corporation oriented. Because of this\u2014and because of quite a few protests\u2014Google had to back off.\nDon\u2019t make the same mistake when choosing the location for your business: even your locations should fit in with your story.\nAn upmarket boutique won\u2019t thrive in an area with high unemployment, and it would probably not be a good idea to sell affordability in Silicon Valley.\nThere are two ways to succeed: either you\u2019ll appeal to the masses, or you\u2019ll appeal to a group of people with a particular worldview.\nIn the first case, you want to make people feel as if they are part of the crowd; in the second case, you want to make them feel the opposite: as if they are unique.\nWhatever you do, however, be consistent: you\u2019ll probably trip if you want to make the leap from ubiquity to scarcity or vice versa.\nOf course, there\u2019s nothing that a good story won\u2019t cover\u2014but you better have one already prepared. \nYour brand is defined not only by your story but also by the people buying that story. \n\u201cLEGO fans, the LEGO community. They define what LEGO is all about,\u201d says J\u00f8rgen Vig Knudstorp, knowing full well that LEGO is bigger than it is simply because the people who buy it participate in its story.\nThe greatest of all brand stories are the ones shared by a company\u2019s customers. Think about what you can add to your story to inspire your customers to become a community.\nAs you probably know from experience, there\u2019s a difference between what people say about you when you\u2019re in the room and what they say about you when you\u2019re not in it.\nWell, the same goes about your brand: reputation is built around honesty, and honesty starts with you.\nThink about what you would like your customers to say about your product, and then about how you can achieve that.\nKey phrase: \nHow would you like customers to react to your brand? Five-star reviews, great feedback about service, or recommendations to friends? There are no right or wrong answers, but, once again, the key is loyalty.\nIf you\u2019re loyal to Starbucks, you\u2019ll get more coffee than you pay for. That is why 25% of Starbucks\u2019 customers buy their coffee with a pre-loaded loyalty card. \nWhat opportunities do you give to your customers to demonstrate their loyalty to your brand? What do they get in return?\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Fortune Cookie Principle\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Fortune Cookie Principle\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Your Advantage Is Not Your Commodity\u2014But Your Story\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Recap of Jiwa\u2019s Twenty Keys to a Great Brand Story\nThe Fortune Cookie Principle\nWe all want fortune cookies, don\u2019t we?\nNow, ask yourself this: why do we want fortune cookies?\nAre they the best cookies? The tastiest ones? The most chocolate ones?\nMost people would say, undoubtedly, that it\u2019s neither: simply put, we like fortune cookies not because of the cookie, but because of the fortune.\nBernadette Jiwa says that the same principle should be the foundation of all business. Because people don\u2019t buy the commodity\u2014they buy the story behind it.\nYour Advantage Is Not Your Commodity\u2014But Your Story\nIn two equations, Bernadette Jiwa\u2019s point looks like this: \n\u2022 PRODUCT \u2013 MEANING = COMMODITY\n\u2022 PRODUCT + MEANING = BRAND\nIn other words, you don\u2019t have to be the best when it comes to your product: you just need to be \u201cgood enough.\u201d It is the story you attach to your product that gives it significance and meaning and which can make it something more than just commodity, i.e., a brand.\nAnd \u201cbrand\u201d is a different way of saying \u201ca successful future-proof company.\u201d\nA Recap of Jiwa\u2019s Twenty Keys to a Great Brand Story\nBernadette Jiwa thinks that you need to build your story around these twenty foundations: \nThe truth, vision, values, products and services, your people, the value you deliver, name and tagline, content and copy, design, your actions, customer experience, price and quality, perception, distribution, location, ubiquity or scarcity, community, reputation, reaction and reach. \nSome, of course, are more important than the others and, depending on your business, some might be of little importance, but \n.\nThe keys, however, are not meant to be prescriptive, Jiwa says: they are your starting point. But not ignoring them should eventually help you build emotional connections with your customers\u2014and precisely the ones you\u2019d like to serve.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nThe Fortune Cookie Principle Quotes\nFinal Notes\nmay seem like a rather simple book, but as Wendy Wilson Bett, co-founder of Peter\u2019s Yard says, overcomplicating does nobody favors.\nThe simple questions asked in this book, she goes on, should help everyone demystify the process of building a great brand. \n\u201cHad this book been available when I was driving Sales and Marketing Capabilities in my past corporate life at Cadbury Schweppes,\u201d she concludes, \u201cit would have been recommended reading.\u201d\nis more than a book for reading: it is a book for applying as well.\nSo, \n, \u201cread and apply!\u201d"},

Maybe that sounds a little hippy-dippy,\u201d they add, \u201cbut we\u2019re serious.\u201d\nis the product of this line of thinking. It is, in its essence, a collection of 87 tactics framed within four steps which should help you reclaim your time.\nWe\u2019ll have a look at some of the tactics in the final one of our \u201cKey Lessons\u201d\u2014but we strongly encourage you to buy this book and try out some other tactics as well. \nBecause, as we reveal in our \u201cSummary,\u201d this book is a sort of an encyclopedia for making time for the things that matter. \nSo, let\u2019s see \n and \n this book works.\nMost of Our Time Is Spent by Default\nIn the chaotic existence that is the twenty-first century, two very powerful forces compete for every minute of your time. \nThe first is what the authors call the \n, aka the \u201cculture of constant busyness\u2014the overflowing inboxes, stuffed calendars, and endless to-do lists.\u201d\n\u201cAccording to the Busy Bandwagon mindset,\u201d write Jake and JZ, \u201cif you want to meet the demands of the modern workplace and function in modern society, you must fill every minute with productivity. After all, everyone else is busy. If you slow down, you\u2019ll fall behind and never catch up.\u201d\nYou know how that feels, don\u2019t you?\nThe second force is something called \n, i.e., \u201capps and other sources of endlessly replenishing content,\u201d aka Facebook, YouTube, Google News, Netflix, HBO, Candy Crash, etc.\nA simple rule-of-thumb is that if you can pull to refresh and/or if it streams\u2014it\u2019s an Infinity Pool. \u201cThis always-available, always-new entertainment,\u201d write Jake and JZ, \u201cis your reward for the exhaustion of constant busyness.\u201d\nThe questions pose by themselves really: \u201cBut is constant busyness really mandatory? Is endless distraction really a reward? Or are we all just stuck on autopilot?\u201d\nYou already know the answers: no, no, and yes.\nIn other words, in a world which operates by the rules \u201creact,\u201d \u201crespond,\u201d \u201cfill your time,\u201d \u201cbe efficient,\u201d and \u201cget more things done,\u201d it\u2019s only normal that when something is irresistible and at your fingertips, you\u2019re bound to become addicted to it.\nIt\u2019s not like you want to watch the next YouTube video or that you \n \n to scroll down to see some newer social posts after doing that for the past five hours; \n.\nFortunately, there is a way out: setting your \ndefaults.\nMake Time Is Just Four Steps, Repeated Every Day\nAnd this is where \n comes in.\nIn the words of its authors:\n\u201c\n is a framework for choosing what you want to focus on, building the energy to do it, and breaking the default cycle so that you can start being more intentional about the way you live your life. Even if you don\u2019t completely control your own schedule\u2014and few of us do\u2014you absolutely can control your attention.\u201d\nAnd then they go on:\n\u201cWith new habits and new mindsets, you can stop reacting to the modern world and start actively making time for the people and activities that matter to you. This isn\u2019t about saving time. It\u2019s about making time for what matters.\u201d\nAnd you can do that in four simple steps which should be repeated daily, and which, in essence, are both sequential and circular: 1. Highlight \u2192 2. Laser \u21c4 3. Energize \u2192 4. Reflect \u2192 1. Highlight\u2026\nIn short:\n\u2022 First, you need to \n to prioritize in your day (there are 16 tactics that can help you with this);\n\u2022 Then, you need to employ specific tactics (one of 44) to \n;\n\u2022 Of course, to stay laser-focused on anything, you\u2019ll need \n, and you can do this by using one of the 27 tactics offered and described by Jake and JZ;\n\u2022 Finally, you\u2019ll \n to see where the tactics you\u2019ve used brought you.\nBut let\u2019s learn something more about each of these tactics.\nHighlight: Start Each Day by Choosing a Focal Point\nAs we said above, the first step in the \n framework is \n. \nContrary to what the Busy Bandwagon advocates shout around every corner (\u201cGet \ndone. Be \nefficient\u201d), Jake and JZ think that doing \n is what actually makes life worth living.\n, however, may seem scary at first: all of the other guys are rushing through life, you might think, and if I do \n, I\u2019m bound to fall behind them.\nThat\u2019s not true!\nBecause \nis primarily about doing what you want to do the most\u2014and \n doing the rest.\nSo, start every day by asking yourself a simple two-part question:\n\u201cIf, at the end of the day, someone asks you, \u2018What was the highlight of your day?\u2019 what do you want your answer to be?\u201d\nOr, to put that in another way, \u201cwhen you look back on your day, what activity or accomplishment or moment do you want to savor?\u201d\nWell, that\u2019s your Highlight, your focal point for the day, \n.\nIt can be anything, from your \n through the \nto the \nof your day. But it has to be one, and it has to be the answer to the question: \u201cWhat do I want to be the highlight of my day?\u201d\nTo answer this question, use these three criteria:\n\u2022 \n: What\u2019s the most pressing thing I have to do today?\n\u2022\n: At the end of the day, which Highlight will bring me the most satisfaction?\n\u2022 \n: When I reflect on today, what will bring me the most joy?\nA good rule of thumb is to \n. And to choose the best one, use one of these seven Highlight Tactics (see the \u201cKey Lessons\u201d section for more):\n1. Write It Down\n2. Groundhog It (or, \u201cDo Yesterday Again\u201d)\n3. Stack Rank Your Life\n4. Batch the Little Stuff\n5. The Might-Do List\n6. The Burner List\n7. Run a Personal Sprint\nChoosing your Highlight is not enough; you need to make time for it (i.e., prioritize it). And you can do this using any one of these nine tactics:\n8. Schedule Your Highlight\n9. Block Your Calendar\n10. Bulldoze Your Calendar\n11. Flake It Till You Make It\n12. Just Say No\n13. Design Your Day\n14. Become a Morning Person\n15. Nighttime Is Highlight Time\n16. Quit When You\u2019re Done\nLaser: Beat Distraction to Make Time for Your Highlight\nNow that you\u2019ve chosen and made time for the Highlight of your day\u2014the \n hard part comes: you need to put all your energy to \n and really execute the job.\nAnd to focus, you need to go into a peculiar state of mind called Laser:\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in Laser mode,\u201d write JZ and Jake, \u201cyour attention is focused on the present like a laser beam shining on a target. You\u2019re in the flow, fully engaged, and immersed in the moment. When you\u2019re laser-focused on your Highlight, it feels fantastic\u2014it\u2019s the payoff for proactively choosing what\u2019s important to you.\u201d\nThe problem?\nDistraction\u2014the #1 enemy of your Laser Mode of being. Distraction, say the authors, is \u201clike a giant disco ball in the path of your laser beam: Light goes everywhere except in the direction of the target. When that happens, you can easily end up missing out on your Highlight.\u201d\nAnd, of course, distractions (social media, email, breaking news, Netflix, cat GIFs, etc.) are just about everywhere.\nFor example, Apple reports that people unlock their phones an average of 80 times a day. Moreover, according to a customer-research firm called Dscout, people \ntheir phones an average of 2,617 times per day.\n\u201cDistracted,\u201d conclude JZ and Jake justly, \u201chas become the new default.\u201d\nAnd this is nothing strange\u2014due to at least four reasons:\n\u2022 The appeal of\u2014and\nour\n\u2014technology\n\u2022\nThe\nof technological products\n\u2022\nThe sheer number of \non the market\n\u2022\nOur\nThere are, fortunately, ways you can change this, and, even more fortunately, they don\u2019t include willpower and discipline (as you know full well, they, alone, don\u2019t help).\nHere\u2019s a list of tactics which can help you instead:\n17. Try a Distraction-Free Phone\n18. Log Out\n19. Nix Notifications\n20. Clear Your Homescreen\n21. Wear a Wristwatch\n22. Leave Devices Behind\n23. Skip the Morning Check-In\n24. Block Distraction Kryptonite\n25. Ignore the News\n26. Put Your Toys Away\n27. Fly Without Wi-Fi\n28. Put a Timer on the Internet\n29. Cancel the Internet\n30. Watch Out for Time Craters\n31. Trade Fake Wins for Real Wins\n32. Turn Distractions into Tools\n33. Become a Fair-Weather Fan\n34. Deal with Email at the End of the Day\n35. Schedule Email Time\n36. Empty Your Inbox Once a Week\n37. Pretend Messages Are Letters\n38. Be Slow to Respond\n39. Reset Expectations\n40. Set Up Send-Only Email\n41. Vacation Off the Grid\n42. Lock Yourself Out\n43. Don\u2019t Watch the News\n44. Put Your TV in the Corner\n45. Ditch Your TV for a Projector\n46. Go \u00e0 la Carte Instead of All-You-Can-Eat\n47. If You Love Something, Set It Free\n48. Shut the Door\n49. Invent a Deadline\n50. Explode Your Highlight\n51. Play a Laser Sound Track\n52. Set a Visible Timer\n53. Avoid the Lure of Fancy Tools\n54. Start on Paper\n55. Make a \u201cRandom Question\u201d List\n56. Notice One Breath\n57. Be Bored\n58. Be Stuck\n59. Take a Day Off\n60. Go All In\nEnergize: Use the Body to Recharge the Brain\n\u201cTo achieve focus and make time for what matters,\u201d write JZ and Jake, \u201cyour brain needs energy, and that energy comes from taking care of your body.\u201d\nEven though the lifestyle defaults of the 21\n century make it hard to believe, charging your batteries (whether through exercise, food, sleep, quiet, or face-to-face time) is an all-important part of the human existence.\nSneaking a nap, exercising, learning how to use caffeine strategically\u2014these are all just simple shifts which can get you some energy necessary for you to go both through your day and through your to-do list.\nBecause what all of those productivity books don\u2019t tell you is one of the simplest truths you\u2019ll ever hear: the modern brain-based lifestyle is \n, and you still have a hunter-gatherer body roaring for health and energy.\nFortunately, it\u2019s not that difficult to change things:\nThe hunter-gatherers from the past were constantly on his feet, walking, carrying, lifting, and working. Consequently, your brain performs better when in motion. You don\u2019t need to be a bodybuilder or train for a marathon to wake up the caveman inside you: these four tactics should help you recharge your brain batteries just as well:\n61. Exercise Every Day (but Don\u2019t Be a Hero)\n62. Pound the Pavement\n63. Inconvenience Yourself\n64. Squeeze in a Super Short Workout\nLet\u2019s face it, it\u2019s pretty simple when it comes to food, both with regard to health and energy: eat only what the cavemen could find and catch (fruits, vegetables, animals, nuts) and avoid invented and manufactured foods. Do this with one of these five tactics:\n65. Eat Like a Hunter-Gatherer\n66. Central Park Your Plate\n67. Stay Hungry\n68. Snack Like a Toddler\n69. Go on the Dark Chocolate Plan\nOK, cavemen didn\u2019t really drink coffee, but, as far as caffeine is concerned, we are the ones with the upper hand: caffeine reenergizes quickly and effectively, and, if you use it well, you\u2019re doing a good job.\n70. Wake Up Before You Caffeinate\n71. Caffeinate Before You Crash\n72. Take a Caffeine Nap\n73. Maintain Altitude with Green Tea\n74. Turbo Your Highlight\n75. Learn Your Last Call\n76. Disconnect Sugar\nIn the world of our ancient ancestors, almost nothing ever happened. That\u2019s why \n and work much less than you: quiet is the norm for them, and the noise of the distractions around you are a disaster for your energy levels. So:\n77. Get Woodsy\n78. Trick Yourself into Meditating\n79. Leave Your Headphones at Home\n80. Take Real Breaks\nHow many Facebook friends do you have? How many of them are your \n friends? Well, cavemen didn\u2019t have the former: all of their interactions were face-to-face. Kick it old school and charge your batteries by spending some distraction-free time with the people who make you happy. The best shortcut toward happiness:\n81. Spend Time with Your Tribe\n82. Eat Without Screens\nOf course, it\u2019s metaphorical; but that doesn\u2019t make it less true. Start \n in your bedroom by, well, sleeping. No screens, no schedules, no caffeine, no nothing besides a bed in your bedroom. Well, that\u2019s the first of the five tactics which will help you rest better\u2014and \nrested more:\n83. Make Your Bedroom a Bed Room\n84. Fake the Sunset\n85. Sneak a Nap\n86. Don\u2019t Jet-Lag Yourself\n87. Put On Your Own Oxygen Mask First\nReflect: Adjust and Improve Your System\nThough at first glance somewhat negligible, the final step of the Make Time framework may be the most important\u2014because it\u2019s actually what separates the scientific method from pseudoscientific activities.\nNamely, the scientific method consists of no more than four steps:\n#1. \n what\u2019s going on.\n#2. \n why things are happening the way they are.\n#3. \n to test your hypothesis.\n#4. \n the results and decide whether you were right.\nWell, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll be doing before going to bed: taking a few notes, and, subsequently, using these notes to decide which tactics you want to continue, which ones you want to refine, and which ones you\u2019d rather drop.\nOver time, this kind of behavior will help you build \u201ca customized daily system tailored to your unique habits and routines, your unique brain and body, and your unique goals and priorities.\u201d\nSpeaking of\u2014\nThe Make Time Tactics: Pick, Test, Repeat\nEven though \nincludes dozens of tactics, it is fairly obvious that many of these tactics won\u2019t work for you.\nFortunately, that is nothing strange there.\nis like a cookbook: \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t try all the recipes at once, and you don\u2019t need to do all the tactics at once, either.\u201d\nInstead, you\u2019ll \n and \n.\nBegin by taking note of all the tactics you want to try. Look for the ones your guts tell you are the best: may they be both doable but a little challenging as well; above all, may they be fun.\nAnd the first day you\u2019ll try to put \n into practice, the authors suggest that you \n one tactic from each step.\nIn other words, choose \n of the 18 Highlight tactics, \n which will keep you laser-focused by changing how you react to distractions, and one for building energy; so, that\u2019s \n.\nNow that you\u2019ve picked the tactics, \n them for a few days.\nSince the fourth step of the Make Time manual includes reflecting upon results, you\u2019ll know by the end of, say, your third day whether any one of the tactics works. If it does\u2014keep it; if not\u2014modify or switch.\nAnd then\u2014\n the process.\nIn time, you should be able to combine more tactics within a single step, and even invent new ones through modifications. Each day is a chance to experiment\u2014until you get the perfect version of the Make Time system.\nAnd when we say \u201cperfect,\u201d we mean \u201cperfect \nBecause that\u2019s what this book is about: building a personalized Make Time system version which \n could fit into your existing lifestyle to better its quality.\nWhen that happens\u2014throw away the book!\nKey Lessons from \u201cMake Time\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Get Off the Busy Bandwagon (But Stay Out of the Infinity Pools as Well)\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Make Time Is a Four-Step Framework\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quick Start Guide to Make Time\nGet Off the Busy Bandwagon (But Stay Out of the Infinity Pools as Well)\nIn the dynamic world of the 21\n century, two powerful forces compete for every single minute of your waking life: The Busy Bandwagon and the Infinity Pools.\nThe Busy Bandwagon is this \u201cculture of constant busyness,\u201d and the Infinity Pools are all those \u201capps and other sources of endlessly replenishing content.\u201d\nIn more practical terms, the Busy Bandwagon is everything you have on your calendar, and to-do lists and the Infinity Pools are all the distractions that keep you from completing these tasks (Facebook, YouTube, Netflix, etc.)\nThe Busy Bandwagon says, \u201cget more things done;\u201d the Infinity Pools say \u201cfuhgeddaboudit.\u201d \nJake Knapp and John Zeratsky (JZ) say that the trick is to listen to neither: you should get \n things done by \n \nting about the world happening around you.\nThat\u2019s what quality of life \n is.\nMake Time Is a Four-Step Framework\nIn other words, Jake and JZ advise that you need to make time in your day for the things you really want to do. And that\u2019s a four-step process which is both sequential and repetitive:\n#1. \n: the process starts with choosing a single activity you\u2019ll prioritize over all others in your calendar, the thing you want to be the answer to the question \u201cWhat was the highlight of your day?\u201d posed at the end of it;\n#2. \n: now that you know the task you want to prioritize, devise tactics to focus on its completion;\n#3. \n: move, eat real food, optimize caffeine, and sleep well, to energize your body so that your brain can stay focused for longer periods of time; and, finally:\n#4. \n: spend at least ten minutes each night to see what worked and what didn\u2019t so that you can modify or switch tactics the following day.\nQuick Start Guide to Make Time\nNow, Jake and JZ offer no less than 87 tactics\u2014only some of which may work for you. We\u2019ve listed all of them above, but you don\u2019t need all of them: you just need the ones that will work for you.\nTo discover them, of course, you\u2019ll need to experiment. And here\u2019s a quick start guide to make time right away (if you\u2019re not sure where to begin):\n \n(Tactic #1)\n(Tactic #8)\nNothing could be simpler than this: just write down your highlight, decide how much time you need for it, and schedule it on your calendar next to a note \u201cI\u2019m going to do this within this time period, no matter what.\u201d\n (Tactic #24)\nEvery one of us has a distraction kryptonite: it may be Facebook or lichess.org; either way, \u201cif after spending a few minutes (or, more likely, a few minutes that become an hour) with this website or app you feel regret, it\u2019s probably Kryptonite.\u201d \nFree yourself any way you can from this \n Infinity Pool, and see how your attention would change.\n (Tactic #62)\nWe are born to walk and sitting all day does nobody any favors. Fortunately, it\u2019s easy to incorporate walking within your daily schedules: just jump off the bus two stops early or park far away (bonus: you won\u2019t lose time searching for the perfect spot!). \u201cA few minutes of walking each day provides a boost for the body and quiet for the mind.\u201d\nDon\u2019t commit to any of the tactics above: try them for three days and take notes. If they don\u2019t work\u2014modify or try another tactic.

Great men are almost always bad men.\u201d\nPopulated with more Hitlers and Stalins than you can imagine, the twentieth century proved Lord Acton\u2019s concerns more than just reasonable\u2014it proved them right. During the 1970s, Acton\u2019s prophetic words echoed all around the leading democratic country in the world as well, the USA.\nDemonstrating the extent to which power can be abused, the Watergate scandal changed American politics forever, leading to a still-felt surge of distrust toward the government and the presidential position. \nAnd this is how it unfolded.\nWatergate Scandal Summary\nJune\u2013November 1972: Something Is Rotten in the State of America\nOn June 17, 1972, five men\u2014\n, and\n\u2014attempt to break in to the HQ of the Democratic National Committee located about a mile from the White House, at the Watergate Complex.\nA security guard notices some tape on a door latch, and suspecting foul play, calls the police. They arrive just on time to catch the five men red-handed. \n, White House press secretary, describes the incident as a \u201cthird-rate burglary.\u201d \nImmediately after the break-in, \nsends one of its young crime reporters, \n, to investigate the story. Another young reporter by the name of \n joins in, volunteering to make some phone calls.\nThree days later, Bob Woodward has the first of his meetings with arguably the most famous informant in journalist history: \n.\npublishes the first in a series of articles written by Woodward and Bernstein. \nTitled \u201c\n,\u201d the article reveals that a $25,000 cashier\u2019s check, earmarked for the Nixon campaign, has somehow wound up in the bank account of one of the Watergate burglars.\nSuspicions arise as to whether the Watergate break-in was just a usual burglary, but President Richard Nixon denies any such thing:\nAside, however, he tells, \n, an attorney and consultant of his, to find ways to cover up the White House\u2019s connection to the break-in.\nOn August 30, 1972, Nixon announces that Dean\u2019s internal investigation has found no evidence of White House involvement in the break-in.\nAfter publishing a few more stories related to the Watergate Scandal (amid threats coming from the White House), on October 10, 1972, \n prints another article by Woodward and Bernstein, titled \u201c\n.\u201d\nIts opening two paragraphs make startling allegations:\nVery few people believe Woodward and Bernstein, with many doubting the credibility of their source, Deep Throat.\nIn fact, unlike \n,\nmost of the media at the time concentrate on reporting related to the 1972 presidential election, where Richard Nixon is predicted to win.\nRichard Nixon wins the 1972 US presidential election by a landslide, taking 60% of the popular vote and winning 49 states; Washington D.C. is the only one won by his opponent, George McGovern, Democratic Senator of South Dakota.\nReceiving almost 18 million votes more than McGovern, Nixon holds the record for the widest popular vote margin in US presidential election history to this day.\nJune 1971\u2013June 1972: Flashbacks of a CREEP\nFour years before his reelection, almost to the day, Richard Nixon defeats the Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey in one of the closest elections in U.S. history.\nAt Richard Nixon\u2019s order, \n and his staff (including Deputy Assistant \n) work with the US Secret Service to install a secret taping system which records all conversation in the Oval Office and the Cabinet Room.\nThree months later, microphones are added to Nixon\u2019s private office in the Old Executive Office Building. The following year microphones are installed in the presidential lodge at Camp David as well.\nOn June 13, 1971, \n begins publishing the Pentagon Papers.\nOfficially titled \u201cReport of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Vietnam Task Force,\u201d the papers are released by \n, US military analyst, and chronicle America\u2019s secret history of the Vietnam War.\nThe Papers demonstrate that the Johnson administration had systematically and thoroughly lied to both the public and the Congress.\nA week after the Pentagon Papers are released, the White House establishes a \u201cSpecial Investigation Unit\u201d\u2014more colloquially known as the \n\u2014whose sole task is to stop or quickly respond to the leaking of classified information such as the ones disclosed by Ellsberg.\nThe unuttered\u2014but key\u2014phrase is: \u201cby any means necessary.\u201d\nTrue to this dictum, on September 3, 1971, the White House Plumbers burglarize Daniel Ellsberg\u2019s psychiatrist\u2019s office in an attempt to dig up compromising info on the military analyst, with an obvious objective to discredit him later.\nAt the beginning of 1971, the Committee for the Re-Election of the President is established. \nIts members include some of the White House Plumbers (such as \n and \n), in addition to some new faces such as \n, the Campaign Director, \n,\n, and others.\nThough abbreviated as CRP, the Committee would later come to be derisively known as CREEP due to its involvement in the Watergate Scandal and the use of numerous dirty tricks in the campaign.\nOn February 24, 1972, a letter reaches the editor of the \nwhich implies that Senator \n, a candidate for the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination, holds prejudice against French-Canadian Americans.\nTwo days later, Muskie delivers a famous \u201ccrying speech\u201d apology, which severely harms his chances to beat George McGovern.\nBy the end of the year, it is revealed that the letter is forged by \nand \n, members of CREEP.\nAs evidence would later show, members of CREEP break into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s Watergate headquarters and steal copies of top-secret documents.\nIn addition, they bug the office\u2019s phones.\nBecause the original wiretaps failed to work properly, on June 17, CREEP returned to the Watergate building. At 2:30 a.m. five members of CREEP are arrested inside the DNC HQ.\n1973: And Now, The End Is Near\nAfter pleading innocent, \n, a former FBI agent, and \n, a former CIA employee and security director of CREEP, are found guilty of conspiracy, burglary and bugging the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee.\n and four others involved plead guilty and, thus, end their trials.\nEstablished by the United States Senate Resolution 60, the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities\u2014colloquially known as Senate Watergate Committee\u2014begins its work, with Senator \n acting as is its chairman.\nIts mission is to investigate the break-in at the DNC HQ and \u201call other illegal, improper, or unethical conduct occurring during the presidential election of 1972, including political espionage and campaign finance practices.\u201d\nTwo weeks after an official White House statement reiterates that President Nixon had no prior knowledge of the Watergate Scandal, several White House officials\u2014 \n, \n, and attorney general \n\u2014resign from their positions.\nYet another one, \n, is fired; Nixon makes this known appearing on national television. What he doesn\u2019t know yet is that Dean has already started cooperating with the Watergate persecutors.\nThe Senate Watergate Committee begins televised hearings. \n is appointed as the Justice Department\u2019s special prosecutor in the Watergate investigation.\nJohn Dean testifies before the Senate Watergate Committee, giving a 245-page prepared statement which lasts a total of seven hours.\nIn it, he makes claims that not only Nixon was involved in the break-in cover-up, but also that the White House had conducted political espionage for years.\nThe day of arguably the most explosive revelation during the trials: supposing that he is merely confirming Haldeman\u2019s testimony, \n says that Nixon\u2019s office had been taped since 1971:\nBy letter, Sam Ervin demands the tapes from Nixon, who, almost immediately after Butterfield\u2019s testimony, disconnects the tapes. Nixon declines to turn over the tapes, saying that\nFederal Judge \n orders Nixon to hand in the tapes to him to be examined in private. Nixon refuses to comply yet again and appeals all orders and subpoenas related to surrendering the tapes.\nOn October 19, 1973, Nixon proposes a compromise to the Senate Watergate Committee. Namely, instead of handing over the tapes, Nixon suggests giving the Committee a summary of the White House conversations, personally edited by him, and later verified by Senator \n. \nArchibald Cox declines this compromise and orders the President to hand him over the tapes. \nNixon orders Attorney General \nto fire Cox. Richardson, instead, resigns. Then Nixon orders Richardson\u2019s deputy, \n, to fire Cox; he too prefers to resign instead. Finally, Richard Nixon\u2019s solicitor general, \n, fires Cox.\nThis astonishing sequence of events is dubbed by the press \u201cThe Saturday Night Massacre,\u201d a name which stands to this day.\nTen days later, \n is named the new special prosecutor.\nDuring a televised Q&A session with the Associated Press editors gathered at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, Nixon famously says that \u201cpeople have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I\u2019m not a crook. I\u2019ve earned everything I\u2019ve got.\u201d\nThe White House reveals that two of the subpoenaed recordings are missing and that one of the delivered ones\u2014dated June 20, 1972\u2014has an 18-minute gap. \nNixon\u2019s secretary, \n claims that she must have accidentally erased the part in question by pushing the wrong foot pedal while talking on the phone.\nHowever, photos posted for the media undermine the likelihood of such occurrence, and, soon after, experts conclude that there are multiple erasures.\nAs a result, people start suspecting that evidence is being destroyed. \n1974: What Happens in the White House (\n) Stay in the White House\nSeven members of Nixon\u2019s former staff\u2014known as the Watergate Seven\u2014are indicted by a grand jury for their involvement in the post-Watergate break-in cover-up; many end up serving jail time. The Jury names Nixon an \u201cunindicted co-conspirator.\u201d\nIgnoring the subpoenas, Nixon announces the release of 1,200 pages of edited transcripts of the remaining White House tapes. \nEven this turns public opinion against him: \u201cReading the transcripts is an emetic experience,\u201d wrote the \nat the time, \u201cone comes away feeling unclean.\u201d\nThe Supreme Court unanimously (8\u20130) decides that the President must surrender all of the White House tapes.

That\u2019s all there is to that. They have to be paid.\u201d\nOn August 5, 1974, a previously unknown conversation between Nixon and Haldeman, dated just six days after the Watergate break-in, is released.\nThe recording conclusively proves that Nixon and Haldeman obstructed justice by having the CIA falsely claim to the FBI that the Watergate break-in is a national security issue so as to prevent them from investigating further.\nReferred to as \u201cThe Smoking Gun,\u201d the tape proves\u2014in the words of Nixon\u2019s own lawyers\u2014\u201dthat the President had lied to the nation, to his closest aides, and to his own lawyers \u2013 for more than two years.\u201d\nFacing certain impeachment, Richard Nixon decides to resign:\n1974\u20132014: It\u2019s Different\u2026 \u201cWhen the President Does It\u201d\nNixon\u2019s successor, Gerald Ford, issues Proclamation 4311 which gives Nixon a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes he may have committed during his time as a president.\nDescribed by \nas a \u201cprofoundly unwise, divisive and unjust act,\u201d the pardon is often seen as one of the main reasons why Ford would lose the 1976 presidential election.\nIn the month of May 1977, after spending two years away from public life, Richard Nixon grants British journalist Robert Frost an exclusive series of interviews.\nIn the first part of the interview, Nixon apologizes for his actions:\nHowever, when asked about the legality of his actions in the third part of the interview, Nixon replies in a highly controversial manner: \u201cWell, when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.\u201d\nFour days after suffering a debilitating stroke, Richard Nixon dies at the age of 81, his image rehabilitated by a series of foreign trips and nine books.\n confirms something strongly suspected by everybody\u2014including Nixon\u2014ever since the first Woodward and Bernstein article: Deep Throat had been none other but former FBI agent, \n.

What about \u201cit\u2019s like this\u201d or \u201cthis is it?\u201d\nKelly Corrigan learned to say these\u2014and 9 other\u2014phrases the hard way.\nAnd she shares her stories in her unique memoir:\nWho Should Read \u201cTell Me More\u201d? And Why?\nis a book for everyone who wants to read biographies\u2014especially if you are a fan of Kelly Corrigan and her previous works.\nIt is also a book for everyone who wants a little guidance in life. After all, the best way to learn what to do is through other people\u2019s stories.\nAnd Corrigan knows how to tell them.\nAbout Kelly Corrigan\n is an American writer.\nGraduate of the University of Richmond, she received her Masters in Literature from the San Francisco State University.\nIn addition to numerous articles for magazines such as \nand \n,\nshe has also written four books so far: \n, \n, \n, and \n.\nFind out more at \n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cTell Me More PDF Summary\u201d\nTrying to name the phrases that make love and connection possible, as the blurb of \nstates, seems like a crazy idea.\nAfter all, on the face of it, love and connection are two just too complex phenomena to be framed into language. It is for the reason that, instinctively, we often think of love as something of a shortcut to telepathy. Two people in love (be they spouses, best friends, or a mother and a child) are capable of understanding each other without the use of words, almost exclusively through glances, smiles, kisses, and touches.\n\u201cThe other problem with language,\u201d adds Kelly Corrigan, \u201cis that arranging words into sentences requires we flip on our thinking machine, which necessarily claims some of our focus, so that as soon as we start deciding how to explain a feeling, we\u2019re not entirely feeling the feeling anymore, and some feelings want to be felt at full capacity.\u201d\nSuch are the feelings Corrigan conveys through the 12 stories in her book, each of which simultaneously mocks \u201cthe reach of language\u201d and, yet, is conveniently captured in the title in the net of just a few simple words:\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s like this.\u201d \u201cTell me more.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cI was wrong.\u201d \u201cGood enough.\u201d \u201cI love you.\u201d \u201cNo words at all.\u201d \u201cOnward.\u201d \u201cThis is it.\u201d\nFor our summary today, we share a few of Corrigan\u2019s stories.\nIt\u2019s Like This\nThree months after her beloved dad Greenie had passed away, the life of Kelly Corrigan fell apart.\n\u201cThere was no real reason for it to fall apart that morning,\u201d she writes. \u201cAnd, in fact, \ndidn\u2019t. I did.\u201d\nOn the face of it, it was just another regular morning at the Corrigans. However, by the time Kelly had opened her eyes waking from a pleasant dream to the smell of bacon (her husband\u2019s everyday breakfast), the whole world seemed to her as if already out of joint.\nIt\u2019s not that something especially alarming had happened\u2014it was, more or less, the usual routine. Only this time, it hit Kelly hard\u2014and she was overwhelmed.\nKelly heard her teenage daughters\u2014Georgia (16), a \u201cworld-class procrastinator\u201d, and Claire (14), a Lin-Manuel Miranda fan\u2014fighting over who\u2019s wearing whose shirt once again, and, before too long, saw Edward, her husband (a Ben Stiller lookalike and a diehard Warriors fan) leaving for work.\nThat was always his way of dealing with things. \u201cLet \u2018em fight!\u201d he had learned from \n he had ever read, and so he always did just that. Kelly couldn\u2019t stand that\u2014just as she couldn\u2019t stand the mess that she was in the morning or the mess in the kitchen.\nShe was about to shout and rage and break every single thing around her into a thousand tiny smithereens when she remembered the favorite phrase of her meditation teacher: \u201cit\u2019s like this.\u201d\nSometimes, life is just like this. Unbearable, untidy, chaotic. As a consequence, we become irritable and ready to be angry at just about anyone. However, that changes nothing. The only thing we can do is accept life in all its messiness, taking a deep breath and saying: \u201cit\u2019s like this.\u201d\nTell Me More\n\u201cWhy are you trying to fix things! I just need you to listen!\u201d\u00a0\nProbably every man on this planet has heard these words quite a few times in his life. The problem is they do not really understand them: they rarely listen, and, instead, always offer solutions.\u00a0\nHowever, even when these solutions make a lot of sense (such as in \n), they usually end up only making matters worse. Why shouldn\u2019t they? You\u2019re calling a cab for someone who actually just wants to ride with you: the destination is irrelevant.\nKelly\u2019s friend Tracy seems to have understood this better than anyone. Possibly because as difficult as it is in relationships, it is even more difficult to \n listen when it comes to your children. \u201cIt is a bit like watching someone struggle over a puzzle,\u201d Tracy said once to Kelly, \u201cand you have the final piece in your pocket.\u201d\nWatching your child suffer over something you can solve is possibly one of the most challenging things a parent will ever be asked to do. And, yet, in a way, it is one of the things you should do most often.\nKelly learned this in practice.\nOnce, Tracy was with her when her daughter Georgia (then eleven) called her to complain over the fact that nobody likes her at school. Apparently, she was accused by another girl (Piper) that she had been mean to her (even though she wasn\u2019t), but nobody believed her.\nKelly was torn between two things: either ask Georgia what she had done (because she must have done \n, mustn\u2019t she?) or go straight to her school. Instead, advised by Tracy, she just said: \u201cTell me more.\u201d\nAnd Georgia did tell her everything. By the end of the discussion, she wasn\u2019t crying anymore.\nNo\nWe\u2019ve talked about \n As far as Kelly Corrigan is concerned, it seems that we should be talking about it even more.\n\u201cSexually, professionally, personally,\u201d she writes, \u201csaying \u2018No\u2019 takes balls. One friend told me her one big take away from three years, and $11,000 of therapy was \u2018Learn to say no and when you do, don\u2019t complain and don\u2019t explain. Every excuse you make is like an invitation to ask you again in a different way.\u2019\u201d\nKelly\u2019s mother knew how to say no. \u201cShe had her own mind, and she used it,\u201d Corrigan writes. In other words, she never bothered about what other people might think of her if she declines their invitation to do something or go somewhere. She\u2019d just wave them off with a simple no-excuses no and, instead, spend the evening alone, calm and happy:\n\u201cIt must be possible to say \u2018No\u2019 nicely and still be loved,\u201d Kelly writes, remembering her mother. After all, no matter how many times her mother had said \u201cno,\u201d she was always adored by her (and by all of her family).\nChildren are exceptional at saying \u201cno;\u201d adults are very bad at this. Kelly was great when she was a child: after her mother had ordered the wrong thing for her birthday, Kelly refused to eat cheese for the next ten years\u2014even though it was her favorite food.\u00a0\nWe guess Kelly isn\u2019t as good at saying \u201cno\u201d anymore, because the story she relates to us to describe the power of \u201cno\u201d and its value as an interhuman connector is one in which the \u201cno\u201d comes from her husband.\nYou see, Kelly had a plan for her life: she wanted to give birth to four children by the time of her 40\n birthday, and with 2 already under the belt at 36, she was way on course to make her dream a reality.\nBut then she had to battle with cancer, and the chemotherapy suspended her fertility. She had no option but to move to Plan B, so she asked her husband if he wanted to adopt two children.\nYou already know what Edward said: \u201cNo.\u201d\nHe was at a good place in his life at the time\u2014happily married with two children\u2014and it was time for him to dedicate more time to himself and his career.\nKelly was, at first, devastated, but she soon realized that, as difficult as this \u201cno\u201d was, it was the only way out of an unpredictable and messy future. If Edward hadn\u2019t been a bit selfish, he might have regretted it later on, and maybe their marriage would have come under threat.\nTo sum up, no matter what they say to you, and no matter how difficult it is to utter it, \u201cno\u201d is a word of love. Use it wisely.\nGood Enough\nDo you know why Jewish children are religiously initiated at the age of 13?\nWell, Kelly didn\u2019t, and soon after the bat mitzvah of Ruby\u2014daughter of her friend Ariel\u2014finished, she asked the Rabbi named Michael for the reason.\nMichael told her that the age of thirteen is pivotal in a human\u2019s life. It is not merely a moment of incredible intellectual growth, but also the point of no return into adulthood.\nThough simple, the goal of these imitations is as significant as anything: to tell the children of yesterday that the world of tomorrow is theirs for the taking. To pat them on the back and make sure that they are able to understand their power to be something more than just mere passers-by and to become the change they want to see in the world.\nThere\u2019s nothing more important than this belief, says Kelly Corrigan. For children of 13, most adults are almost mythical figures, bigger-than-life heroes who can do just about anything.\nThat\u2019s why it is important that these people show the thirteen-year-olds of the world that they are not that much different.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it works,\u201d writes Corrigan. \u201cSomeone important believes in us, loudly and with conviction and against all substantiation, and over time, we begin to believe, too\u2014not in our shot at perfection, mind you, but in the good enough version of us that they have reflected.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cTell Me More\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Putting Your Feelings Into Words\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Learn to Live with the Complexity of Things\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Most Beautiful Three Words in the English Language\nPutting Your Feelings Into Words\nSometimes, it is difficult to put feelings into words. Kelly Corrigan argues that, when it matters the most, it is downright impossible to do that.\nWhy?\nBecause to express something, you need to use language, and language is something your brain does. Consequently, you can\u2019t say how you feel without first stopping yourself from feeling that thing for a moment to put it into words.\nMaybe there is a way to circumvent this.\u00a0\nJust use the usual phrases, the clich\u00e9s if you will, empowered by the feelings and uttered as if for the first time: \u201cIt\u2019s like this.\u201d \u201cTell me more.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cI was wrong.\u201d \u201cGood enough.\u201d \u201cI love you.\u201d \u201cNo words at all.\u201d \u201cOnward.\u201d \u201cThis is it.\u201d\nLearn to Live with the Complexity of Things\nBeing honest with yourself starts with three simple words: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Socrates turned this into a method for extracting knowledge; you ought to turn in a way of life.\nTake Kelly for example.\nRaised in a devoutly Catholic Irish-American family, she still doesn\u2019t know what to make of God. Throughout her life, she has \u201cstood in every square on the board: obedient believer, secretly hopeful, open-but-dubious\u2026 walked away from the board entirely, only to circle back.\u201d\nNowadays, all she can say is this: \u201cI\u2019m not sure of anything.\u201d But that\u2019s quite enough\u2014life is a mystery, and we should live it that way more often than not.\n\u201cI try to be one of the exceptional people who can live with the complexity of things,\u201d Kelly writes, \u201cwho are at peace with the unknown and the unknowable, who leave all the cages open. I tell myself: There\u2019s so much that you don\u2019t know, you can\u2019t know, you aren\u2019t ever going to know.\u201d\nThe Most Beautiful Three Words in the English Language\nAs powerful as they are, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d are nobody\u2019s favorite words in the English language; nor are \u201cit\u2019s like this,\u201d \u201ctell me more,\u201d \u201cI was wrong,\u201d or \u201cThis is it\u201d\u2014three phrases Kelly analyzes through her stories.\nThe most beautiful three words in the English language can\u2019t be any other but \u201cI love you,\u201d can they?\u00a0\nKelly sums up their power beautifully in three sentences we just had to quote:\n\u201cThe first time the words pass between two people: electrifying. Ten thousand times later: cause for marvel. The last time: the dream you revisit over and over and over again.\u201d\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cTell Me More Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nlost to Tara Westover\u2019s \nin the race for the \u201cBest Memoir & Autobiography\u201d award at the annual 2018 GoodReads Choice Awards, but just like Michele Obama\u2019s \n or Lisa Brennan-Jobs\u2019 \n, it was among the nominees for a reason.\nCandid, fearless, and warm, the book is a joy to read. Even though a memoir, it offers a piercing view beneath the surface of our shared humanity, exploring everyone\u2019s hunger for love and connection in 12 highly personal stories, each of which, in its own way, demonstrates just how similar we are\u2014in all our differences."},

It is also a book for all the men who want to understand their wives, their girlfriends, their mothers, their sisters\u2014and do something to make them happier.\nAbout Lisa Taddeo\n is an American writer.\nA two-time recipient of the Pushcart Prize (2017, 2019), she has published numerous short stories in magazines such as \n, \n, \n, \n, and others.\nHer short story \u201c\n\u201d won the Andrew Lytle Prize for the best story published in 2018 by \n.\nCurrently working on her first novel, \nis Taddeo\u2019s debut nonfiction work.\n\u00a0\u201cThree Women PDF Summary\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the nuances of desire that hold the truth of who we are at our rawest moments,\u201d writes Lisa Taddeo in the \u201cPrologue\u201d to \n.\nThat\u2019s why\u2014additionally stirred by the fact that her mother, for reasons unknown to Lisa, allowed for years an old man she didn\u2019t know to masturbate to her going to work\u2014Taddeo set out \u201cto register the heat and sting of female want so that men and other women might more easily comprehend before they condemn.\u201d\n\u201cBecause,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s the quotidian minutes of our lives that will go on forever, that will tell us who we were, who our neighbors and our mothers were, when we were too diligent in thinking they were nothing like us.\u201d\nAs suggested by the title\u2014perhaps borrowed from Robert Musil\u2019s collection of three novellas\u2014Taddeo\u2019s debut work is the story of three women, whose sexual lives and desires the author followed and painstakingly recorded for almost a decade.\nTheir names are Maggie (real name), Lina, and Sloane (pseudonyms).\nMaggie\nWhen we first meet Maggie, she is a 23-year-old girl from Fargo, North Dakota, going to court to confront the town\u2019s favorite teacher, Aaron Knodel.\nBy her account, six years before that\u2014when she was just a teenager in the second semester of her freshman year\u2014Aaron Knodel had seduced and used her in the way a \u201cwholesomely carnal\u201d teacher \u201cpossessing the strut of a movie star\u201d can seduce and use a 17-year-old dream-eyed child completely and utterly enthralled with him.\nInterestingly, during their years-long affair, the two never had sex: Aaron never allowed that. They did everything else, though\u2014even with Aaron\u2019s children in the same house, sleeping\u2014until, one day, Aaron\u2019s wife discovered the texts between the two and Aaron abruptly ended everything with Maggie.\nMaggie was devastated.\u00a0\nWith Aaron, it was the first time in her life that she felt something as profound and as beautiful as love. \u201cLike many girls her age,\u201d writes Taddeo, with him \u201cMaggie [was] laid out before the world, unafraid, unpopulated. Men come to insert themselves, they turn a girl into a city. When they leave, their residue remains, the discoloration on the wood where the sun came through every day for many days, until one day it didn\u2019t.\u201d\nMaggie said nothing for some time, until one day, she learned that Aaron Knodel was named North Dakota\u2019s Teacher of the Year.\nIt was then that she decided to step forward.\nIn this #MeToo era, you would expect the exact opposite to happen, i.e., everybody to believe her and deem Aaron the perpetrator without any evidence.\nBut this isn\u2019t Los Angeles or New York so what follows is something even worse, located on the other side of the spectrum> nobody believes Maggie. In fact, everybody starts talking about her as a \u201ccrazy and broken\u201d girl who wants nothing more than a payback and some money.\nThe fact that her relationship with Aaron started after she confided to him that she has had a relationship with another older man is used as evidence against her in court. Aaron\u2019s status\u2014popular and well-liked married man and teacher with children\u2014is enough to question almost everything Maggie says.\nThe final verdict?\nAaron is innocent, and he keeps his job.\nMaggie, on the other hand, is scarred for life. Because of her relationship with Aaron, she has dropped out of college and now works as a waitress, hardly the career she hoped for and dreamt of.\n\u201cThere are two Americas,\u201d concludes Taddeo, absolutely certain that Aaron is guilty and Maggie twice the victim. \u201cThere are men, and there are women, and one still rules the other in certain pockets of the country, in moments that are not televised. Even when women fight back, they must do it correctly. They must cry the right amount and look pretty but not hot.\u201d\nLina\nWe move to suburban Indiana to meet Lina, the second of the three women from the title, a homemaker and a mother of two.\u00a0\nThe thing she wanted the most in her life was to be desired by someone.\u00a0\nUnfortunately for her, she ended up being married to Ed, someone who, after ten years of marriage, doesn\u2019t like to kiss her anymore, because the sensation of someone else\u2019s tongue in his mouth \u201coffends\u201d him.\nLina loves her children, but almost nothing else about her life:\nOne day, Lina reconnects online with an old crush of hers: Aidan. Aidan was one of the popular guys at her school, \u201cstrong and hot and extremely quiet so that every time he opens his mouth it\u2019s exciting.\u201d\u00a0\nHowever, she lost him after one kiss and after she was basically sexually assaulted by three guys during a party that was not really a party (that\u2019s not how the story was told by the guys, though).\nNow, years later, Lina has no intention of letting him go. Though married with children of his own, Aidan, still \u201ca loaf of a man,\u201d reciprocates. The passion is real and knee-tingling and heart-drubbing. The passion overcomes Lina.\u00a0\nThe guy she shared her first kiss with is the guy who has now awoken her from her monotonous \u201csleeping maid marriage\u201d with another. And another. And another.\nEntirely physical, the affair goes on and on\u2014mostly on the backs of their cars and in hotel rooms. Even though Lina is very much aware that Aidan isn\u2019t as attached to this as she is, she doesn\u2019t mind: just like \n, Lina finds in this affair something more, something akin to sexual liberation.\nAnd she knows how much that has changed her.\n\u201cNot having a partner, for Lina, was like slowly, quietly dying,\u201d writes Taddeo. \u201cMaybe Aidan\u2026 would never leave his wife. Maybe none of the ways in which she\u2019d gilded him were accurate. But Aidan made her veins hot. He made her feel like a girl and not a part of the house. She could no longer see the end of her life clearly, she could no longer picture the grayness of the earth she would be buried under and the road the hearse would take to get her there. And that was more living than she\u2019d done in her whole life.\u201d\nSloane\nSloane is the pseudonym Taddeo uses instead of the name of a wealthy restaurateur in her early forties, thin and genuine with a face like a sorority girl and a very long, very beautiful hair the color of chestnuts.\nShe is married to a man named Richard, \u201cwho is not as handsome as she is beautiful.\u201d The two have two daughters, \u201cequine and vibrant like their mother; and a third child, Lila, Richard\u2019s daughter from his first relationship.\u201d\nThey live in Newport, on Rhode Island\u2019s Narragansett Bay, own a restaurant, and, as a family, are both \u201cbound very neatly\u201d and distant enough so that each member can be his or her own person.\nIt is this last thing that really changes everything one day, when, out of the blue, Karin, an employee at their restaurant, proposes Richard something indecent: a threesome. \u201cYou can propose that to Sloane, if you like,\u201d Richard, always the devoted husband, calmly replied.\nA few days later, Karin and Sloane spend a day together with each other, and they spend the night together with Richard. One thing leads to another and, before too long, the three engage in a sexual relationship. At first, Sloane has problems watching her husband inside another woman.\u00a0\nShe overcomes them the same night, but for Richard they become a character trait: soon after, he starts encouraging (even pressuring) his wife into relationships with other men. Sometimes, she describes him these affairs.

This is something we both did as a couple. It wasn\u2019t Sloane. She\u2019s not what you think.\u201d\nRichard didn\u2019t do that.\u00a0\nBut that didn\u2019t take away too much of Sloane\u2019s love for him.\nStrangely enough, as far as Sloane is concerned, \u201cthere is nothing more important than the fact that she wants her husband above all others, and he wants her above all else.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cThree Women\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Hypocrisies of the Heterosexual Marriage\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Scarred by the Male Gaze\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Persistence of Gender Inequality\nThe Hypocrisies of the Heterosexual Marriage\n\u201cMonogamy today,\u201d wrote \n in \u201cThe Overdue Demise of Monogamy,\u201d \u201ccompares with heterosexuality not too many decades ago, or tolerance of slavery 150 years ago.

Among the three women it portrays, the one who has something that is the closest to a happy marriage is Sloane, a middle-aged swinger who has threesomes with people chosen by her husband.\u00a0\nParadoxically, it is this subversion of marriage roles that seems to work better than traditional marriage or the notion of everlasting love for the women investigated by Taddeo.

And Why?\nIf you are one of the billions of people googling questions such as \u201cwhat is my purpose?\u201d or \u201cwhat is the meaning of life?\u201d \u2014 then this book will probably interest you.\nAlso, if you know and like Oprah and you feel that you can never have enough of her, then, really, is there any need for a recommendation?\nAbout Oprah Winfrey\n is an American talk show host, actress, and media executive, best known for \n, the highest-rated TV program of its kind in history.\nBorn and raised in poverty, Oprah became a co-anchor for the evening news already in her teenage years, after which she transferred to Chicago to become the host of \n. In just a few months, she made it the highest-rated talk show in the state and, as they say, the rest is history.\nIn addition to being one of the most famous women in the world, Oprah is also an Academy Award nominee for her role in \n, and one of the most generous philanthropists alive.\nIf you want to find out more, visit \n.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThe Path Made Clear PDF Summary\u201d\nIf you type in the question \u201cWhat is my purpose?\u201d in the Google search query and then press \u201cEnter,\u201d you\u2019ll get 2 \n responses!\n(Oprah says \u201cone billion,\u201d but we did the experiment, and it\u2019s actually twice as that!)\nThat means only one thing: it is in the nature of humans to ask themselves what they are doing on this planet, and it is not at all surprising that we all long for an existence that matters.\n\u201cOn the surface, typing those four little words\u00a0\u2026 \n and pressing Enter may seem trivial,\u201d writes Oprah, \u201cbut it\u2019s really a profound reflection of an intimate prayer rising from the deepest part of the heart. It\u2019s asking to be acknowledged. Initiating that search is a sign that the journey toward an elevated life filled with meaning and character is ready to begin.\u201d\nThe \n news?\nYour purpose is not something you need to look outside your own self. Because it is unique to your own existence: we are \n born with a God-given calling. All you have to do is follow your path to answer this call.\nOprah\u2019s hope with \n is \u201cto offer the wisdom of experience from the visionaries, artists, teachers, and trailblazers who have walked this road before you, and who have shared their inspiration and lessons with [her].\u201d\nThe common thread among them: \u201cThey have discovered that in this world, there is no real \n without first \n.\u201d\nThe Seeds\nIf you\u2019ve read your \n, you probably remember \u201cThe Parable of the Mustard Seed.\u201d It appears in all Gospels except that of John, but we\u2019ll quote it from Matthew (13:31-32):\n\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.\u201d\nOprah says that this was one of her favorite Bible parables.\nWhy?\nBecause it suggested that no matter how small or insignificant you are, anything is possible. \u201cAs a child,\u201d she writes, \u201clistening from my seat in church, this brought me so much comfort\u2014just as it did when I was struggling as a reporter in Baltimore and as it still does today.\u201d\nThe mustard seed is so small and, yet, in time, it grows into something so big and significant. The only thing you need to do is discover it, and let it grow inside you.\nOur lives are not static, she says: \u201cevery decision, setback, or triumph is an opportunity to identify the seeds of truth that make you the wondrous human being that you are.\u201d\nShe herself had an experience such as this.\nAs you know, she worked as a news anchor for several years in the early 1970s, and, then, in 1978 she was demoted to become a co-host of the talk show \nIt was then that she discovered her seed.\nYou can do it too: just pay attention to what feeds your energy. \u201cTrust that the Universe has a bigger, wider, deeper dream for you than you could ever imagine for yourself,\u201d concludes Oprah.\nThe Roots\nOprah doesn\u2019t believe in coincidences: she believes that there is a divine order to the magnificent mystery of our lives.\nAnd one of the things she enjoys most is watching someone experience an \n.\u00a0\nIn her mind, this \nmoment is proof that there\u2019s something deeply rooted within us, and that to experience the true joy you must tap into it. It\u2019s like a puzzle: sometimes the pieces just click, and you know that everything\u2019s going to be alright.\n\u201cWhatever your calling,\u201d Oprah writes, \u201cit\u2019s already rooted within you, and those roots can be trampled or tugged at but never removed. They grow stronger only when tended, nurtured\u2014and, most important, shared with others.\u201d\nOprah\u2019s deepest desire is to help people \n in the literal meaning of these words. The world would be much more beautiful, she thinks, if everybody does what he/she is born to do.\nWhen you align your personality with your purpose\u2014\n\u2014no one can touch you.\nThe Whispers\n\u201cPassion whispers to you through your feelings, beckoning you toward your highest good,\u201d writes Oprah at the beginning of this third chapter, quoting, well, herself (after all, she \n Oprah, and she \n do that!)\nShe experienced this herself when she was demoted.\nMany people would look at an event such as that as some kind of failure and do their best to get back where they had been before the demotion.\nNot Oprah: she just remembered to relax and see if this was some kind of a sign. The very first interview she had confirmed her initial suspicions: the demotion was a blessing in disguise.\n\u201cYour life is always speaking to you,\u201d says Oprah, noting that this is one of her most cherished spiritual principles, one that she has taken every opportunity to share with the world.\nLife speaks in whispers, she goes on, and these whispers are your guides to your next right step. They can take many forms: a shiver, a goose-bump, a pit in the stomach, a pause before you speak. And they can be positive, saying things such as \u201cI should do this. I \n ought to do this in life,\u201d or negative whispering sentences like \u201cHmm, something feels off\u201d or \u201cThis is no longer your place of belonging.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever form the whisper takes, it\u2019s not a coincidence. Your life is trying to tell you something,\u201d writes Oprah. \u201cHeeding these signs can open the doors to your personal evolution, pushing you toward your life\u2019s purpose. Ignoring them\u2014sleepwalking through your life\u2014is an invitation to chaos.\u201d\nThe Clouds\nWhen in 2013, Oprah Winfrey was invited to give a \n at Harvard\u2019s 362nd Commencement on May 30, 2013, at Tercentenary Theatre, for the first time in her long and successful career, she felt the fear of public speaking.\n\u201cI felt \n of pressure,\u201d she writes, \u201cthe kind of internal angst that makes you sit down at the computer to write, take one look at the empty screen, close the computer, and say, \n. Then worry about it more, set a deadline to work on it again, and, when the alarm goes off, find an excuse not to do it. You know how that goes.\u201d\nOprah\u2019s usual mantras in situations such as this are \u201cWhen you don\u2019t know what to do, do nothing and the answer will come\u201d and \u201cdoubt means \n\u201d\nHowever, no answer came even after a few weeks, and Oprah was more and more sure that it wasn\u2019t doubt that crippled her: it was fear\u2014fear that she had nothing new to tell to these brilliant Harvard minds.\nAnd then came her revelation!\n\u201cThe more important an activity is to your soul\u2019s evolution,\u201d said to her author Steven Pressfield during a conversation, \u201c\n.\u201d\nIn other words, fear and doubt stem not merely from the devilish voices inside you: they are sometimes resistance embodied. And resistance is the cloud that accompanies every dream.\nTo lift this cloud, turn your will and your desire into allies. \u201cYou get to decide. You get to declare, \n and confront the fear head-on,\u201d writes Oprah.\nThe Map\n\u201cWhen you want something,\u201d \n,\nall the Universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.\u201d\nOprah is a firm believer in this aphorism.\nHowever, she also feels the need to highlight that \n: \u201cthe variable between winning the race and faltering at the finish line,\u201d she writes, \u201clies with one of the guiding forces in my life: intention.\u201d\nIn other words, the Universe \nhelp you, but you have to be clear in your vision so as to not let it nudge you in the wrong direction.\nYou\u2019re not going to a new place without studying the map beforehand, right? Why should living and achieving your goals be any different?\nAnd committing to your course starts with a simple question: \u201cWhy?\u201d Why are you doing this? What is your real intention?\u00a0\nOnly then, you can move to the next question: \u201cHow will I execute the action?\u201d\nLeave the rest to the Universe.\nThe Road\nFeminist icon Gloria Steinem is one of the people Oprah believes are the truest expression of themselves.\nOnce, Gloria told Oprah her secret: she moved through life with such \u201crazor-sharp clarity\u201d because her mind is in a constant \u201con the road\u201d state.\nThis way of thinking, she said to Winfrey, reminds her to stay open to learning at all times, because travel \u201cbrings people out of their heads and into their hearts\u201d and offers the promise of expanding the truth.\u00a0\nThe \u201con the road\u201d philosophy makes you feel \u201cboundaryless, spontaneous, and at one with everything\u201d\u2014just like traveling when it\u2019s done properly.\nGloria compares this \u201con the road\u201d thinking mode to \u201ca bird in flight, riding on a current, perpetually focused on forward motion, at all times checking the direction of the wind, yet open to all possibilities.\u201d\nSomehow, birds let things go and still make things happen; and so do human beings when they adapt to this \u201con the road\u201d philosophy of life.\nThat\u2019s why, for Oprah, this philosophy is practically synonymous with the word Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi introduced a while ago: \n. Or, even better, it is synonymous with a phrase athletes have been using for decades: \u201cin the zone.\u201d\nTo describe it, they use phrases such as \u201ctunnel vision,\u201d \u201ccomplete calm,\u201d or \u201cultra-focus.\u201d \u201cSome liken it to a spiritual experience,\u201d says Oprah, \u201ca state of consciousness in which time feels like it has slowed down or completely fallen away.\u201d\nWhen you\u2019re in the zone, the road is clear in front of you, open, smooth and yours for the taking.\u00a0\nAnd as LeBron James himself told Oprah once, to be in the zone, all you need to do is stop playing for the others and start playing for yourself.\nThe Climb\n\u201cI have always thought a mountain is a magnificent metaphor for life,\u201d writes Oprah. \u201cFrom a distance, the ascent looks clear and smooth, but once you actually set out for the summit, you discover unexpected valleys and precarious ridges along the way. If your internal compass isn\u2019t set to keep climbing, every stumble will give you an excuse to turn back.\u201d\nBut you are not allowed excuses if your goal is to climb the mountain. Even when it is a steep and rocky road ahead of you, you must go forward\u2014and, thus, upward.\nStumbles are an inevitable part of any road, but they are also, sometimes, what makes the road worthwhile.\nOne of Oprah\u2019s favorite lessons coming from pastor \n is \u201cWhat follows \u2018I am\u2019 is what we\u2019re inviting into our life.\u201d\nIn other words, if you say things such as \u201cI am exhausted\u201d or \u201cI am overwhelmed\u201d that\u2019s inevitably what you\u2019ll become because \n.\nOprah felt this herself a few years back when she started building her OWN network (the Oprah Winfrey Network).\u00a0\nWhen she shifted her perspective from \u201cI am struggling\u201d to \u201cI am honored,\u201d suddenly everything changed: her climb was transformed \u201cfrom an arduous trek into a still challenging but now stimulating adventure.\u201d\nSince then, she looks at both stumbles and failures as teachers\u2014not as setbacks.\nThe Give\nOprah Winfrey considers Maya Angelou her \u201cspiritual queen mother\u201d and her \u201cultimate teacher.\u201d\nOnce the great poetess told her: \u201cPeople may not remember what you did or what you said, but they always remember how you made them feel.\u201d\nThis thought has resonated with Oprah ever since: it was the first time she realized that every single moment we have here on earth is an opportunity to be of service to other people.\n\u201cWhen you know, teach,\u201d said Maya Angelou. \u201cand when you get, give.\u201d\nHas something truer and more humane ever been said?\nThe Reward\nWe haven\u2019t gotten to summarizing it yet, but \n by Sarah Ban Breathnach was all the rage a decade ago.\nThe book\u2014a collection of evocative essays, one for each day of the year\u2014has sold seven million copies to this day and has been translated into more than 30 languages.\nWhat fascinates even more, it was Sarah Breathnach\u2019s debut!\nYou can imagine how much her life changed after \n: she became a multimillionaire practically overnight.\nThe problem with that: she didn\u2019t really know what to do with the money!\nShe hired nine assistants, bought eight pairs of Manolo Blahnik shoes in one trip, and even bought a chapel actually owned by Sir Isaac Newton once!\nFifteen years later, there she was\u2014talking to Oprah about losing it all.\n\u201cWhat I learned from Sarah and so many others,\u201d comments Oprah, \u201cis that the way people handle money reflects the way they see themselves. Many times when people win the lottery and experience a windfall, they don\u2019t see themselves as worthy of their newfound riches. They wind up spending on possessions to create an idea of self-worth. When you\u2019ve become blinded by the status symbols, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of the unique gifts only you can offer the world.\u201d\nOprah is not like that: she knows she isn\u2019t the salary she receives. Because she also knows that everything passes and changes with time.\nEverything, that is, but you\u2014who you are, what you are, and what you are meant to share with the world.\n\u201cThat is your true treasure,\u201d she concludes.\nHome\nHave you watched \n?\nOf course, you have: who hasn\u2019t!\nOprah thinks that the film (as well as the book, of course) is \u201cone of the great spiritual teachings of all time.\u201d\nWhy?\nBecause it illustrates perfectly the universal human coordinates of something, Joseph Campbell dubbed \u201c\n\u201d: the Yellow Brick Road represented nothing but Dorothy\u2019s path toward her true self.\nJust like many of us, Dorothy started her journey believing that she needs something outside herself to bestow the cherished virtues on her friends (a brain for Scarecrow, a heart for the Tin Man, and courage for the Cowardly Lion) and reach home.\nOf course, the truth is that all of her friends were \u201cthe disempowered parts of \n,\u201d and that the goal of her journey wasn\u2019t a place on the map, but a higher level of consciousness about her own existence.\nThat is why Oprah says, the most powerful scene in the film is when Glinda the Good Witch says \u201cthe words that spiritual teachers have been trying to convey for thousands of years:\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be helped any longer. You\u2019ve always had the power.\u201d\n\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you tell her before?\u201d asks the Scarecrow.\n\u201cBecause she wouldn\u2019t have believed me. She had to learn it for herself,\u201d answers Glinda.\nThis was the greatest \nmoment of Oprah\u2019s life: there is always a path home because you are always you.\nThat\u2019s the essence of Dorothy\u2019s words at the end:\n\u201cIf I ever go looking for my heart\u2019s desire again, I won\u2019t look any further than my own backyard. Because if it isn\u2019t there, I never really lost it, to begin with.\u201d\n\u201cYou already know,\u201d says Oprah in the epigraph.\nAnd, trust us, you do.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Path Made Clear\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Your Purpose Is Rooted Within You\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Listen to the Whispers and Climb the Mountain\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Goal of the Journey Is Not a Place, But a State of Mind\nYour Purpose Is Rooted Within You\nWhatever your calling, Oprah says, it is already rooted within you, in the way Buck\u2019s calling to become something more of a dog was rooted within him even when he was the most obedient and loyal sled dog in Thornton\u2019s camp.\nMeaning: no matter how much you\u2019ve strayed from your purpose, it will always be there inside you, waiting to be discovered and grasped.\nYour purpose grows stronger when tended and shared with other people\u2014so start doing that right now.\nListen to the Whispers and Climb the Mountain\nDon\u2019t really know your purpose?\nDon\u2019t worry!\nLife is whispering it to you all the time!\nIt may be the goosebumps, the fire in your eyes or your belly, or, simply, the gut feeling that something\u2019s off. Be they positive or negative, these are all \n, body signals which nudge you in the right direction, toward the top of the mountain.\nBecause that\u2019s what life is: climbing a mountain and overcoming all obstacles. Not using the latter as excuses.\u00a0\nThe Goal of the Journey Is Not a Place, But a State of Mind\nThis is the essence of most spiritual teachings ever devised: what you want the most, you already have within you.\nYou just need to discover it.\nMaterial gains, fame, property\u2014all of these things are just surrogates, substitutes about \n. And to discover that something else, you need nothing but attention and awareness.\nThe holy mountain isn\u2019t located in the distance: it is buried deep inside your heart.s\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Path Made Clear Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nA collection of quotes, conversations, and real-life anecdotes\u2014all framed within Oprah\u2019s ever-wise words and neatly structured into ten aptly titled chapters that simulate one\u2019s journey to self-discovery\u2014\nis Oprah at her best\u2014which is precisely what we have grown accustomed to expecting from her.\nIn addition to Oprah\u2019s thoughts and illuminating pieces of advice on all sorts and topics, on these pages you\u2019ll find words of wisdom from everyone from \n to \n, from Lin-Manuel Miranda to Jay-Z, as these renowned men and women \u201cshare the greatest lessons from their own journeys toward a life filled with purpose.\u201d\nAnd it should be easier to walk the path toward self-discovery with their help, shouldn\u2019t it?"},

And Why?\nWe\u2019ll allow the authors to answer these questions:\nAre you open to at least thinking about a different approach to discipline? One that helps you achieve your immediate goals of getting your kids to do the right thing in the moment, as well as your longer-range goals of helping them become good people who are happy, successful, kind, responsible, and even self-disciplined?\nIf so, this book is for you.\nAbout Daniel J. Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson\n, M.D., is an acclaimed author, award-winning educator, executive director of the Mindsight Institute, and clinical professor of psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine. \ninternationally renowned, he is the author of several highly praised bestselling books, such as \n, \n, and \n.\nFind out more at \n. \n is a psychotherapist.\nShe is also the Founder/Executive Director of The Center for Connection, and of The Play Strong Institute.\nSo far, she has co-authored three books with Siegel: \n, \nand \nThe fourth collaboration of the two (\n) should be published in 2020.\nFind out more at \n \n\u201cNo-Drama Discipline PDF Summary\u201d\nYesterday, we told you something about \n; and the day before that, we allowed Esther Wojcicki to teach you \n.\nWell, consider this book the illegitimate child of the two: it is Daniel Siegel teaching parents how to discipline their children.\nIntroduction: Relational, Low-Drama Discipline: Encouraging Cooperation While Building a Child\u2019s Brain\nThe word \u201cdiscipline\u201d comes directly from the Latin word \n, which was used as far back as the eleventh century to mean teaching, learning, and giving instruction.\nAfter all, the root of the word \u201cdiscipline\u201d is \n, which means \u201cstudent,\u201d \u201cpupil,\u201d and \u201clearner.\u201d\nHowever, for modern parents, the word discipline seems to have taken another meaning, as in the sentence: \u201cI\u2019m doing a lot of teaching with Sam, but when do I start disciplining him?\u201d\nBut when your child misbehaves, what do you want to accomplish through your actions? Is spanking the objective or should spanking merely teach him/her a lesson about something else? Surely, it is the latter: the objective of discipline is still not merely \n, but \n.\nNow, there\u2019s a problem with this: as practically any parent you\u2019ve ever met would tell you, it doesn\u2019t really work.\nThe good news?\nWell, unlike previous generations, we now have better models for disciplining \u2013 in the right sense of the word. And this is because we now know that \u201cthe way to help a child develop optimally is to help create connections in her brain\u2014her whole brain\u2014that develop skills that lead to better relationships, better mental health, and more meaningful lives.\u201d\nPut simply, our words and actions quite literally change the behavior of our children, and that\u2019s because our children\u2019s brains will \n change because of them.\nAnd that\u2019s the goal of the no-drama discipline advocated by Daniel J. Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson. It\u2019s a model of parenting which revolves around the motto \u201csay no to the behavior, but yes to the child\u201d via a very simple \u201cconnect and redirect\u201d strategy.\nIt\u2019s time to say goodbye to the act-react disciplining cycle!\nRead ahead to learn how!\nChapter 1: ReTHINKING Discipline\nAs we said above, the word \u201cpunishment\u201d shouldn\u2019t be synonymous with \u201cdiscipline.\u201d \nParadoxically, that is precisely the reason why Siegel and Bryson chose it: they wanted to reframe the whole discussion, to reclaim the word \u201cdiscipline\u201d along with its original meaning, to inspire caregivers to start thinking of discipline as \u201cone of the most loving and nurturing things\u201d they can do for kids.\nAnd the first lesson is this: there\u2019s no such thing as one-size-fits-all discipline.\nReally, you ask? What about spanking and time-outs? They have stood the test of time and have been around since the dawn of times!\nWell, the reason why spanking and time-outs have stood the test of time is pretty much synonymous with the problem: these are autopilot reactions.\nIn other words, if your child misbehaves, the very first words that come to your mind are \u201cGo to your room and think about this;\u201d if it\u2019s something more serious, then you skip the words and proceed to the spanking; sometimes, it\u2019s both.\nEither way, it\u2019s not rocket science: it\u2019s the very basic, most primitive reactions available at your disposal.\nThe problem is that this inspires your kid to do the same; his/her action causes an immediate reaction of yours; your reaction, in turn, causes your child to autopilot-react as well.\nThat\u2019s why it never actually learns anything.\nThere\u2019s a better way, of course!\nInstead of reacting\u2014lecturing, spanking, timing-out\u2014you could just take a moment and ask yourself three simple questions:\n#1. Why did my child act this way?\n#2. What lesson do I want to teach in this moment?\n#3. How can I best teach this lesson?\nSince every child and situation are different, the answers will differ from case to case. \nBut, after all, that is pretty much the point!\nChapter 2: Your Brain on Discipline\nHave you ever heard of the phrase \u201cneurons that fire together, wire together\u201d? \nIf not, it describes something \n, according to which \u201cwhen neurons fire simultaneously in response to an experience, those neurons become connected to each other, forming a network. And when an experience is repeated over and over, it deepens and strengthens the connections among those neurons.\u201d\nThis is colloquially known as neuroplasticity and has enormous ramifications in terms of parenting.\nBecause, as Siegel and Bryson note, \u201cif repeated experiences actually change the physical architecture of the brain, then it becomes paramount that we be intentional about the experiences we give our children.\u201d\nLet\u2019s illustrate this a bit better.\nLiz and Tim have two children: Vera, a seven-year-old, and Nina, a four-year-old. For convenience\u2019 sake, it makes sense for Tim to take Nina to school and Liz\u2014Vera.\nHowever, one day, Nina rebels: \u201cYou took Vera yesterday! I want you to take \n today.\u201d Liz tries to explain away her reasons: \u201cI know, sweetheart. That\u2019s because Vera\u2019s school is right by my work.\u201d\nThis, expectedly, doesn\u2019t get to Nina and, in a few minutes, the situation boils over: after a few shouts and screams\u2014and maybe even a slap\u2014Nina is forced to go with Tim and cries all the way to school, and Liz\u2019s day is ruined from the morning.\nWhat Liz should have done?\nFirstly, she should have asked herself the three questions introduced above. Secondly, she should have hugged Nina. Finally, she should have offered her a choice: she can go to school alone or with her dad.\nWhy this would work?\nBecause spanking and shouting engage the downstairs brain (the amygdala); and it doesn\u2019t learn. Hugs and thinking, on the other hand, engage the upstairs brain; it learns and changes.\nChapter 3: From Tantrum to Tranquility: Connection Is the Key\nBefore going on, let\u2019s sum up the things discussed so-far in merely a few sentences.\nScience has taught us that our children\u2019s brains are \n, \n, and \n. In simplified terms, they consist of two sections: the downstairs brain, and the upstairs brain. The downstairs brain is the reptilian one; the upstairs the human one.\nNow, most parenting techniques are \n: they are merely reactions to some actions, and engage the downstairs brain of the child; thus, they encourage him/her to counteract.\nThere\u2019s a better way!\nIt\u2019s called \n parenting, and it consists of two steps: connecting and redirecting. Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 analyze the art of parent/child connecting.\nNow, \nconnecting?\nFor three reasons:\n#1. Connection moves a child from reactivity to receptivity\n#2. Connection builds the brain\n#3. Connection deepens the relationship with a child\nAnd this is true even in the worst-case scenarios, i.e., tantrums:\nChapter 4: No-Drama Connection in Action\nNow, that\u2019s connection in theory. \nThis is how it looks in practice.\nFirst, let us look over three No-Drama connection principles that set the stage and allow for connection between parent and child.\nRemember the sound of \n? \nPlay it over a video depicting a man walking through a beautiful forest to the ocean, and the peaceful scene would suddenly become more than threatening!\nWell, that\u2019s exactly how phrases such as \u201cGo to your room!\u201d \u201cBecause I said so!\u201d or \u201cHere we go again\u201d sound to your child. How about switching to something more akin to \u201cYou seem disappointed about this grade\u201d?\n\u201cOne of the worst by-products of shark music,\u201d write Siegel and Bryson, \u201cis the parental tendency to make assumptions about what we perceive to be obvious.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes would be the first to differ: \u201cIt is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data,\u201d she famously says. \u201cInsensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.\u201d\nSo, instead of blaming and criticizing (\u201cWhat did you do this time?\u201d), you should instead consider chasing the deep and profound \n (\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d \u201cI wonder what you two were aiming for this time!\u201d)\nThe third connection principle focuses on the way you \n interact with your children. \nIt challenges you to consider the way you talk to your kids when they\u2019re having trouble managing themselves or making good decisions. \n you say to your kids is, of course, important. But you know that just as important, if not more important, is \n you say it.\nIn other words, even orders such as \u201cGet in your car seat!\u201d if told with a Jim Carrey voice and a Monster-Mash face, can sound wacky and alluring!\nThe No-Drama Connection Cycle looks something like this:\nLet\u2019s see what it means in practice.\nCommunicating comfort is the basic (and, in most cases, the foremost) connection strategy; it is primarily non-verbal and, most powerfully, it is expressed through a loving touch.\nWhen your child is sad for missing a playdate, you shouldn\u2019t react the way you\u2019re automatically inclined to \u2013 by dismissing the importance of the event. On the contrary, in fact: you must validate it before moving on with the other strategies. In other words, instead of saying, \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal about missing a playdate?\u201d say, \u201cI understand that you\u2019re sad. You really wanted to go.\u201d\nThis one\u2019s pretty much self-explanatory: talking often compounds the problem; so, be quiet for some time and just listen.\nReflecting what you hear is similar to validating, but it differs in that in the fourth connection strategy, you focus specifically on what your kids have actually told you. \nChapter 5: 1-2-3 Discipline: Redirecting for Today, and for Tomorrow\nNow, that you\u2019ve learned how to \n with your child, it is time to learn how to redirect his/her behavior in the desired direction.\nIn \u201cChapter 5,\u201d Siegel and Bryson go over the redirection basics, helping readers remember one definition of discipline (to teach), two key principles (wait until your child is ready, and be consistent but not rigid), and three desired outcomes (insight, empathy, and repair).\nNo-Drama Discipline is all about teaching, and that is because all discipline \n be about teaching, and not about consequences.\nSo, instead of immediately giving consequences (\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve stolen my cigarettes! No going out for a month!\u201d), you should initiate a conversation (\u201cCan you tell me something more about my cigarettes?\u201d)\nOnly in the second case, you can hope that you and your child will learn something; in the first case, things might just go worse, because \u201cdownstairs-brain reactions\u201d breed \u201cdownstairs-brain reactions.\u201d It\u2019s as simple as that.\nThe two main principles when redirecting your kids encourage cooperation and make life easier for both your children and you. \nThese principles are #1: wait until your child is ready, and #2: be consistent, but not rigid.\nIn essence, they mean that you shouldn\u2019t rush anything and that instead of rigidly commanding and demanding (\u201cYou can\u2019t talk to me that way! You\u2019re in a lot of trouble now!\u201d) you should give your child practice doing the right thing (\u201cLet\u2019s have a do-over. I know you can say that again in a more respectful way.\u201d)\nIf you\u2019ve read Dan Siegel\u2019s \nand\n, you\u2019re already familiar with this simple equation: insight + empathy = mindsight.\nIn other words, \u201cwhen we ask our children to consider their own feelings (using personal \n) while also imagining how someone else might experience a particular situation (using \n), we are helping them develop mindsight.\u201d\nYou can learn more about mindsight if you read the summaries linked above, but, explained most simply, \u201cmindsight is the ability to see our own mind, as well as the mind of another. It allows us to develop meaningful relationships while also maintaining a healthy and independent sense of self.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s what you\u2019re aiming with your kid, aren\u2019t you?\nChapter 6: Addressing Behavior: As Simple as R-E-D-I-R-E-C-T\nChapter 6 \u201cconcentrates on specific redirection strategies you can use for achieving the immediate goal of eliciting cooperation in the moment, and for teaching kids about personal insight, relational empathy, and taking steps toward making good choices.\u201d\nSiegel and Bryson have made an effort to organize these strategies in an acronym which spells their goal: R-E-D-I-R-E-C-T.\nThe last thing a child needs is a long lecture about their mistakes; so, resist the urge to overtalk.\n\u201cWe want to say yes to our kids\u2019 desires,\u201d write Siegel and Bryson, \u201ceven when we need to say no to their behavior and redirect them toward appropriate action.\u201d \nSo, don\u2019t squelch emotions saying things like \u201cI know you don\u2019t hate your brother;\u201d say something like \u201cOK, you feel like you hate your brother, but let\u2019s talk about other ways to express this.\u201d\nWhat kids need is for their parents to redirect them, \u201chelping them recognize the bad decisions they\u2019re making and what leads up to those decisions, so they can correct themselves and change whatever needs to be changed.\u201d\nIn other words, instead of preaching along the lines \u201cIf everyone put the shoes at the front door, it would be a mess: put your shoes away,\u201d use a mere description which says even more under the surface: \u201cI see shoes at the front door.\u201d\n\u201cWhen children are involved in the process of discipline,\u201d inform Siegel and Bryson, \u201cthey feel more respected, they buy into what the parents are promoting, and they are therefore more apt to cooperate and even help come up with solutions to the problems that created the need for discipline in the first place.\u201d\nThe lesson: parents and children should work as a team to figure out how best to address disciplinary situations.\nThat starts with a \nwhich doesn\u2019t start with \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing and saying,\u201d but with a question: \u201cWhat could you do next time you\u2019re mad?\u201d\nMost parents use a \u201cno\u201d even though a \u201cconditional yes\u201d is also a possibility and \n helps. Transform the \u201cNo, we can\u2019t stay\u201d into \u201cOf course you can have more time with Nana,\u201d with a simple time-conditioned question: \u201cHow about this weekend?\u201d\nWe all know how to scold negative behavior, but very few of us really encourage positive traits in our children.\nAnd it\u2019s fairly easy to do that: just catch your kid behaving well, and emphasize that to create synaptic networks inside her/his brain.\nRemember: your kids are \n; in other words, they like games more than almost anything in the world.\nSo, start masking the orders (i.e., the things they \n do) into games (i.e., playful, creative ways to spend the time).\nNeed an idea?\nHow about, instead of saying \u201cGet in your car seat right now!\u201d you say something like \u201cPlease, please don\u2019t sit in that car seat because Jimmy Jimmerino is already sitting there!\u201d\nOf course, Jimmy Jimmerino is your imaginary friend (who, we feel, will make quite a few appearances along the way).\nThe final redirection strategy, say Siegel and Bryson, is perhaps the most revolutionary. \nWhy?\nBecause it involves you teaching your children the things they taught you throughout this book.\nThink of it this way: the earlier your child learns to tell the difference between downstairs and upstairs brain, the earlier it too can become an active participant in the No-Drama Discipline school of parenting.\nThat will certainly allow you to skip a few steps.\nConclusion: On Magic Wands, Being Human, Reconnection, and Change: Four Messages of Hope\nThe book\u2019s concluding chapter offers four messages of hope intended to help you take the pressure off yourself as you discipline.\nThese are:\n#1. There Is No Magic Wand\n#2. Your Kids Benefit Even When You Mess Up\n#3. You Can Always Reconnect\n#4. It\u2019s Never Too Late to Make a Positive Change\nDon\u2019t forget these four messages of hope and solace\u2014especially not in those difficult moments you\u2019ll inevitably face at one time or another as you discipline your children.\n\u201cEven with the best ambitions and the most intentional methods,\u201d conclude Siegel and Bryson, \u201csometimes everyone walks away from a disciplinary interaction feeling angry, confused, and frustrated.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cNo-Drama Discipline\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Twenty Discipline Mistakes Even Great Parents Made\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Eight Basic Principles of No-Drama Discipline\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Connect and Redirect Refrigerator Sheet\nTwenty Discipline Mistakes Even Great Parents Made\nKeeping these twenty mistakes in mind can help us to avoid them or to step back when we start heading down the low parenting road:\n#1. Our discipline becomes consequence-based instead of teaching-based.\n#2. We think that if we\u2019re disciplining, we can\u2019t be warm and nurturing.\n#3. We confuse consistency with rigidity.\n#4. We talk too much.\n#5. We focus too much on the behavior and not enough on the why behind the behavior.\n#6. We forget to focus on how we say what we say.\n#7. We communicate that our kids shouldn\u2019t experience big or negative feelings.\n#8. We overreact, so our kids focus on our overreaction, not their own actions.\n#9. We don\u2019t repair.\n#10. We lay down the law in an emotional, reactive moment, then realize we\u2019ve overreacted.\n#11. We forget that our children may sometimes need our help making good choices or calming themselves down.\n#12. We consider an audience when disciplining.\n#13. We get trapped in power struggles.\n#14. We discipline in response to our habits and feelings instead of responding to our individual child in a particular moment.\n#15. We embarrass our kids by correcting them in front of others.\n#16. We assume the worst before letting our kids explain.\n#17. We dismiss our kids\u2019 experience.\n#18. We expect too much.\n#19. We let \u201cexperts\u201d trump our own instincts.\n#20. We\u2019re too hard on ourselves.\nThe Eight Basic Principles of No-Drama Discipline\nIf you want to avoid the twenty mistakes above, you need to start practicing the no-drama discipline, which is founded upon eight basic principles:\n#1. Discipline is essential.\n#2. Effective discipline depends on a loving, respectful relationship between adult and child.\n#3. The goal of discipline is to teach.\n#4. The first step in discipline is to pay attention to kids\u2019 emotions.\n#5. When children are upset or throwing a fit, that\u2019s when they need us most.\n#6. Sometimes we need to wait until children are ready to learn.\n#7. The way we help them be ready to learn is to connect with them.\n#8. After connecting, we redirect.\nThe Connect and Redirect Refrigerator Sheet\nDon\u2019t really understand #7 and #8 above? Well, that\u2019s really what \nis all about! And this is its brief summary:\n\u2022 \n\u201d: Let go of the background noise caused by past experiences and future fears.\n\u2022 \n: ask yourself \u201cWhy is my child acting this way? What is my child communicating?\u201d\n\u2022 \n: \n you say is important. \n you say it is even more important.\n\u2022 \n: By getting below your child\u2019s eye level, then giving a loving touch, a nod of the head, or an empathic look, you can often quickly defuse a heated situation.\n\u2022 \n: Even when you don\u2019t like the behavior, acknowledge and embrace feelings.\n\u2022 \n: When your child\u2019s emotions are exploding, don\u2019t explain, lecture, or try to talk her out of her feelings. Just listen, looking for the meaning and emotions your child is communicating.\n\u2022 \n: Once you\u2019ve listened, reflect back what you\u2019ve heard, letting your kids know you\u2019ve heard them. That leads back to communicating comfort, and the cycle repeats.\n\u2022 \n: Discipline is teaching. \n\u2022 \n \n: 1. Wait until your child is ready (and you are, too); 2. Be consistent but not rigid.\n\u2022 \n: 1. Insight: Help kids understand their own feelings and their responses to difficult situations; 2. Empathy: Give kids practice reflecting on how their actions impact others; 3.

And Why?\nis precisely that\u2014in at least one meaning of the word. It is Ben Shapiro\u2019s take on history from the position of a conservative, right-wing political commentator.\nYou yourself decide whether it is right in the other meaning of the word. But \nread it\u2014especially if you don\u2019t agree with Shapiro\u2019s views.\nBecause, let\u2019s face it, that\u2019s the only way one can burst his/her own filter bubble and, well, grow up.\nAbout Ben Shapiro\n is an American lawyer, author, and conservative political commentator.\nHe became a nationally syndicated columnist as a teenager\u2014the youngest in the history of the United States. \nEditor-in-chief for \nand editor-at-large of \n(2012\u20142016), Shapiro is also known as the host of \n.\nHe has so far written ten books.\n\u201cThe Right Side of History PDF Summary\u201d\nIntroduction\n\u201cThis book is about two mysteries,\u201d says Ben Shapiro in the \u201cIntroduction\u201d to \n, and\nstraight off the bat, lists them: \u201cThe first mystery: Why are things so good? The second mystery: Why are we blowing it?\u201d\nRegarding the first question, you already know the main facts: fewer people are dying, most babies can survive and live up to 80, fewer people than ever are hungry and uneducated.\nIn short, \u201cwe don\u2019t live in a perfect world, but we do live in the best world that has ever existed\u201d (\n). Most of Ben Shapiro\u2019s book attempts to understand how did this all happen.\nThe other part\u2014the more political one, perhaps\u2014is concerned with the question: \u201cWhy are we throwing it away?\u201d\nThere have never been more depressed people in history, we are killing ourselves at the highest rates ever, facts have made way for feelings, \n\u2014to name just a few of the banes of our present-day world.\nWhat in the world happened?\nThere are four main theories: heightened economic divides, reopening of racial wounds, technologically created filter bubbles and tunnel visions, and/or, for whatever reason, human nature has kicked back in.\nShapiro believes that neither of these theories explains away enough because all of them are offered independent of the first question: how did our world come to be.\n\u201cI believe these two questions are intimately related,\u201d he writes. \u201cThis book argues that Western civilization, including our modern notions of values and reason and science, was built on deep foundations. And this book argues that we\u2019re tossing away what\u2019s best about our civilization because we\u2019ve forgotten that those foundations even exist.\u201d\nChapter 1: The Pursuit of Happiness\nIn the \n, Aristotle noted that happiness is the only thing that humans desire for their own sake. In other words, even when people want honor, money, health, friendship, or romantic love\u2014they want it so that they can be happy.\nAnd, in a way, nobody has ever disagreed: according to most philosophers, happiness is the ultimate objective of every human being.\nThere\u2019s a problem with that sentence, however!\nNamely, just like the word \u201csilly\u201d\u2014which originally meant \n\u2014the word \u201chappiness\u201d itself has lost the meaning it had for Aristotle and the Ancient Civilizations. For us, happiness is basically akin to pleasure: golf, fishing, playing with your children, sex\u2014these are all things that make you happy.\nBut, for many people, so do drinking, drugs, infidelity\u2014to name just a few of the least amoral activities.\nWell, Aristotle didn\u2019t confuse happiness with pleasure. For him, a happy person was a person who has fulfilled its moral purpose, i.e., a good person.\nThink of it this way: a watch is good if it shows the right time to the second; if it doesn\u2019t, then it\u2019s broken. According to Aristotle, the same holds true for men, as well.\nSolomon agrees: \u201cThere is nothing better for a person than to rejoice in his work because that is his lot.\u201d (Ecclesiastes 3:22)\nAnd\u2014as we\u2019ve noted many times\u2014so does Viktor Frankl, who wrote in \n: \n\u201cWoe to him who saw no more sense in his life, no aim, no purpose, and therefore no point in carrying on. He was soon lost\u2026 We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that \n.\u201d\nChapter 2: From the Mountaintop\n\u201cThe revelation at Sinai, in approximately 1313 BCE according to traditional Biblical belief, changed the world by infusing it with meaning for those who knew the story,\u201d writes Ben Shapiro.\nIn other words, before Moses discovered God, humans were a plaything of the gods and of nature; afterward, suddenly, humans were granted both individual and communal purpose.\nJudaism did this through four faith-based claims which Shapiro says were \u201cutterly different from the pagan religions before\u201d:\n#1. God is unified, and there is a master plan behind everything;\n#2. Human beings are judged by moral, and not utilitarian standards (i.e., even if some things don\u2019t benefit you on earth, they might after you die); \n#3. History progresses, and man has a responsibility to pursue God through all times and circumstances;\n#4. God has endowed man with a free will, and therefore human choices matter.\nChristianity took the messages of Judaism and broadened these four tenets. However, even though it focused more heavily on grace, it successfully spread these four fundamental principles of Judaism to billions of human beings across the planet.\nAnd that made all the difference, according to Shapiro.\nWhich is why, he thinks, doing away with religion is synonymous with doing away with the things we call \u201cWestern values.\u201d\nJudeo-Christian religion is not antirational or backward\u2014it is the prerogative to progress and the very existence of Western societies; true enlightenment, \n, doesn\u2019t rest on the destruction of the Judeo-Christian heritage; it \n the Judeo-Christian heritage.\nChapter 3: From the Dust\nThe Bible gave humanity a God, an objective to strive for; the Greeks made humans Gods, turning the understanding of the true nature of God\u2014Nature\u2014into an objective.\nThe classical roots of Western civilization in Athens still have much to teach us,\u201d says Shapiro. \u201cAthens teaches us what we are capable of doing as human beings. Athens teaches us that we have the ability to use our reason to reach beyond ourselves. Athens teaches us not only how liberty can flourish, but why it should.\u201d\nIn Chapter 2, we saw that without Jerusalem, there could be no West; without Athens, adds Shapiro, the same holds true.\nAnd it\u2019s easy to see why: the Greeks were the first to truly understand the capacity of our brains and the fact that our brains are really what sets us apart from the animals. Consequently, they were the first to attempt to formulate the laws of the universe, believing it to be created by all-knowing Gods.\nIn a way, the Greeks didn\u2019t believe\u2014like the Hebrews\u2014that God is imperceptible; on the contrary, they attempted to understand how his mind worked when he created the universe.\nThis thinking gave as many benefits: geography, history, mathematics, and, perhaps, most important of all, democracy. \nIn Athens, for the first time in history, people started thinking of political systems which would allow everybody a vote.\nChapter 4: Coming Together\n\u201cThe worlds of Jerusalem and Athens seemed largely irreconcilable,\u201d writes Shapiro at the beginning of the fourth chapter.\n\u201cJudaism was a small but important religion\u2014estimates suggest that perhaps 10 percent of the Roman Empire was Jewish by the end of the first century CE\u2014and Greek thought had largely been subsumed within the rubric of Roman thought. But the two building blocks of Western civilization, Judaic revelation and Greek reasoning, were at war.\u201d\nThere were three serious conflicts between Jewish thought and Greek thought:\n\u201cWhere Judaism posited an active God in the universe,\u201d writes Shapiro, \u201cGreek thought posited an Unmoved Mover largely unconcerned with human affairs.\u201d\nGod stood behind creation in both cases; but unlike Greek reason, Judaism also saw God\u2019s presence in human events, not merely nature. \nFor Judaists, God was intimately involved with man\u2019s action; for the Greeks, fate explained much more than \u201cdivine presence with a moral sense.\u201d\nAs we said above, the Greeks sought universality in all things\u2014and they firmly believed that they were capable of finding it. \nJudaism, on the other hand, set a limit on human capacity: it believed that there are some truths known only to God, and these can be communicated to humans only through revelations.\nFinally, the Greeks were committed to the polis; the Jewish to the divine.\nIn other words, the Greeks wanted to shape individuals to best serve society as citizens; Judaism wanted to commit them both individually and collectively to the Divine Law.\nApparently irreconcilable, Judaism and Greek thought were brought together and found some consonance in Christianity, which provided the next layer of foundational ideas in the building of modernity.\nChapter 5: Endowed by Their Creators\nNow, contrary to what you believe\u2014and what the four riders of the modern atheistic movement would have you believe\u2014Christianity and science worked pretty well together for long stretches of time:\nTo mention just a few examples: \n\u2022 Nicole Oresme (1320\u20131382), bishop of Lisieux and the discoverer of the Earth\u2019s rotation about its axis;\n\u2022 Nicholas of Cusa (1401\u20131464), cardinal of Brixen who first theorized that the Earth was not stationary, but moved through space.\n\u2022 Finally, Nicolaus Copernicus whose \n included a letter to Pope Paul III.\nThe problem actually arose because of Martin Luther and John Calvin, after which the Church became suspicious of where the inclusion of secular knowledge would lead to.\nThat\u2019s why it persecuted Galileo, who, despite this, didn\u2019t lose his faith; on the contrary, he believed that it was his religious duty to find God through science.\n\u201cGalileo was no exception,\u201d notes Shapiro. \u201cHe was a representative of the rule: religious men saw a duty to examine the universe, and to do so with the best possible methodology. This philosophy permeated the wisdom of the Enlightenment\u2019s greatest scientists.\u201d\n(Yup, that\u2019s another jab at Pinker; the blows become ever more visible throughout the book until he is called out by name.)\nAnother deeply religious Christian mentioned in this chapter is John Locke, the man who basically invented modern freedom.\nLocke believed that our rights are a corollary of our duties: we have \n since we have a corresponding duty not to steal; \n, since we have a duty not to kill; and \n since we have a duty not to oppress.\nGovernments\u2019 only job was to protect these rights; if it doesn\u2019t, he argued, the citizens have the right to overthrow it.\nChapter 6: Killing Purpose, Killing Capacity\nAs you probably know, John Locke is one of the heroes of the Enlightenment, a period of history which modern proponents of progress (read: Steven Pinker et al.) think of as the pinnacle of civilization and Western values.\nThis was the period, they say when humanity finally got rid of the Baconian idols of the cave and started seeing the world as it is. Locke, Spinoza, Hume, Voltaire, Kant\u2014they all thought the way a human being should think, i.e., bereaved of the burden of a God, and aware that everything\u2019s been done via humankind\u2019s very own mental capacities and abilities.\nFurthermore, these advocates of Enlightenment values argue, it is religion which prevents us from making another step forward.\nAccording to Shapiro, \u201cthese claims are manifestly false.\u201d Even more, he says: we can learn from history that whenever we\u2019ve tried to build a society on reason only, we\u2019ve failed\u2014and miserably, to say the least. \nPeople like \n, \n, and Spinoza started questioning (parts of) the Judeo-Christian narrative, and this gave birth to moral relativism, culminating in David Hume\u2019s philosophy.\nThis, finally, resulted in the (at least) nominally atheistic (and, oftentimes, hedonistic) philosophies of Voltaire, Kant, and Bentham who assumed that reason could construct morality from scratch. \nBut the very fact that their moralities did not coincide should be evidence in favor of the opposite. Shapiro goes even further: \u201cpractically speaking, their morality lifted elements, even if unconsciously, from the Judeo-Christian tradition and Greek telos they suggested they had exploded.\u201d\nSpeaking of explosions\u2014\n, advocating for a world where humans live in accordance with the will of self-perfection.\nOf course, there was Dostoyevsky warning that \n\u2014but nobody listened.\nAnd then this happened.\nChapter 7: The Remaking of the World\nThe idea that we can all be reasonable and supplant traditional Judeo-Christian ideas with things like tolerance and compassion is a vestige of the Enlightenment mentality.\nUnfortunately, this idea ignores the dark side of the Enlightenment hope: the French and the Communist Revolutions. (We\u2019re not even going to talk about the Nazis\u2014you know that part too well.)\nThe Enlightenment, in Shapiro\u2019s \n, had two strains: one based on Athens and Jerusalem, the other bereft of them. \nThe first one is the American Enlightenment, \u201cbased on the consummation of a long history of thought stretching back to Athens and Jerusalem, down through Great Britain and the Glorious Revolution, and to the New World.\u201d\nThe second one was the European Enlightenment, \u201cwhich rejected Athens and Jerusalem in order to build new worlds beyond discoverable purpose and divine revelation.\u201d\nIn practice:\nIn the Declaration of Independence (founded upon the philosophy of Aristotle, Cicero, Locke, Sidney, etc.), the rights of man are given to him by God. \nThe French Declaration, on the other hand, made no mention of a transcendental presence: \u201cThe principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation. No body nor individual may exercise any authority which does not proceed directly from the nation.\u201d\nThe result?\nThe Home of the Brave and the Land of the Free in the first case; the guillotine and 250,000 dead in the latter one.\nThat\u2019s godless reasoning for you, right there!\nWell, you know this story quite well.\nIt starts with Karl Marx embracing the values of the French Revolution: \u201cThe gigantic broom of the French Revolution\u2026 swept away all these relics\u2026 \u00a0thus, clearly simultaneously the social soil of its last hindrances to the superstructure of the modern state edifice.\u201d\nAccording to Marx, even though the French Revolution didn\u2019t end in a communist utopia, it was the first step toward the gradual evolution of markets toward communism.\nOne of the obstacles toward the realization of this evolution was religion: \u201cThe abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is a demand for their true happiness,\u201d he wrote in the \n.\nVladimir Lenin embraced Marx\u2019s beliefs and in 1917, created the first socialist country in the world, which, in his words, was supposed to be the first \n democratic state. \n\u201cSounding a lot like Bernie Sanders,\u201d Shapiro informs us, \u201cLenin wrote in 1917, \u2018Democracy for an insignificant minority, democracy for the rich\u2014that is the democracy of capitalist society.\u201d\nLenin\u2019s democracy, however\u2014the democracy for the majority of the people\u2014had to come at a cost. \nGrigory Zinoviev, for example, one of the original members of the Politburo (later to be executed by Stalin), bragged about the launch of the so-called Red Terror: \u201cWe must carry along with us 90 million out of the 100 million of Soviet Russia\u2019s inhabitants. As for the rest, we have nothing to say to them. They must be annihilated.\u201d\nA death sentence on 10 million human beings; just like that.\n?\nChapter 8: After the Fire\nIn Chapter 7, Shapiro writes this important paragraph:\nIf you\u2019ve read the quoted paragraph more carefully, you\u2019ve already realized that, in the eyes of Shapiro, there\u2019s basically no difference between what happened in Germany (romantic nationalism), the Soviet Union (collective redistributionism) and Revolutionary France (scientific progressivism).\nTheir philosophies all made the same mistake: they put the collective before the individual.\nAnd after the fire, after everything was said and done, Jean-Paul Sartre (inspired by Soren Kierkegaard) tried to fill the gaping \u201cmeaning-shaped hole\u201d in an entirely new way: with the individual.\nWriting n \n, Sartre notes that humans are alone in a chaotic, meaningless world and, thus, are both condemned to be free and responsible for \n they do.\nGreek philosophy and Judaist religious thought believed that man, like a clock, has a clear predefined purpose. For Sartre, however, man is the very opposite of a clock: no definition of man precedes his/her existence.\nIn other words, we define ourselves through our actions.\nOf course, without a guidepost and communal responsibility, this didn\u2019t work either.\nAnd soon, the Neo-Enlightenment was born, which, once again, reverted to the European Enlightenment\u2019s views.\nWe\u2019ve tried scientific progressivism, Pinker, says Shapiro; it didn\u2019t work.\nChapter 9: The Return to Paganism\nCorrect us if we\u2019re wrong, but just like \n, Ben Shapiro thinks that many of the PC-related things that are happening today are the result of the reemergence of Marxism under the guise of postmodern beliefs and thoughts. \nHe doesn\u2019t really mention the phrase \u201cCultural Marxism,\u201d but he \n think that the \u201cJudeo-Christian-supported Enlightenment system\u201d was questioned, on false grounds, by the Frankfurt School of Thought, the members of which (Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse, Fromm, etc.) deliberately misread the nature of American individualism in an attempt to institute some social change.\nHe even goes further: after quoting Horkheimer\u2019s definition of \u201ccritical theory,\u201d Shapiro writes \u201cit is no coincidence that various forms of university study dedicated to various alleged victim groups\u2014black studies, Jewish studies, LGBT studies\u2014all find a home under the \u2018critical studies\u2019 rubric.\u201d\n(An important disclaimer for our readers: \n, which anyone who has \nread the books of these people would probably already know: for a start, the Frankfurt School of Thought critiqued both capitalism and Marxism.)\nAnyway, you know where this is going: Shapiro firmly believes that these thinkers have questioned the foundations of Western society, just like all those people analyzed in chapters 6 and 7.\nAfter intersectionality, victimhood has triumphed, and that spells the end of progress.\nThe vision of the Left for a better world, instead, provided polarization and solipsism and \u201ccarved off individuals into racial groups, then pitted them against one another.\u201d It is this that gave birth to the \u201cexecrable\u201d alt-right movements and the tribal mentality of the world today.\n\u201cOur only alternative,\u201d concludes Shapiro, \u201cwould be to return to the Judeo-Christian values and Greek reason that undergirded America\u2019s founding.\u201d\nConclusion: How to Build\nIn the conclusion of \n, Ben Shapiro suggests that it is through our children that we need to start returning to these values.\nSo, what do we teach our children? \n\u201cWhen I look at my four-year-old daughter and two-year-old son,\u201d Shapiro asks, \u201cwhat do I want them to know\u2014what \n they know to become defenders of the only civilization worth fighting for?\u201d\nNo more than four simple lessons:\n \n\u201cLife is not a bewildering, chaotic mess. It\u2019s a struggle, but it\u2019s a struggle \n \n.\u201d\n\u201cYou were given the ability to choose your path in life\u2014and you were born into the freest civilization in the history of mankind. Make the most of it. You are not a victim. In a free society, you are responsible for your actions.\u201d\n\u201cThe freedom you enjoy, and morals in which you believe, are products of a unique civilization\u2014the civilization of Dante and Shakespeare, the civilization of Bach and Beethoven, the civilization of the Bible and Aristotle.\u201d\n\u201cWe are not enemies if we share a common cause. And our common cause is a civilization replete with purpose, both communal and individual, a civilization that celebrates both individual and communal capacity.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Right Side of History\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judaic Revelation and Greek Reasoning Are the Building Blocks of Western Civilization\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jerusalem and Athens Go Hand in Hand: If One is Missing, Disaster Happens\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The New Left and the Neo-Enlightenment Threaten to Destroy the Western World\nJudaic Revelation and Greek Reasoning Are the Building Blocks of Western Civilization\nBefore the advent of Judaism, people were nothing more but playthings of the gods, i.e., slaves of fate. The Bible offered them a new world, one enriched with meaning: there is a master plan, it says, and the One who has devised it, will reward the ones who follow it\u2014even if this doesn\u2019t happen on Earth.\nMeanwhile, the Greeks devised an interesting idea of their own. They realized that this omniscient and omnipotent Being must have used some laws to create the world and that these laws can be deduced from careful observation of the world.\nWhen these two seemingly irreconcilable views of existence came together and meshed through the rise of Christianity\u2014the Western civilization was born.\nJerusalem and Athens Go Hand in Hand: If One is Missing, Disaster Happens\nIt is important to note that in every society which thrived, Greek Reason and Judaic Revelation went hand in hand; those which opted for one of the two failed miserably.\nFor example, the European Enlightenment abhorred religion and glorified reason\u2014but the French Revolution it gave birth to was a disaster. Nazis and Communists did pretty much the same, but their supposedly utopian societies collapsed in just a few decades.\nOn the other hand, the Americans embraced both Jerusalem and Athens\u2014and built the United States, the greatest and most powerful nation still.\nThe New Left and the Neo-Enlightenment Threaten to Destroy the Western World\nUnfortunately, quite a few New Left and Neo-Enlightenment thinkers believe that it is time that the Western World makes way for something new.\nBen Shapiro says that their \nis, in fact, pretty old and already seen in the cases of the French Revolution and the USSR.\nReligious narratives give meaning, and, without it, it\u2019s every man to himself; except, of course, those who are in power and who can wreak havoc upon everybody.\nHave we learned nothing from history?\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Right Side of History Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nWe\u2019ll use Jordan Peterson\u2019s endorsement to guide the future readers of \n.

Everything we have built\u2014everything we currently have in our great good fortune\u2014depends more than we can possibly imagine on each of us managing to do precisely that.\u201d\nWe hope the same thing."},

And Why?\nThe 14\n Dalai Lama\u2014aka Tenzin Gyatso\u2014has authored or co-authored almost a hundred books, but \nis one of the best-structured ones if you want to learn more about him and his worldview.\nNo wonder it was originally \n, which is French for \n. Though indisputably unconventional one, at times it does read like that\u2014and is certainly the closest thing you can find on the market to an autobiography of Dalai Lama.\nKudos to Sofia Stril-Rever\u2014a renowned Sanskrit expert and an interpreter for the Dalai Lama for more than a decade and a half\u2014who managed to compile the book, and provide it with sometimes much necessary footnotes and annotations.\nAbout Dalai Lama\n is the title Tibetans give to their foremost spiritual leaders. The current one is the last in a line of fourteen Dalai Lamas, and his religious name is Tenzin Gyatso.\nEnthroned as the Dalai Lama in 1940, and assuming political duties a decade later (at the tender age of 15), Tenzin Gyatso is consensually considered one of the spiritual leaders of the world.\nConsulted on various questions, the Dalai Lama has authored and co-authored many books, most of which are translated into several languages. Among them are \nand \n, the latter one co-authored with Desmond Tutu.\nFor his dedication to the cause of Tibet and his belief in nonviolence as the only path to a better future for humanity, the current Dalai Lama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 and was dubbed one of the \u201cChildren of Mahatma Gandhi\u201d by \nmagazine.\n\u201cMy Spiritual Journey PDF Summary\u201d\nWhen it first appeared in French, the original title of \n was \n. It was only for the English edition that the book got another title, one which tries to acknowledge the enormous contribution of Dalai Lama\u2019s translator and the compiler of this book, Sofia Stril-Rever.\nThe clarification, however\u2014as the editor of the English edition says\u2014\u201dshould in no way be perceived as anything but an authentication of these inspiring stories, lessons, and spiritual truths as the Dalai Lama\u2019s own, and an accurate and approved presentation of his spiritual journey through a most remarkable life.\u201d\nDalai Lama\u2019s Three Commitments in Life\nconsists of three parts, each of which chronicles the Dalai Lama\u2019s spiritual journey in one of three ways: as a human being, as a Buddhist monk, and as the Dalai Lama.\nThe book is framed the way it is because of the impact a speech of the Dalai Lama had Sofia Stril-Rever. The speech was originally delivered by the Dalai Lama to the European Parliament in Brussels, on December 4, 2008, and it is reprinted in the book as more than just a suitable afterword.\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll summarize it here first because it seems like the best way to start the summary. In the speech, the Dalai Lama lists the three commitments in his life.\nDalai Lama\u2019s first commitment, as a human being, is \u201cthe promotion of human values and those qualities of spirit that are key elements in a happy life, whether of an individual, a family, or a community.\u201d\u00a0\nAccording to him, these days, very few people seem to cultivate these values and qualities\u2014which is why he thinks it is his priority to advocate them.\nDalai Lama\u2019s second commitment, now as a Buddhist monk, is \u201cthe promotion of harmony among the different religions.\u201d At first, this may sound a bit strange, because, let\u2019s face it, the objective of most religions is to prove that theirs is the only valid one.\nThe Dalai Lama, fortunately, is one who understands the concept of \n and, moreover, one who has a real understanding of the difference between being religious and being spiritual (as we explained above).\nNobody would ever doubt the necessity of pluralism in political life\u2014that is the essence of democracy, isn\u2019t it?\u2014and yet, people are not that confident when it\u2019s a matter of diversity of beliefs and religions.\u00a0\nWell, the Dalai Lama can\u2019t see the logic behind this, especially in view of the fact that \u201call the chief religious traditions bring us the same message of love, compassion, tolerance, temperance, and self-discipline.\u201d\nAlmost expectedly, Dalai Lama\u2019s third commitment\u2014as the Dalai Lama\u2014is the cause of Tibet.\u00a0\nPeople often forget that, despite being one of the spiritual leaders of the world, he is also a political leader of a country. Moreover, a country which is basically occupied by one of the two superpowers, China.\nThe Dalai Lama is in exile ever since 1959\u2014he lives in India\u2014but he has never forgotten the well-being of his people.\nHe is aware that unlike his first two commitments (which depend solely on his will and discipline), the third one will only come to an end when a mutually satisfying solution is found between the Tibetans and the Chinese.\nIt\u2019s sad to say this, but it seems like the Dalai Lama has given up hope that this will happen in his lifetime.\nPart One: As a Human Being\nThe first part of \n encompasses two chapters: \u201cOur Common Humanity\u201d and \u201cMy Lives Without Beginning or End.\u201d In them, the Dalai Lama explains not only his childhood and upbringing in Lhasa but also his philosophy and worldview.\nThe basis of Dalai Lama\u2019s personal beliefs is quite simple:\nThis is something the Dalai Lama believes quite unwaveringly. As he sees it, his title \u201cDalai Lama\u201d is just a responsibility that has come down to him, and nothing else. At his basis, he is just a normal human being\u2014it just so happens that he is also a Buddhist and a Tibetan.\nThis view, of course, has far-reaching consequences.\nFor one, it blows in the face of \n. Unlike most ideologists of today, the Dalai Lama doesn\u2019t think that \u201cthe meaning of life\u201d is a question that can be answered on an individual basis.\nHe is quite confident in the opposite, in fact.\n\u201cOur life depends on others so much,\u201d he writes, \u201cthat at the root of our existence there is a fundamental need for love. That is why it is good to cultivate an authentic sense of our responsibility and a sincere concern for the welfare of others.\u201d\nIn other words, if all human beings long for love, how can we expect that glorifying individualism can prepare the way for a better, happier twenty-first century?\nIt is only through the acknowledgment that we are all alike and that each of us has a need for the other that we can really put back the capital H at the beginning of the word \u201chumanity.\u201d\nThis acknowledgment has a name.\nIt is compassion:\nThe Dalai Lama thinks of himself as \u201ca devoted servant of compassion\u201d: he says that nothing gives him more satisfaction that the practice of empathy and kindness.\u00a0\nWhen he left Tibet, he often says, he left all his wealth and material belongings behind him. But in his heart, he did manage to take with him something priceless: infinite compassion.\nAnother thing he didn\u2019t forget to take with him: contagious laughter. He says that he smiles all the time and that he has always tried to laugh away the worries and anxieties.\u00a0\nHow does he have the strength?\nWell, to quote him, he says that he is \u201ca professional laugher.\u201d And we don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s joking or not!\nPart Two: As a Buddhist Monk\nIn the second part of the book\u2014consisting of three chapters (\u201cTransforming Oneself,\u201d \u201cTransforming the World,\u201d and \u201cTaking Care of the World\u201d), the Dalai Lama explores his experiences as a Buddhist monk.\nHe introduces us to his ideal, that of the Bodhisattva, and talks about the necessity of pluralism when it comes to religion.\u00a0\nOne part that really struck a chord with us was the Dalai Lama\u2019s attempt to differentiate between religion and spirituality:\u00a0\nThis is why, the Dalai Lama calls for a spiritual and ethical revolution, one that will blur the lines between \n and \nand transform the world in our lifetimes.\nHe, once again, points the finger in the direction of the Western societies, which, though amazing in their energy, creativity, and hunger for knowledge, are disregarding interdependence as a fact of both nature and life.\n\u201cEven the smallest insects,\u201d the Dalai Lama says, \u201care social beings who, without the slightest religion, law, or education, survive thanks to mutual cooperation, based on an innate recognition of their interrelatedness.\u201d\nAnd if \u201cthe myriad forms of life, as well as the subtlest levels of material phenomena, are governed by interdependence,\u201d then why should humans be any different?\nBuddha discovered this millennia ago; and, for some reason, we still refuse to take note.\nPart Three: As the Dalai Lama\nThe last section of \nis, expectedly, the most political one.\nIt relays, in two chapters (\u201cIn 1959 the Dalai Lama Meets the World\u201d and \u201cI Appeal to All the Peoples of the World\u201d) his story as the political leader of a stateless nation.\nWe learn how the Dalai Lama became the temporal leader of Tibet at the age of 16, and how, from that moment on, he became the target of Chinese interest.\nJust one year before the Dalai Lama assumed full political duties, Mao Tse-tung had proclaimed the birth of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and very soon made known his intention to \u201cliberate\u201d Tibet.\nOn October 7, 1950, 40,000 men from the People\u2019s Liberation Army of China crossed the river Yangtze (the eastern border between Tibet and China) and entered the country of the Dalai Lama\n\u00a08,500 Tibetan soldiers could do nothing: the Chinese troops stopped just a little short of Tibet\u2019s capital, Lhasa, and asked the Tibetan government to send a delegation to Beijing to negotiate the condition of the \u201cpeaceful liberation.\u201d\nThe next year, a Seventeen Point Agreement was reached which affirmed Chinese sovereignty over Tibet. But on March 10, 1959, a revolt erupted in Lhasa, which was put down by the Chinese with the cost of much bloodshed.\nDalai Lama\u2019s life was in danger, but thousands of Tibetans spontaneously created a wall with their bodies around his summer residence and didn\u2019t disperse for a week. Eventually, most of them were killed by the Chinese Red Army.\nBut by then, masked as an ordinary soldier, the Dalai Lama had fled Tibet under the protection of the Freedom Fighters.\u00a0\nHe settled in India, from where he is still loud in his support for Tibet, appealing to the people of the world for help.\n\u201cI Place My Hope in the Human Heart\u201d\n\u201cIn spite of the atrocious crimes the Chinese have committed in our country,\u201d writes the Dalai Lama in the paragraphs chosen by Stril-Rever to serve as a sort of conclusion, \u201cI have absolutely no hatred in my heart for the Chinese people.\u201d\nWhy?\nBecause, as the Dalai Lama says a little below this sentence, he believes that one of the greatest dangers of the present age is \u201cto blame nations for the crimes of individuals.\u201d\nThat does a disservice to everyone!\nJust think about that!\nWhenever you say something along the lines \u201cThe French suck\u201d or \u201cAmericans are bad,\u201d you are insulting many admirable French and American citizens. The Dalai Lama says that: he knows many admirable Chinese as well, and it\u2019s wrong to blame the Chinese for his misfortunes and the misfortunes of his people.\nIt\u2019s not even a matter of \u201cgood people vs. bad people;\u201d it\u2019s merely a matter of people who have hope and are sources of it and people who don\u2019t have hope and diminish other people\u2019s hope.

Nothing is as powerful as it. Compassion is born the moment you realize that everyone on this planet\u2014including the people you hate\u2014want to be happy, and none of us ever wants to suffer.\nRemind yourself that as often as you can and the world will be a better place.\u00a0\nEliminate These Three Mental Poisons to Become a Better Person\nAccording to Buddhist philosophy, there are three mental poisons you should be aware of: ignorance, desire, and hatred.\nEvery time your mind is stung by either one of them, your body starts functioning in ways contrary to those that helped humans live in societies and made them by far the most developed species in the history of the universe.\nYou need to be mindful of these three poisons: just identifying them is enough to prevent them from taking hold of your mind and body.\nSo, every time you realize that you don\u2019t know or desire something, or that you hate someone, stop for a second, put that down on paper, and think it through.\nWould you like to live in a world ruled by ignorance and hate, a world where instead of wanting to \n more, people want to \n more?\nWe neither.\nDalai Lama\u2019s Three Commitments in Life\nAs a human being, the Dalai Lama is committed to the idea of promoting human values.\nAs a Buddhist monk, he is interested in promoting harmony between different religions.\nFinally, as the 14\n Dalai Lama, he wants to see Tibet free.\nThese are the Dalai Lama\u2019s three commitments in life\u2014and he intends to maintain them until his final breath.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cMy Spiritual Journey Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nJust like most of the Dalai Lama\u2019s books, \n is a collection of his speeches and words given at many different occasions and to many different people.

This is exactly what I\u2019d hoped adulthood would be.\u201d\nWhat does that mean, you ask?\nWell, it\u2019s simple: \nBut that didn\u2019t happen, did it?\n\u201cI suppose I could blame my state of mind on the election of Donald Trump,\u201d writes Chelsea Handler in the first chapter of \n, titled \u201cWhere Have I Been All My Life.\u201d\nYou\u2019d expect a \u201cbut\u201d after the sentence quoted above, but Chelsea follows it with something entirely different.\n\u201cSo I will,\u201d she says.\nAnd she goes on:\nSo, in other words, Chelsea was wondering what most of us were wondering about two years ago: how, on earth, did Donald Trump become a President and how did most of the world didn\u2019t even know this outcome was even a possibility?\nAnd that, right there, inspired Chelsea to do something she hadn\u2019t done before: start a spiritual journey. Only she calls it \u201cThe Year of Self-Sufficiency\u201d because she not only hates but despises the word \u201cjourney\u201d \u2013 ever since \nruined it a decade ago (\u201ca manufactured relationship on a reality show is not a \u2018journey\u2019\u201d).\nBut you know what she means.\nNow, the first thing that came to Chelsea\u2019s mind in the \u201ctorpor of despair\u201d she had fallen in after Hillary didn\u2019t become a President was a single word: \u201celitist.\u201d\nAfter all, it was the word everybody was using in all of the President-Trump-related explanations at the time. Apparently, \u201ceveryone in California and New York lived in a bubble\u201d and \u201cthe election of this lunatic was a result of all of us not knowing anything about the rest of the country.\u201d\nThat didn\u2019t ring true for Chelsea.\nAfter all, she had traveled all over the country doing stand-up for so many years and had visited almost every major and minor city multiple times.\nMoreover, her father had been a used-car dealer, she didn\u2019t have a trust fund, and never even went to college due to lack of money; not to mention: she worked as a waitress numerous times, and was \u201cbroke for seven years living paycheck to paycheck.\u201d\nSo, what kind of privilege are we talking about here?\nWell, precisely the kind you would expect a New Yorker or a Floridan to have: \u201cI had created a life in which there was a zero-tolerance policy for any discomfort,\u201d Chelsea writes.\n\u201cI did live in a bubble, inside a bigger bubble, which was inside an even bigger bubble. Three bubbles. Two assistants, two cleaning ladies (who are more like my nannies), a driver, a pool guy, a landscaper, a florist, a houseman.\u201d\n \u201cI had become exactly what I\u2019d always wanted to be\u2014an elitist,\u201d Chelsea concludes.\nAnd, of course, this revelation scares her immensely; after all, it means that she\u2019s one of those people who have probably contributed to Trump being elected a President.\nCue: midlife crisis.\nWhat gets her out of it?\nWell, the first thing was a line she remembered from Viktor Frankl\u2019s memoir, \n:\n\u201cit did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.\u201d\nWhy does Chelsea even know that line by heart?\nSimply put, because she got tired, at an early age, of reading hard books (such as \n) and she wanted to hack the tests her father gave her to be sure she had read the books he had tasked her with reading.\nNamely, Chelsea\u2019s father believed that there was one line in every book which summed up the whole book. So, when Chelsea got to such a line (she refers to them as putter-downers), she\u2019d stop reading the books and relate the line to her father, giving the impression that she had read the whole book.\nBut, now, one of these lines (the one quoted above) really spelled volumes in her mind: \n she started asking herself, wondering \nAnd, suddenly, it all seemed clear: Chelsea was always \u201cwhite, pretty, and Jewish,\u201d always loved by many and never hungry, self-confident, \u201ca lot of luck and a lot of privilege;\u201d in other words, life was \n actually difficult for her.\n\u201cMy life \na bubble,\u201d she realized. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what it had become. A big vapid bubble.\u201d\nSo, she decided to burst that bubble and start discovering herself.\nThe Journey\nFor Chelsea, the process of self-discovery (once again, sorry, Chelsea, for calling it a \u201cjourney\u201d) includes learning quite a few pretty basic things (such as working the remote, picking up the dog\u2019s feces, or finding the toaster), trying out a few new drugs and going back to the old ones (marijuana, ayahuasca), and becoming politically active. \nLet\u2019s share with you some highlights.\nIn an episode of her \n show, \n \u2013 titled \u201cDinner Party: Getting School\u201d \u2013 Handler interviews a neuropsychiatrist and researcher named Daniel J. Siegel. But you know him already, don\u2019t you: he\u2019s the guy who authored \n and \n.\nWell, just a few months after the election, this same guy becomes Chelsea\u2019s first real psychiatrist.\nHer first few sessions consist of Dan guiding her through meditation; of course, the rest of the time Chelsea talks of nothing else but Donald Trump.\n\u201cI was paying someone hundreds of dollars an hour to complain about Donald Trump, which seemed like the exact right move,\u201d she writes. \u201cI would have paid him double. I had definitely paid for far worse in my life. I knew people were getting sick and tired of my anger directed toward the 2016 election and the daily horrifying cabinet appointees, and Ivanka and that schmuck Jared, and that evil witch they called a press secretary.\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t wrap my head around the fact that Sarah Suckabee Sanders and Ivanka Trump had no morality or sense of obligation to the very sex they inhabited \u2013 to stand up and say, No more. I needed someone to let me vent, privately. I needed someone to help me harness my anger into something positive.\u201d\nDan, however, was merely preparing the field for something far deeper than these kinds of superficial frustrations; and if you\u2019ve ever been to a psychiatrist, you know full well what we\u2019re talking about: childhood issues.\nThe first time Dan asked Chelsea about her childhood, Handler answered in a very disinterested manner: \u201cmy parents were kind of lame, I have five brothers and sisters, one of whom died when he was twenty-two, and my mom died a few years ago\u2026 but I\u2019d rather talk about right now. \n?\u201d\n\u201c\n,\u201d she adds offstage, \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t about to admit that to a stranger.\u201d\nIn time, however, she opens up and realizes something strange: Trump\u2019s election got to her because she saw it as some sort of a recurrence of what had happened to her when she was nine, and her 22-year-old brother Chet died on a hiking trip.\nHow, you ask?\nWell, in both cases, the world just turned upside-down for Chelsea.\nHer brother Chet (the oldest of a family where Chelsea was the youngest \u2013 they were the bookends) represented practically everything for Chelsea.\nShe wasn\u2019t that fascinated with her parents and, in time, Chet started representing much more than a brother: a father, a crush, a boyfriend. Hell, Chet was the first man she ever slept with \u2013 but not in a gross way, of course (it was when Chet was 13 and Chelsea had just been born!)\nAnd he had told her, before going on the trip to get some rest, that he would never allow for her to grow up around people such as Chelsea\u2019s parents.\nThen, he never returned.\nChelsea doesn\u2019t believe men to this day because of this: the first man she got emotionally attached to, lied to her about the most important thing ever; and didn\u2019t keep his promise.\nIn a great chapter of Chelsea Handler\u2019s memoir, she retells the filming of one of the episodes of her new \n show in which she and two of her friends (Jenny Mollen and Dan Maurio) try ayahuasca in front of the cameras.\nNow, before you take ayahuasca, it\u2019s recommended that you cleanse. Chelsea, unlike her two friends, didn\u2019t, and spent the night holding and comforting Jenny, while Dan was moaning on a mat in the corner of the room. \nIn other words, while the two intermittently vomited and broke down, she was becoming more and more sober. Add to this a lot of crying and diarrhea, and, as Chelsea says, \u201cthe situation couldn\u2019t have gotten any worse\u2014the final blow being that it was all caught on film and would be airing on Netflix.\u201d (Well, it already is: just watch the fourth episode of \n.)\nAnyway, the next time Chelsea was advised to try ayahuasca on her own, and this time everything\u2019s great: she is, unexpectedly, overcome with love for her sister.\nHer conclusion?\n\u201cYou have been a human doing, and we need to get you to be a human being,\u201d says Daniel J. Siegel to Chelsea during one of their therapy sessions.\n\u201cIt just sounds like something straight out of a therapist\u2019s handbook,\u201d Chelsea objected.\nHowever, during the year of her self-sufficiency, during her post-Trump journey of self-discovery, Handler realized that Siegel was more than right: and that\u2019s precisely what happened during her transformation chronicled in \n.\nShe sums up the experience in four great sentences:\n\u201cI thought I was nailing it, for a really long time. I spent my twenties wanting people to think I was great. I spent my thirties thinking people thought I was great. I turned forty, and I started wondering what I thought about me.\u201d\nHandler ends the book with a few pieces of advice which sound a lot as if taken straight out of the \u201cWear Sunscreen\u201d hypothetical speech.\nWe\u2019ll quote them in our key lessons.\nKey Lessons from \u201cLife Will Be the Death \u043ef Me\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If You Are a New Yorker or a Floridan \u2013 You Are Probably an Elitist\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Your Frustration with Trump May Be Related to Your Family\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chelsea Handler Has Something to Tell You\nIf You Are a New Yorker or a Floridan \u2013 You Are Probably an Elitist\nChelsea Handler didn\u2019t exactly live a privileged life for some parts of it \u2013 her father had been a used-car dealer, and she spent at least seven years making ends meet \u2013 which is why she failed to see that one of the reasons that Trump happened was her.\nNamely, as she realized soon after Trump got elected, in her LA apartment, she did have a butler and two servants, and if that\u2019s not elitist \u2013 what is?\nWell, people in NY and LA scoffed at the very idea of Trump becoming a President because they were segregated in the privileged districts of America.\nYour Frustration with Trump May Be Related to Your Family\nChelsea Handler was very mad after Trump won. So mad, in fact, that she started seeing a psychotherapist. Most of the sessions were nothing more than her ranting on and on about Trump being \u201ca bag of psychological cement.\u201d\nHowever, he was also a catalyst for her unlocking her own bag of psychological cement: his election meant that the world had unhinged, and that\u2019s exactly what happened to Chelsea when her brother Chet unexpectedly died on a hiking trip when she was 9.\nShe was reliving the greatest tragedy of her life; fortunately, this time, she finally realized who she was \u2013 and had been all along.\nChelsea Handler Has Something to Tell You\nAs we promised above, \nends with a string of advices coming directly from Chelsea. \nHere, we quote them in full:\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cLife Will Be the Death \u043ef Me Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\n is so honest that it even recreates her heartfelt discussions with her therapist (Dan Siegel) related to her childhood traumas and the death of her oldest brother.\n\u201cThis will be one of your favorite books of all time,\u201d says Amy Schumer. \u201cThrough her intensely vulnerable, honest, and hilarious reflections, Chelsea shows us more than just her insides. She shows us ourselves.\u201d\nThe opinion is shared by everybody from Gloria Steinem to Ellen DeGeneres, from Trevor Noah to Jon Favreau.\nAfter all, as David Foster Wallace suggested, we do need more honesty in this world; and Handler\u2019s honesty is take-no-prisoners fearless!"},

Being able to click with someone is a process that is so deeply entrenched in our mindset, that is almost impossible to break.\nDon, delivers an ancient but practical guide related to the art of building fruitful relationships and explains the benefits springing from them.\nLet\u2019s dive right in.\nWho Should Read \u201cThe Mastery of Love\u201d? And Why?\nThe secrets of Toltec wisdom are embedded deep into the hearts of naguals who have inhabited the region of today\u2019s central and North America for hundreds and perhaps thousands of years.\nWhile dealing with the challenges of survival, they\u2019ve developed a set of ideas that had guided them through difficult times.\nWith this in mind, we firmly believe that \u201c\n\u201d is a good fit for the broader audience.\nAbout Don Miguel Ruiz\n was born on August 27, 1952, and is best known for his eagerness to unpack the Toltec spiritualist philosophy.\nHe is also a bestselling author, who has written a couple of profound neo-shamanistic texts that revolve around ancient teachings. \n\u201cThe Mastery of Love PDF Summary\u201d\nBefore the Europeans landed on the shores of what in the middle-ages was known as the New World, the Toltec had already earned the reputation of being \n and \n of knowledge. In recent studies and white papers, scientists have spoken of the Toltec, as a race.\nIn fact, they were scientists who contrived a society that was propelled by spirituality and knowledge. \nOver the course of hundreds of years, the \n were compelled to keep this knowledge a secret from those who planned to misuse it for personal gain. During the European conquest, in particular, the \n remained in the shadows, fearful of potential abuse of power.\nLuckily, the fortune was kept alive and passed on from generation to generation despite being under constant pressure of new cultural tenets. Don Miguel Ruiz, himself a \n from the Eagle Knight lineage, decided to lift the veil on the powerful practices and teachings of the Toltec.\nThe Wounded Mind\nIt is needless to say that we are all masters of our own little world. \nIn the same way, societies have created their own heroes, villains, and people to be venerated, our own minds have the power to do the exact same thing. Among other things, we also attribute specific features to one group of people whose actions reflect their inner world.\nEvidently, we\u2019ve been doing this since the beginning of time, and it is nothing other than an attempt to master your own personality and define your principles.\nIt takes years for a person to reach a certain level of mastery. Also, this is in direct relation with the idea you have of yourself, so striving to form your own set of beliefs is at the core of the Toltec wisdom. \nIt also helps you understand that all of us are masters, whether we are aware of it or not \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter.\nThink of it this way \u2013 children get into a quarrel with their friends about something trivial, and they get angry. With time, that child becomes aware that neglecting the problem, or pushing it aside, doesn\u2019t add to the problem-solving, not in the least.\nSo, as a response, the child instinctively strives to become the master of anger. You can apply the same process to almost any external phenomena such as:\nWhen the fear of rejection or rebuff develops into something overwhelming, our mind is pushed into a state of confinement. It can no longer treat the wounds inflicted upon itself, and it is something that the medicine labels as mental illness. \nIf you are into reading, you\u2019ll come across some more specific terms such as schizophrenia, paranoia, Alzheimer\u2019s psychosis, and others. Also, these diseases are a direct consequence of our mind\u2019s impaired ability to heal the wounds, from the moment they surface. \nThe mind is frightened to take action and decides to abandon the outside world while being driven by the notion of less suffering. \nThe fear of getting hurt, can only be described as a fuel on the fire, or to use a more sophisticated term, it leads to the creation of a: \n. \nThis system is the perfect breeding ground for lies, and it facilitates the process of becoming a liar. The goal is that eventually one day, that lie is going to become your deep-rooted reality, and no one would dare to question it.\n\u2013 Don Miguel Ruiz writes.\nAs we pointed out, each of us creates or nurtures a set of personal beliefs that represent the foundation for the development of personal identity. But, we are also dragged into this big outside dream that creates the rules and sets the damn game. \nThe big dream incorporates in itself the cultural values, the religious tenets, the laws, regulations, and the environmental rules. \nThe question that troubles the mind of many is \u2013 Is this the right way to organize society?\nWhen a human is born, his or her existence is intact and clear of emotional baggage. In other words, the human is healthy pretty much until it hits the age of four. Then, the first wounds begin to crop up, and as time goes by, the emotional wounds only become more painful and poisonous. \nAlmost all of humanity will agree that the happiest moments in our lives are when we embrace the child-like behavior. \nThe fear of being judged disappears, the idea of being rewarded also vanishes, and we are simply there to enjoy life and have fun.\nThe adults, already infected with the disease of denial, pass it on to their children like some badge of honor. And as we said, the emotional wounds only become more contagious as the child grows both physically and mentally.\nSome might argue that the problem lies in the upbringing of children, but the real problem prevails in the programming of our minds.\nWith time, young toddlers lose their innocence and acceptance of themselves and replace it with a wide array of fears. The most symbolic one is the fear of rejection; brought to life by our ignorance and social brainwashing, to say the least. \nYou can absolutely see how love and freedom are shattered in the presence of children, just by looking at them.\nAs grown-ups, we can all relate to the times when we were punished or reprimanded just for being too playful as kids. As if, it is bad to express your innate proclivity towards playing and expressing joy. It is impossible not to notice that the risk-reward system is corrupt to the very core.\n\u201cYou are grounded\u201d or being said something along the lines of that\u2019s not how good boys/girls behave; is not very productive.\nAnd no, we are not talking about gender roles, but the sense that something is right and something is wrong. \nWhen that poison becomes ingrained into our daily lives, the sense of injustice only grows bigger.\nYou are no longer a child, and you have to deal with the world. For instance, if you are in a relationship with an abusive partner, you\u2019ll probably prolong your suffering by espousing the idea of you being the culprit for your partner\u2019s misconduct.\nAs you become tolerant of abusive behavior, the world will inflict havoc upon you. \nYou live in a dream, some might call it an illusion, but it\u2019s more of a vision you have of yourself. That dream, or whatever name you want to affix to it, is only genuine to you, and only you. \nNot even your mother nor your closest circle embraces the same vision.\nYou have to acknowledge the fact that every dream is a form of life in and out of itself. Some might call it an apt description for one\u2019s mindset, but it is more of a mix of emotions, experience, and hopes.\nApparently, it\u2019s not easy to let go of the judgemental notions altogether, because it is more of a process than a one-time thing. \nTo achieve mental victory, a person must tackle its inclinations towards exhibiting reactions and settle down.\nYou\u2019ll often see and hear people who chastise themselves for minor mistakes and say things along the lines of:\nEven though life just keeps on giving, the drama doesn\u2019t seem to stop. \nSome call it a numbers game; with time, more positive emotions will overpower the fewer negative ones, but it\u2019s not as easy as it appears. \nYou cannot order your mind to think positively, and love when you have built-up this negative mindset, which acts in a very destructive manner.\nIn the process, you are not just hurting yourself, as these notions preclude you from forming strong bonds with other people. Nurturing positive relationships becomes more distant to you, as you delve into lies and denial.\nThe Creator of the Universe tells us to accept ourselves and not fall prey to the social norms of today.\nLoving yourself in this world of madness is becoming harder and harder, despite all the inventions that made life easier for us.\nRemember, there are is no right and wrong; there are no winners and losers; they are all in your head.\nHow to move away from this stalemate?\nStart the next day with a prayer for self-love.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Mastery of Love\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Get ahold of yourself\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Build the perfect relationship\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The biggest demon\nGet ahold of yourself\nIt might come as a shock to someone, but you are not here to justify your existence.\nExpectations put up, on your behalf, should be discarded immediately as the level of success must never be gauged by your willingness to please society.\nBuild the perfect relationship\nThis lesson is not only in reference to other human beings, but it also conveys the meaning of being in peace with yourself.\nPlunging into a productive discussion is the backbone of any relationship, and that\u2019s precisely what you should be eager to apply.\nThe biggest demon\nFrom today\u2019s vantage point, we can all see that angels, demons, and saints are nothing other than a human creation.\n \u2013 being the biggest sin, was seen as the fast-route to hell.\nBut, we are all sexual creatures \u2013 built or made to create life on Earth, and there\u2019s nothing wrong about engaging in sexual intercourse.

And Why?\nYou think you know what time is? Chances are: you don\u2019t. For a simple reason: nobody really does. Even physicists.\u00a0\nThis one, however\u2014the exceptional Carlo Rovelli\u2014is so great in communicating this lack of knowledge that you\u2019ll feel so much richer by the end of this fairly short, but infinitely rich and poetic book.\nRead \n if you\u2019re curious about how time works, and, moreover, about how scientists think.\u00a0\nAbout Carlo Rovelli\n is an Italian theoretical physicist, founder of loop quantum gravity theory, and one of \n\u2019s 100 most influential global thinkers.\nA regular collaborator with several Italian newspapers, Rovelli is one of the great popularizers of science, dubbed \u201cthe new Stephen Hawking\u201d by \n, and \u201cthe poet of quantum physics\u201d by Ireland\u2019s greatest modern novelist, John Banville.\nRovelli\u2019s beautiful \nhas been translated into no less than 40 languages and has sold over a million copies worldwide; this one, \n, was chosen as one of \nTen Best Nonfiction Books of 2018.\nFind out more at \n.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Order of Time PDF Summary\u201d\n\u201cReality is often very different from what it seems,\u201d writes Carlo Rovelli in the \u201cIntroduction\u201d to \n, aptly dubbed \u201cPerhaps Time Is the Greatest Mystery.\u201d\n\u201cThe Earth,\u201d he goes on, \u201cappears to be flat but is in fact spherical. The sun seems to revolve in the sky when it is really \n who are spinning.\u201d\nAnalogously, even though time appears to be a uniform, universal flowing, it is anything but: we don\u2019t inhabit it as fish swimming in the water (the water being the time in this metaphor), and it doesn\u2019t drag the universe into the future from the past.\n\u201cTime works quite differently from the way it seems to,\u201d says Rovelli, and he wastes no time to completely and utterly blow our minds what lies behind that sentence.\nLet\u2019s go over the highlights.\nPart I THE CRUMBLING OF TIME\nIn the first\u2014and perhaps most interesting\u2014part (especially for novices) of \n, Carlo Rovelli summarizes what modern physics knows about time.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is like holding a snowflake in your hands,\u201d he poetically notes, \u201cgradually, as you study it, it melts between your fingers and vanishes\u201d:\u00a0\nHence the title of this part: as we discovered more and more about time, it slowly disintegrated to mean something pretty much counter-intuitive: a complex collection of structures and layers which is neither unified nor independent, and which has neither a direction nor definite value.\nLet\u2019s start with perhaps the most fundamental aspect of time: it, we believe, passes everywhere at the very same speed.\nThis is, however, completely wrong: even if you place a clock on the table and compare it, after a few years, with one sitting at the floor, the two will differ. True, the differences would be minuscule, but it is measurable and exists: the clock on the table would always tick faster.\u00a0\nThis, of course, suggests something even bigger.\nNamely, what if you are a twin who separates from his brother/sister to live on the mountain, leaving your sibling on the seashore?\nBelieve it or not, time would move faster for you, and you\u2019ll live longer than your sibling in absolute terms. It is a scientific fact: \u201ctime passes faster in the mountains than it does at sea level.\u201d\nAnd it is also one of the things Einstein discovered a century ago: gravity is just a side-effect of large bodies modifying the structure of space-time between them.\nBecause of this modification, Earth slows down the flow of time, but it does so at different rates: the plains are closer to it, so there time slows more than it does so in the mountains.\n\u201cIf things fall, it is due to this slowing down of time,\u201d writes Rovelli. \u201cWhere time passes uniformly, in interplanetary space, things do not fall. They float, without falling. Here on the surface of our planet, on the other hand, the movement of things inclines naturally toward where time passes more slowly, as when we run down the beach into the sea, and the resistance of the water on our legs makes us fall headfirst into the waves. Things fall downward because, down there, time is slowed by the Earth.\u201d\nFascinating?\nWait till you hear the rest!\nAnother fundamental time-related thing we experience as pretty much a given is its parts: past, present, future.\u00a0\n\u201cPast and future are different from each other,\u201d explains Rovelli. \u201cCause precedes effect. Pain comes after a wound, not before it. The glass shatters into a thousand pieces, and the pieces do not re-form into a glass. We cannot change the past; we can have regrets, remorse, memories. The future instead is uncertainty, desire, anxiety, open space, destiny, perhaps. We can live toward it, shape it, because it does not yet exist. Everything is still possible\u2026 Time is not a line with two equal directions: it is an arrow with different extremities.\u201d\nStrangely enough, this \nisn\u2019t true: \u201cThe difference between past and future, between cause and effect, between memory and hope, between regret and intention\u2026 in the elementary laws that describe the mechanisms of the world, there is no such difference.\u201d\nBelieve it or not, the \n law which distinguishes the past from the future is the Second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of a system can never decrease over time.\nIn plainer words, if nothing else changes, heat cannot pass from a cold body to a hot one.\nIn essence, this means that time is fundamentally interrelated with heat: \u201cevery time a difference is manifested between the past and the future, heat is involved. In every sequence of events that becomes absurd if projected backward, there is something that is heating up.\u201d\nEven when you\u2019re thinking: thinking produces heat in your head, and that is the only reason why your thoughts move from the past to the future.\nNow that we\u2019re done with the past and the future, let\u2019s strip time of yet another of its intuitively graspable levels: the present.\nBelieve it or not, the word \u201cnow\u201d means nothing beyond your approximate surroundings: in universal terms, now is a non-existent concept.\nThink of it this way: when you\u2019re watching the sunset, the Sun is already set\u2014because it takes its light approximately 8 minutes and 19 seconds to reach our planet, that\u2019s precisely how far back into the past of the sun you\u2019re seeing at your apparent \u201cnow.\u201d\nPut more plainly, the \u201cnow\u201d of the Sun and your \u201cnow\u201d are two different moments of time: it\u2019s almost as if you and it are existing in two parallel worlds.\nWhat if that actually happens?\nWhat if your sister decides to leave this planet and start a life on the planet Proxima B, located about four light years away from the Earth?\nWhat would you see through the telescope at any given moment?\nWell, your sister from 4 years ago!\nAnd this is where it gets even stranger: if, during this time she manages to discover some spaceship flying at a speed faster than the speed of light, you might be, in theory, able to both see her on Proxima B, and right around the corner of your street!\n\u201cIt simply makes no sense to ask which moment in the life of your sister on Proxima B corresponds to now,\u201d writes Rovelli. \u201cIt is like asking which football team has won a basketball championship, how much money a swallow has earned, or how much a musical note weighs.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no special moment on Proxima b that corresponds to what constitutes the present here and now,\u201d he concludes.\nCue: Twilight Zone theme music.\nThe reason why time works so counter-intuitively is rather simple: it is \n independent; it is directly related to something we are able to understand a bit better, i.e., space.\nTime and space\u2014after Einstein referred to, almost always and correctly, as \u201cthe time-space continuum\u201d\u2014are two sides of the same coin and they, quite materially, form \n.\nWhen an object of massive size (such as the Earth) warps the time-space continuum, the result is gravity and a specific \u201cflow of time\u201d at that specific place, depending, of course, on the size of the denture. Black holes, for example, bend the time-space continuum so much that, \n, time stops completely.\nWe managed to understand more about this via something Einstein didn\u2019t believe in that much: quantum physics.\nIt led us to three fundamental discoveries: granularity, indeterminacy, and the relational aspect of physical variables.\nis the most characteristic feature of quantum mechanics. It means that a minimum scale exists for all phenomena, including time. The smallest unit of time is called Planck time and it amounts to 10\n seconds: a hundred millionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second. At such a minute scale, the notion of time is no longer valid.\nmeans\nthat \u201cit is not possible to predict exactly, for instance, where an electron will appear tomorrow. Between one appearance and another, the electron has no precise position, as if it were dispersed in a cloud of probability.\nIn addition, an electron is concrete \nthe other physical objects it is interacting with. In other words, \n happens only in relation to a physical system.\n\u201cTime has loosened into a network of relations that no longer holds together as a coherent canvas,\u201d concludes Rovelli.\u00a0\nThe actual picture on the canvas is this: \u201cspacetimes (in the plural) fluctuating, superimposed one above the other, materializing at certain times with respect to particular objects.\u201d\nPart II THE WORLD WITHOUT TIME\nIn the second part of \n, Rovelli describes what we are left with once we\u2019ve stripped time off all of its layers: \u201can empty, windswept landscape almost devoid of all trace of temporality.\u201d And yet, this is precisely our world.\nSo, let\u2019s see how that world actually looks like.\nOne of the strangest consequences of this line of thinking is this: nothing ever \n, everything, ultimately and merely, just \n.\u00a0\nBecause if time doesn\u2019t exist the way we believe it does, \ndon\u2019t exist either: every single thing you see around you is merely just a more durable event.\nAt first sight, there\u2019s a big difference between a stone and a kiss: the first is the prototypal thing, the letter an embodiment of an event.\u00a0\nWe will never ask ourselves \nthe kiss will be tomorrow, but we can ask ourselves \n the stone will be in twelve days. On the other hand, it is a pretty sound question to ask someone \ndid he/she have his/her first kiss.\nHowever, as we found out above, time and space work together, And on closer inspection, we realize that even the most \u201cthinglike\u201d things such as stones are nothing but long events.\n\u201cThe hardest stone,\u201d writes Rovelli, \u201cin the light of what we have learned from chemistry, from physics, from mineralogy, from geology, from psychology, is in reality a complex vibration of quantum fields, a momentary interaction of forces, a process that for a brief moment manages to keep its shape, to hold itself in equilibrium before disintegrating again into dust.\u201d\n\u201cThinking of the world as a collection of events, of processes,\u201d he goes on, \u201cis the way that allows us to better grasp, comprehend, and describe it. It is the only way that is compatible with relativity. The world is not a collection of things, it is a collection of events.\u201d\nUnfortunately, our grammar is inadequate to grasp this.\u00a0\nIt is strange to think, but that quote which introduces the popular Netflix German TV show called \nby Einstein isn\u2019t a metaphor, but a physical fact:\n\u201cPeople like us who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.\u201d\nThis sentence is taken from a letter by Einstein to the son and sister of Michele Besso sent near the end of his life. And it\u2019s one which makes the distinction between \n and \nIn \n, we know precisely what \u201cnow\u201d means because we believe in an objective global present. Yet, as physics discovered, the present is relative to the observer, i.e., what is real for one is not actually real for someone else.\nThat\u2019s where \n comes: the idea that flow and change are illusory and that the past, present, and the future are all equally real and existent.\nThis is closer to the truth than you can imagine, but it is also not the truth.\u00a0\nThe truth is that there is \norder of time, i.e., the temporal structure of the world is not that of \n. But the changes mentioned in Einstein\u2019s quote are not illusory, but real. The thing is they do not follow a global order.\nEinstein\u2019s letter was sent to console a grieving sister, and it is only because of the inadequacy of grammar and our metaphor-laden language that we confuse things.\nIt is also because of this that we are unable to understand\u2014or even speak about\u2014certain natural phenomena.\nPart III THE SOURCES OF TIME\n\u201cThe third part of the book,\u201d writes Rovelli, \u201cis the most difficult, but also the most vital and the one that most closely involves us. In a world without time, there must still be something that gives rise to the time that we are accustomed to, with its order, with its past that is different from the future, with its smooth flowing. Somehow, our time must emerge around us, at least for us and at our scale.\u201d\nSo let\u2019s see how and why we \ntime in a timeless universe.\nImagine a group of children deciding between themselves the two opposing sides in a football game by, say, tossing a coin.\nOf course, after some time there are two teams on the field pitted against each other.\nThe thought-provoking question?\nWhere were the teams \nthe coin toss?\nNowhere. Simply put, they didn\u2019t exist: they are the result of the coin toss. They are an \u201cemergent phenomenon.\u201d\nWell, you should think of time as something like that: it is not an objective fact, it is not something that exists out there. It is something that \ndue to our particular perspective of the universe, granted by a set of circumstances and our subjective vision.\n\u201cThe entire difference between past and future,\u201d writes Carlo Rovelli, \u201cmay be attributed solely to the fact that the entropy of the world was low in the past.\u201d\nAs we saw above, in time, entropy always increases; if it was the other way around, we would have lived in a world not that unlike a rewound movie: pieces of shattered glass would form a bottle and the smoke\u2014cigarettes.\nSo, in other words, if there\u2019s no entropy\u2014i.e., if nothing changes\u2014there is no time as well. And, in a way, it is entropy, not energy, that drives the world.\nThink of it this way: if entropy always increases, then only where it is tightly packed in orderly pieces of matter, there could be such things as history and evolution.\nFortunately, we live inside a universe where this is the case: we don\u2019t know precisely why (Rovelli has a theory), but, for some reason, we are that place of the universe where the second law of thermodynamics works to our benefit.\nHow and why?\nWell, it all starts with the sun, a rich source of low entropy which is usable because it is located very close to our planet.\nThe sun radiates a hot photon (light particles) toward Earth, and the Earth harks back by emitting ten colder photons which have less energy and, thus, balance things out.\nA hot photon, however, has much less entropy than ten colder photons (as we said above, heat always moves to cold, not the other way around).\nThis way, the Earth can use the Sun\u2019s energy to power its processes and make things move around. This, of course, results in low entropy transforming in high entropy, such as the ones occurring in your body which, ultimately, will lead to a state of lowest entropy called death.\n\u201cThe existence of common causes in the past is nothing but a manifestation of low entropy in the past,\u201d writes Rovelli. \u201cIn a state of thermal equilibrium, or in a purely mechanical system, there isn\u2019t a direction to time identified by causality.\u201d\n\u201cWe are processes, events, composite and limited in space and time,\u201d concludes Rovelli.\u00a0\n\u201cBut if we are not an individual entity,\u201d he goes on, \u201cwhat is it that founds our identity and its unity? What makes it so\u2014that I am Carlo\u2014and that my hair and my nails and my feet are considered part of me, as well as my anger and my dreams, and that I consider myself to be the same Carlo as yesterday, the same as tomorrow; the one who thinks, suffers, and perceives?\u201d\nMany different ingredients, he says, but three are of the utmost importance: point of view, organization by grouping and segmenting, and memory.\nis self-explanatory: \u201cThe world is reflected in each one of us through a rich spectrum of correlations essential for our survival. Each of us is a complex process that reflects the world and elaborates the information we receive in a way that is \n integrated.\u201d\nThe second ingredient (organization) suggests this: we tend to group and segment things into entities so that we can better grasp them. That\u2019s why we call a certain collection of rocks and fields \u201cMount Everest\u201d and a certain collection of atoms that change \u201cJack\u201d or \u201cJill.\u201d\nFinally, the third ingredient which comprises our identity is \n, perhaps the most essential one as far as time is concerned. Because it is memory which catalogizes things in our brains in a narrative manner, making strict distinctions between past and future events.\nThat is why people who have memory problems can\u2019t organize the world in such a neat manner and confuse between the past and the present. That is why they no longer seem as unified beings\u2014but as someone different from them.\nMemory is a guarantee of identity.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Order of Time\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Faster You Are, the Slower Time Moves \n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Past and the Future Exist Because of Heat\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Our Universe Is a Special Case\u2014And That\u2019s Why Time Looks the Way It Does\nThe Faster You Are, the Slower Time Moves\u00a0\nIt may seem like some sort of a glitch taken straight out of SF-novels, but, as Carlo Rovelli says, \u201cthis is how reality works.\u201d\nIn other words, whether you like it or not, we know for a fact (\n) that the faster you move, the slower time moves for you, resulting in a singular paradox.\nNamely, a twin who travels at speed near the speed of light and goes to another planet, after returning, would be much younger than his brother.\nDon\u2019t believe us?\nIn 1971, two Americans (a physicist and an astronomer) \n, sending four cesium atomic clocks in different directions around the planet to see if they\u2019ll gain nanoseconds when compared to the clocks at the US Naval Observatory.\nThey did\u2014\n as much as Einstein predicted.\nThe Past and the Future Exist Because of Heat\nInterestingly enough, even though it is highly intuitive that time is what separates the past from the future, the only law which suggests that there is some kind of a distinction between the past and the future is the law of entropy, the irreversible progress of heat.\nLeave a hot cup of tea, and it will inevitably grow cold in time; it will never get hot again by itself.\nThe same is true with time: it travels only in one direction, but merely because we see some things as irretrievably changed when going forward.\nAnd we can see this only in the irreversible progress of heat.\nMind-blowing and counter-intuitive, right?\nAlso: true.\nOur Universe Is a Special Case\u2014And That\u2019s Why Time Looks the Way It Does\nFascinatingly enough, the only reason why we can differentiate between the past and the present\u2014which, in a much more fundamental sense, don\u2019t really exist\u2014is because we live in a universe whose entropy is low in the past\nAnd only because of this, \u201cthe second law of thermodynamics obtains; memories exist, traces are left\u2014and there can be evolution, life, and thought.\u201d\nIn other words, as strange as it sounds, we\u2019ve won the lottery. And that\u2019s not merely the only reason why time looks to us the way it does\u2014but also (and consequently) the only reason why we exist the way we do and understanding the things the way we understand them.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Order of Time Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nhas been described as \u201ca pocket-sized guide to unraveling the mysteries of time\u201d and as \u201ca deep\u2014and remarkably readable\u2014dive into the fundamental nature of time.\u201d\u00a0\nThe strange thing is that neither of these descriptions is an exaggeration\u2014on the contrary, they may be understatements.\n\u201cMind-bending\u201d (\n) and \u201ccompact\u201d (\n), highly allusive and dizzyingly poetic (\n),\n, in our humble opinion, is the best book on the subject you can find out there.\nPlease do: this book deserves to be read by anyone who is even vaguely interested in the mystery of time."},

And Why?\n\u201cThis book is for anyone who wants to understand the techniques that allow a business to grow from zero to a multibillion-dollar market leader in a handful of years,\u201d write the authors of \n themselves in a chapter that all but shares the title above.\n\u201cWhether you are a founder, a manager, a potential employee, or an investor,\u201d they add, \u201cwe believe that understanding blitzscaling will allow you to make better decisions in a world where speed is the critical competitive advantage.\u201d\nBlitzscaling PDF Summary\n\u201cWhen a start-up matures to the point where it has a killer product, a clear and sizable market, and a robust distribution channel,\u201d writes Reid Hoffman in the \u201cIntroduction\u201d to \n, \u201cit has the opportunity to become a \u2018scale-up,\u2019 which is a world-changing company that touches millions or even billions of lives.\u201d\n\u201cOften,\u201d he adds, \u201cthe fastest and most direct path from start-up to scale-up is the hypergrowth produced by blitzscaling.\u201d\nNever heard that word before?\nWell, that\u2019s where this book and our summary might come in handy.\nAs you have probably already guessed, the authors (Reid Hoffman and Chris Yeah) use this book to introduce the concept of blitzscaling, to go over its advantages and disadvantages, and to explain why \u201cthe key to rapidly building massive businesses in today\u2019s environment is [this] aggressive growth strategy.\u201d\nTo do this, they use quite a lot of lists and sublists; we\u2019ll try to include them all in our summary, but, due to its limited space, we\u2019ll delve into more details only in the case of the most important ones.\nSo, let\u2019s go!\nPART I What Is Blitzscaling?\nAs it should be fairly obvious, \u201cblitzscaling\u201d is a portmanteau of two words: the German \u201cblitz\u201d and the Latin-based English \u201cscaling.\u201d \n, but as far as the former is concerned, you may require some explanation. (That is unless you are a World War II buff, football fan, or, well, English.)\nIn German, \u201cblitz\u201d means \u201clightning\u201d and is the word the British press adopted to describe, in short (from \u201cblitzkrieg\u201d), the brutal, rapid, all-out attacks organized by Nazi Germany\u2019s General Heinz Guderian.\nBy analogy, in football, \u201call-out blitz\u201d defense means sending every available defender to pursue the QB: a risky move which sometimes pays off.\nIt\u2019s the same in business: \n \u201cstrives for a relentless and dizzying speed that overwhelms the market\u201d and can be defined as a framework or a set of specific techniques which allows companies to achieve massive scale at incredible speed.\nBlitzscaling, in other words, means growing at such a fast rate that it makes you dizzy, even uncomfortable.\nIt is one of the \n, which can be best illustrated via this table:\nAs you can probably deduct from the table, blitzscaling means prioritizing speed over efficiency and uncertainty over certainty.\nTo understand it better, it is a good idea to first understand \n:\n1. Blitzscaling is both an offensive strategy and a defensive strategy.\n2. Blitzscaling thrives on positive feedback loops, in that the company that grows to scale first reaps significant competitive advantages.\n3. Despite its incredible advantages and potential payoffs, blitzscaling also comes with massive risks.\nIn addition, these are \n:\n\u2022 Stage 1 (Family): 1\u20139 employees\n\u2022 Stage 2 (Tribe): 10s of employees\n\u2022 Stage 3 (Village): 100s of employees\n\u2022 Stage 4 (City): 1000s of employees\n\u2022 Stage 5 (Nation): 10000s of employees\u00a0\nAnd, finally, these are \n:\n\u2022 Business Model Innovation\n\u2022 Strategy innovation\n\u2022 Management Innovation\nTo mimic the structure of the book, we\u2019ll go over each of these in the following sections.\nPART II Business Model Innovation\n\u201cOf the three core techniques of blitzscaling,\u201d note Hoffman and Yeh, \u201cthe first and most foundational is to design an innovative business model capable of exponential growth.\u201d\n\u201cWhat sets companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook apart,\u201d they go on, \u201c\n, is that they have consistently been able to design and execute business models with characteristics that allow them to quickly achieve massive scale and sustainable competitive advantage.\u201d\nMost of these business models share certain characteristics; and if you want to find \n best business model, it is a good idea to design one which maximizes the four key growth factors and minimizes the two key growth limiters.\u00a0\nThe four growth factors are the following:\n: this is, of course, the most basic growth factor; either find an already large or a fast-growing market; otherwise, blitzscaling is, by definition, impossible;\n: the cold and unromantic fact is that, even if you have an \u201cinsanely great\u201d product and just poor distribution, a good product with great distribution will always beat you; the distribution techniques to consider fall into two general categories:\n\u2022 \n (PayPal used eBay, Airbnb \u2013 Craigslist);\n\u2022 \n(which must be free or freemium: \u201cWe can\u2019t recall a single instance of a company that grew to a massive scale by leveraging the virality of a paid product.\u201d)\n: as you know, gross margins = sales \u2013 the cost of goods sold; the higher they are, the better things are in the long run. (\u201cMany high-tech businesses have high gross margins by default, which is why this factor is often overlooked. Software businesses have high gross margins because the cost of duplicating software is essentially zero.\u201d)\n: #1 to #3 are important factors in growing a company, but #4 is the one which \nthis growth long enough so that you can build a lasting and massively valuable franchise. According to Arun Sundararajan, there are 5 broad categories of network effects:\n\u2022 \n: Increases in usage leads to direct increases in value (Facebook, WhatsApp);\n\u2022 \n: Increases in usage encourages consumption of complementary goods, which, in turn, increases the value of the original product (the adoption of an operating system encourages third-party app developers to build apps for that system)\n\u2022 \n: Increases in usage by one set of users increases the value to a different set of complementary users, and vice versa. (eBay, Uber, and Airbnb)\n\u2022 \n: Increases in usage by a small subset of users increases the value for a connected user. (Remember that time when you could specify a limited number of favorite numbers whom you could call for free?)\n\u2022 \n: The use of one technology product encourages the use of compatible products. (Microsoft Office encouraged people to use the Office suite)\n\u201cBuilding key growth factors into your innovative business model is only half the battle,\u201d note Hoffman and Yeh. \u201cIt is fiendishly difficult to grow an amazing business, in part because it is fiendishly easy to run smack into obstacles that limit your growth. A key component of business model innovation is designing around these growth limiters.\u201d\nThere are two growth limiters that you must build around if you want to blitzscale:\n: \u201cProduct/market fit,\u201d wrote \n a while back, \u201cmeans being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.\u201d Obvious as it sounds, many people seem to forget that without a good product/market fit, it is impossible to grow a start-up into a successful business.\n \u2013 the bigger the company, the more people you need (human limitations) and the bulkier the nonhuman part should be (infrastructure limitations); even with smart tactics, you can\u2019t delay the problems forever.\nA proven business model pattern means a sequence of steps which proves successful in more than one case. This is a list of seven such models:\nGoogle and Facebook are a great example of this: bits-based businesses have fewer variable costs, high gross margins, and make it easier to design the business model \n growth limiters. Bits, simply put, are iterative and easier to move around than atoms.\n \nSoftware-based platforms can achieve global distribution almost immediately. Amazon\u2019s merchant platform, Facebook\u2019s social graph, and, of course, Apple\u2019s iOS ecosystem are great examples of the power of platforms.\nAs \n, free products would almost always end up bringing users, and the interested ones would almost always upgrade to a paid version if happy with the product.\nLocal market places have been a valuable business model ever since time immemorial; the Internet allowed them to become Airbnb, eBay, Google.\nSubscription allows great distribution with no effort: that\u2019s why software-as-a-service (\n) is becoming the dominant model for streaming entertainment and enterprise software.\u00a0\nThis sits at the intersection of #1 and #2 and works with intangible products with practically no intrinsic value: the messaging service LINE, for example, derives significant revenues by selling \u201cstickers.\u201d\nOne of the most underrated and underappreciated proven patterns is the news feed: \n.\n\u201cUnderlying the proven patterns of business model innovation are larger principles that can help refine those patterns or even create new ones,\u201d write Hoffman and Yeh. \u201cThese principles aren\u2019t themselves business models, but they often power the technological innovation that enables business model innovation.\u201d\nPut otherwise, \n:\n\u2022 \n, i.e., predict the future of technology\n\u2022 \n, i.e., automate everything that can be automated\n\u2022 \n, i.e., constantly improve\n\u2022 \n, aka \nPART III Strategy Innovation\n\u201cTo blitzscale or not to blitzscale is a strategic (and difficult) choice,\u201d warn Hoffman and Yeh at the beginning of the third part of \n.\nSo, when should you blitzscale?\nThe answer may give you these \n:\n\u2022 \n: it often arises because a technological innovation creates a new market or scrambles an existing one (e.g., YouTube appeared when the networks were finally big enough to stream video).\n\u2022 \n: \u201cThe most frequent offensive reason for blitzscaling is to achieve a critical mass that confers a lasting competitive advantage.\u201d (e.g., Uber, Airbnb)\n\u2022 \n: if you can be the first to climb a steep learning curve, blitzscale (e.g., Netflix and self-driving cars)\n\u2022 \n: if you want to leave your competitors in the dust (e.g., Netflix going into debt to create new content so as to drive his competitors out of the game)\n\u2022 \n: sometimes, blitzscaling works even in less than hot markets (Google during the dot-com bubble)\n\u2022 \nThere are also a few \n\u2022 Declining rate of growth (relative to the market and competition)\n\u2022 Worsening unit economics\n\u2022 Decreasing per-employee productivity \n\u2022 Increasing management overhead\nOf course, even if you \n blitzscale, it doesn\u2019t mean that you \n. But it seems that\u2019s \n best strategy for our modern times.\nAnd it updates \n\u2019s 3-step scaling process (from his 2013 essay \u201cDo Things That Don\u2019t Scale\u201d):\n\u2022 Step 1: Do things that don\u2019t scale.\n\u2022 Step 2: Achieve scale.\n\u2022 Step 3: Do things that scale.\n\u2014into this \n:\n\u2022 Step 1: Do things that don\u2019t scale.\n\u2022 Step 2: Reach the next stage of blitzscaling.\n\u2022 Step 3: Figure out how to do one set of things that scale, while somehow also finding a way to do a completely different set of things that don\u2019t scale.\n\u2022 Step 4: Reach the next stage of blitzscaling.\n\u2022 Step 5: Repeat over and over until you reach complete market dominance.\nOf course, \n changes in each of the stages of growth :\n\u2022 Stage 1 (Family): the founder personally pulls the levers of hypergrowth\n\u2022 Stage 2 (Tribe): the founder manages the people who are pulling the levers\n\u2022 Stage 3 (Village): the founder designs an organization that pulls the levers\n\u2022 Stage 4 (City): the founder makes high-level decisions about goals and strategies\n\u2022 Stage 5 (Nation): the founder figures out how to pull the organization back from blitzscaling and start blitzscaling new product lines and business units\nPART IV Management Innovation\n\u201cOne of the key features that sets global giants apart from those companies that flame out or implode before they can reach market dominance,\u201d write Hoffman and Yeh, \u201cis an ability to evolve and optimize their management practices at each stage of growth.\u201d\nThe proven techniques here fall into two main categories: eight key transitions (\u201cwhich help guide the company through the stages of blitzscaling\u201d), and nine counterintuitive rules (\u201cwhich turn the conventional wisdom of traditional management on its head in order to cope with blitzscaling\u2019s frenzied pace of growth.\u201d)\nThese are the 8 key transitions you should consider when you blitzscale:\nThis is the first and most obvious blitzscaling transition: when you go from tribe to village, it is almost impossible to keep a small team anymore.\nDuring the village stage, it is a necessity to hire specialists and turn some of the generalists you already have into specialists so that you sustain your growth.\nExecutives are the ones who lead the managers who are, in turn, all about the day-to-day tactics. When you\u2019re blitzscaling, the ideal is to hire executives with past blitzscaling experience, which is, of course, also the reason why investors have more confidence in serial entrepreneurs.\nIf you can\u2019t hire someone like that, then use this three-step process:\n1. Hire someone who is already a known quantity to at least one member of the team.\n2. Bring the new executive in at a lower level initially and let the executive prove himself or herself.\n3. Once the executive has earned the team\u2019s trust and credibility, consider promoting him or her.\nAt the Family stage, the whole company is working under one roof, possibly even one room, so communication is not the problem. However, as early as the Tribe stage, you need company meetings.\u00a0\nAt the Village stage, the company exceeds the Dunbar\u2019s number, so the founder needs to find creative ways to broadcast the messages to far-flung employees and keep their morale high as well.\nAt the early stages, it\u2019s all about inspiration and passion. At the village stage, they need to make space for data-driven approaches: almost all village-size businesses who have blitzscaled have used dashboards to assess the progress of their companies.\n\u201cStart-ups in the early stages of blitzscaling are generally single-product companies that focus on doing one thing extremely well. But to keep the company growing in the later stages, scale-ups need to manage multiple product lines or even business units.\u201d\nAt the\n\u201cNation\u201d stage, it is important to start acquiring other start-ups: this is when you transform your offense into a specific type of defense. You have a lasting competitive advantage? Restructure so that you don\u2019t allow your competitors space to narrow the gap.\nIf you are the founder of a blitzscaling start-up, you need to blitzscale yourself. There are only three ways to scale yourself: delegation, amplification, and just plain making yourself better.\nThese are the 9 counterintuitive rules of blitzscaling:\nTo quote Hoffman and Yeh, \u201centrepreneurs should always have a Plan\u00a0A, a Plan\u00a0B, and a Plan\u00a0Z.\u201d\nPlan A is your best current plan; Plan\u00a0B is an alternate plan, and Plan\u00a0Z is your fallback plan for surviving a worst-case scenario.\u00a0\n\u201cABZ planning gives you multiple opportunities to recover from mistakes or setbacks.\u201d\n\u201cHiring someone who has been managing a thousand people to run a ten-person company is actually counterproductive,\u201d write Hoffman and Yeh, \u201cbecause the skills needed to succeed during those two phases are very different.\u201d So, instead of Ms. Right, hire Ms. Right Now, \u201cNow\u201d referring to the stage of your development.\nThis\nshould be obvious by definition: in blitzscaling, speed is more important than having a \u201cwell-run\u201d organization.\nIf you need to choose between the perfect product tomorrow and the imperfect product today\u2014always choose the latter.\nPrioritize\nyour problems\nusing Hoffman and Yeh\u2019s Maslovian hierarchy of fires:\u00a0 #1 Distribution; #2 Product; #3. Revenue model; #4. Operations; #5 Competition; #6What\u2019s next?\n\u201cTo prioritize speed, you might invest less in security, write code that isn\u2019t scalable, and wait for things to start breaking before you build QA tools and processes,\u201d note Hoffman and Yeh.\nOf course, all of this will bring you problems later on, but by then you\u2019ll have billions of dollars to solve them.\u00a0\nTo sum up, \u201ca hack that takes a tenth of the time may be more useful than an elegantly engineered solution, even if it has to be thrown away later.\u201d\nReally: it seems that most of the blitzscaling start-ups that have grown into multi-billion corporation offer no support or only email support at the beginning, hoping that users would find and help each other on wiki-based encyclopedias and/or discussion forums.\nRaise enough cash for 2 years of operations: see the example of Netflix.\nIgnoring your customers\nis good, but Ignoring your own culture is never an option. Invest both time and resources \n and become a brand!\nPART V The Broader Landscape of Blitzscaling\nThe last two parts of \n are comparatively not as important as the first four parts so we\u2019ll just breeze through them.\nIn Part V, Hoffman and Ye go over the \n(scale, iteration, longevity, mergers & acquisitions) and the \n(incentives, unstaged commitment, public market pressure) \n \nThen they offer these established companies three blitzscaling hacks:\n\u2022 Find ways to leverage people and businesses with prior Blitzscaling experience;\n\u2022 Leverage the knowledge of venture capitalists;\n\u2022 Treat the new initiative as a company within a company.\nFinally, after introducing the readers to China as \u201cThe Land of Blitzscaling,\u201d they go over the three options the companies who compete against blitzscalers have at their disposal to defend: beat them, join them, or avoid them until they collapse.\nPART VI Responsible Blitzscaling\nIn the final part, Hoffman and Yeh talk about the other side of the coin of blitzscaling: as with all other growth processes, you are responsible for much more than your company and the profits, but also for how your business impacts society and humanity in general.\nKey Lessons from \u201cBlitzscaling\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Blitzscaling Is the New Scaling\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If Blitzscaling, There Are Four Growth Factors and Two Growth Limiters to Consider \n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 There Are Seven Proven Business Model Blitzscaling Patterns\nBlitzscaling Is the New Scaling\nYou can scale up in several different ways. If you\u2019re going for speed and uncertainty rather than efficiency and certainty, then you\u2019re blitzscaling.\nBlitzscaling means trying to create a lasting competitive advantage through several specific techniques, which are risky but which, in the long run, may lead to you trampling over your competition.\nIf Blitzscaling, There Are Four Growth Factors and Two Growth Limiters to Consider\u00a0\nIf you are blitzscaling, you should consider these four growth factors:\u00a0\n\u2022 Market size\n\u2022 Distribution\n\u2022 High gross margins\n\u2022 Network effects\nHowever, you should also build around the two growth limitations:\n\u2022 Lack of product/market fit\n\u2022 Operational scalability\nThere Are Seven Proven Business Model Blitzscaling Patterns\nThere are seven proven business model blitzscaling patterns:\n\u2022 Bits rather than atoms (Google, Facebook)\n\u2022 Platforms (Amazon, Apple\u2019s iOS ecosystem)\n\u2022 Free or Freemium (Dropbox)\n\u2022 Marketplaces (Airbnb, eBay)\n\u2022 Subscriptions (Netflix)\n\u2022 Digital goods (LINE and stickers)\n\u2022 Feeds (Twitter)\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nBlitzscaling Quotes\nFinal Notes\nmay not be a book about everybody\u2014for not every company is a Google or a Facebook\u2014but it is definitely a book about established companies with a great product/market fit.\nIn fact, it may be the best one: after all, Reid Hoffman is the guy who co-founded PayPal and LinkedIn, in addition to being an angel investor in Facebook.\u00a0\nSo, you do the math if you want to hear his advice when it comes to scaling up.\n\u201cThe case studies you\u2019re about to explore, and the tools you\u2019re about to gain have never been more relevant,\u201d writes Bill Gates in the \u201cForeword.\u201d \u201cThis is an ideal moment to be reading this book,\u201d he adds."},

And Why?\nContrary to what you might deduce from the title, this is not a book about freelancers, nor is it a book about successful small businesses that want to find ways to grow. (If you want that, consult books such as \n).\nCounterintuitively, \n is about businesses that want to \ngrowing, and people who want to build their work lives around their personal lives\u2014and not the other way around.\nIf you don\u2019t want to be big, but sustainable, if you don\u2019t want to build a multi-billion industry but work a limited number of hours and spend more time with your friends and family\u2014well, then, Paul Jarvis\u2019 book is the one of the best ones you can find on the market.\nCompany of One Summary\nApparently, it is not only Ludwig Mies van der Rohe\u2019s followers or \n who believe sincerely that \u201cless is more.\u201d Counter-intuitively, this is more and more becoming the ethos of many modern businessmen as well!\nIn \n, Paul Jarvis explains why this shouldn\u2019t surprise nobody\u2014and gives pointers on how you should hop on the \u201cenough is enough\u201d bandwagon as soon as possible!\nDefining a Company of One\nPut in the simplest terms possible, a company of one is a business that questions growth.\n\u201cA company of one,\u201d explains further Jarvis, \u201cresists and questions some forms of traditional growth, not on principle, but because growth isn\u2019t always the most beneficial or financially viable move.\u201d\nHowever, make no mistake: a company of one doesn\u2019t mean a small company per se.\nAlthough a company of one can be a small business owner or a small group of founders, it can also be a set of principles which big business \n adopt if they \u201cwant to keep their brightest minds in their employ.\u201d \nAnd that is because these \u201ccompany of one principles\u201d mean self-sufficiency and more autonomy\u2014and that is precisely what most employees, executive leaders, board members, and corporate leaders want today.\n\u201cTechnically,\u201d concludes Jarvis, \u201ceveryone should be a company of one,\u201d because being a company of one means having a mindset to build a business around \n life, and not the other way around.\nCompanies of one, according to Jarvis, share four typical traits:\n\u2022 \n: \n, resilient companies\u2014and since they are companies of one, read: \n\u2014 are down-to-earth (they \n and are not preys to wishful thinking), are \n, and all this because they have \n.\n\u2022 \n: Being a company of one puts you in control\u2014you are the one who makes the deadlines, and the one who accepts/rejects offers. This gives you more autonomy and control over your own life.\n\u2022 \n: Companies of one work faster because \u201cthey have less of the corporate mass that often gets in the way.\u201d\n\u2022 \n: Larger companies are more complex; for companies of one, simplicity is mandatory.\nCompanies of One vs. Small Businesses vs. Freelancing\nAs one of our school teachers used to say: even better than defining something of its own accord is defining it in relation to a few similar things; that way, you\u2019ll understand it better by seeing what it is \n.\nAnd companies of one are neither small business nor a fancy for freelancer.\nThe difference between a company of one and a small business\u2014as you\u2019re about to see\u2014is fairly simple: small business like to grow, and companies of one don\u2019t.\nUnlike small businesses that stay small merely because they are unable to grow, companies of one are able to grow but stay small by their own choice.\nIf given an opportunity to grow, a small business would accept it, no questions asked; a real company of one would decline it\u2014because it thinks of growth in much the same manner it thinks of decline.\nFor small businesses, the definition of success is a variation of the motto \u201cbigger is better;\u201d for companies of one, success means \u201csustaining a \n level of income\u201d and nothing more.\nThat being said, both small business and companies of one invest money to produce something which should return them more money in the future. And that is the big difference between companies of one and freelancers.\nFor freelancers, the equation \u201ctime is money\u201d is quite literal: they earn money only while they work. The moment they stop working, the money stops coming their way. \nCompanies of one earn money off of their products, which means that they have a passive income as well.\nIn short, a freelancer designs a t-shirt and sells the design to her client (one-time transaction). A company of one designs a t-shirt\u2014and sells that designed t-shirt to multiple clients for years to come (passive income).\nStaying Small as an End Goal\nWe know that all this still seems as some anti-capitalistic, utopian pipedream. But it \n happening as you read this summary\u2014and to prove it, we will go over one of the many examples Jarvis lists in his book.\nPsychotactics is a company which provides psychology-related consultancy services to business, and which is run by a certain Sean D\u2019Souza. \nNow, D\u2019Souza doesn\u2019t want to grow his company.\nHe decided some time ago that $500,000 a year of profit was all he wanted to earn and that his business \n exceed it. And that\u2019s precisely how much Psychotactics earns (through training workshops and its website).\nCounterintuitively to everything you know about business, Sean is \n interested in reaching his target limit, \n exceeding it.\nWhy?\nBecause he thinks of his business as a corollary to his life and not the other way around. \nPut simply, he started with sketching out the optimal life he wanted to lead (\u201ccomplete with taking a three-month vacation each year with his wife and spending hours walking, cooking, and teaching and tutoring his two young nieces each day\u201d), and then built his company around this goal.\nAnd when he reached it, he realized something \n (and something which most business owners never do): \n.\nIn other words, if you want to earn more money, you\u2019ve got to brace yourself for more problems: more profits mean more customers which means more employees which means more bureaucracy, etc. etc. \nThis, of course, means more work time for you, and that defeats the whole purpose of starting a company. After all, what\u2019s the point of earning millions if have no time to spend it on the things you like?\nTurn this on its head\u2014and you have a company of one.\nQuitting Your Job Is Not the First Step\nAt this point, you might think the title of this section is some sort of a joke: how would you ever build a successful company of one if you stay stuck in your corporate \u00e0-la-\njob?\nWell, the truth is, of course, you won\u2019t. However, quitting your job should only come \n you\u2019ve developed something to work with.\nTake, for example, Tom Fishburne, the very first guy Paul Jarvis mentions in \n.\nHe had a great career by all standards, managing to climb the corporate ladder to become the vice president of marketing at a large consumer foods company.\nHowever, he didn\u2019t really like his job: his passion had always been drawing cartoons. In fact, he was kind of successful at this even at Harvard, but since he was part of the SITCOM demographic (Single Income Two Children Oppressive Mortgage), he figured he needed something more stable and took a job in the corporate world.\nHis friends, fortunately, still liked his cartoons, and since drawing them was Tom\u2019s passion, he didn\u2019t stop sharing them long after taking the job.\nThese friends of Tom told some friends of theirs, and \n told some of \n friends. Eventually, Tom got his first client. When he managed to line up a few of them, in 2010, he quit his job as the VP.\n\u201cThis turned out to be Tom\u2019s best career move,\u201d writes Jarvis, \u201cboth emotionally and, surprisingly, financially.\u201d\nSo, that\u2019s the first lesson: quit your job only after you\u2019ve already built something to start from.\nAs Susy Moore noted, a side hustle can change your life.\nSo, ask yourself, with her: \n?\nPassion Is Not Enough\u2014You Need an Audience as Well\nTo stay with Susie Moore, there\u2019s a catch to the idea of turning your passion into cash. And you might be able to figure it out yourself just by reading the following two paragraphs.\nIn 2003, as summed up in his article \u201c\n,\u201d Robert Vallerand did a wide-ranging study of college students at the University of Quebec. His goal\u2013to find out their passions. \nWhat he discovered was pretty staggering: most of the students were \npassionate about one of these three things: arts, music, and sports.\nDid you realize the catch?\nIf not, consider this as well: only 3 percent of all jobs can be found in the sports, music, and art industries!\nIn other words, no matter how passionate you are about these things, chances are you\u2019re never going to become the next Serena Williams, Beyonc\u00e9 or \n, for the very same reason that a whole class can\u2019t become the next President of the United States.\nSimply put, there are too few jobs for too many passionate people.\n\u201cFollow your passion,\u201d concludes Jarvis, \u201cis irresponsible business advice.\u201d\nWhat is a responsible one is this: if you want to build a company of one, follow that passion that produces commodities which other people are willing to pay for.\nAnd that sometimes means making compromises.\nFor example, if you are passionate about drawing, and you believe you\u2019re good at it, then why not follow Paul Jarvis\u2019 path and try a career in web design?\nDrawing is not marketable, but web design is. As a web designer, you can find a job straight away, and easily \n before powering up and evolving into a company of one.\nKeywords: Audience, Niche, Retention\nAs you can realize by now, building a successful company of one is almost always all about being as practical as you can.\nRemember: the goal is to build the life you\u2019ve always dreamed about, and not the company you won\u2019t stop working for.\nThat\u2019s why, investing large sums upfront is not a good idea\u2014start as an intrapreneur, develop your side gig while you earn money from someplace else, and focus on finding a way to make more money as quickly as possible by yourself.\nThat, of course, starts with finding your audience. \nHowever, since you\u2019re not aiming high\u2014and don\u2019t want to build a big million-dollar company\u2014you\u2019re freer to find precisely the right people to be your customers.\nThink about it this way.\nStarbucks started off as a coffee company for one specific type of audience: cool, young people. As the money started pouring in, the company realized that it could scale faster by adding CDs, sandwiches, and fancier drinks to its menu.\nThe result?\nThe rapid expansion diluted the Starbucks brand, and before you could say \u201cone coffee to go\u201d please, 900 Starbucks stores off they went.\nStarbucks learned the hard way that bigger isn\u2019t always better, and that retaining customers is always much smarter than looking for new ones; because, then, there\u2019s a chance that you might lose the existing ones.\nNow, you\u2019re building a company of one: you have the \nof focusing on smaller and more specific target audience.\nThis brings more trust and more loyalty, and eventually, it means more chance for \n.\nAnd that\u2019s great because if your existing customers bring you enough money, then retaining them is enough to keep you going.\nWhat more could you want?\nKey Lessons from \u201cCompany of One\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Company of One Is a Business That Questions Growth\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Evolve Your Side Gig into a Company of One (Works If You\u2019re a Freelancer as Well)\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Be Passionate\u2014But Practical as Well\nA Company of One Is a Business That Questions Growth\nIn business, growth is, more or less, a by-product of success. However, a company of one doesn\u2019t care much about how things are supposed to work. Or, better, yet\u2014it isn\u2019t interested in following these conventional rules.\n\u201cA company of one is simply a business that \n growth,\u201d writes Paul Jarvis, and goes on to explain that, contrary to traditional knowledge, \u201cgrowth isn\u2019t always the most beneficial or financially viable move.\u201d\nHow, you might ask.\nWell, it\u2019s simple really: when you\u2019re satisfied with where you\u2019re at (not only with work but also with free time, autonomy, self-sufficiency), just stop there.\nMore money brings more problems\u2014and you don\u2019t need them.

And Why?\nEveryone has problems; and everyone wants to solve them.\nConsequently, everyone needs to learn techniques to solve his/her problems; especially if these are proven to work and are as neatly described and explained as in Ken Watanabe\u2019s \n.\nA great book for both kids and adults, realists and dreamers, students and business owners, followers and leaders.\nProblem Solving 101 Summary\nWe all have to make decisions. \nAnd that is true regardless of who you are: a kid, a student, a businessman or the President of the United States. \nThe only thing that varies is the type of the problem.\nFor some, it is how to pass a math class, for others a decision on where to live, and for yet a third person devising a plan on how to improve his/her company\u2019s bottom line; or, maybe, simply you want to lose some weight or get better at golf.\nNow, whether the issue is big or small, says Ken Watanabe in \n, \u201cthere\u2019s a fundamental approach to solving these real-life problems, one that can consistently lead you to effective and satisfying solutions.\u201d\nIf you need that sentence rephrased, here it is: problem-solving is a skill, and just like riding a bike \u2013 \nbe learned.\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what this book is all about.\nOriginally written for Japanese schoolchildren, \nquickly gained popularity far beyond its target group, becoming not only Japan\u2019s number one business best-seller in 2007 but also an international hit.\nHence, the English edition and its subtitle: \u201ca simple book for smart people.\u201d\nThe Case Studies\nnot only introduces its readers to the basics of the problem-solving approach, but it also offers \u201ca full toolbox of proven problem-solving techniques, the same techniques used by successful problem-solving people and companies all over the world.\u201d\nTo illustrate how the steps work in practice, Watanabe uses three case studies:\n\u2022 The Mushroom Lovers, a new band trying to improve their concert attendance numbers;\n\u2022 John Octopus, a bright young man with aspirations of becoming a computer graphics animator who needs to buy his first computer;\n\u2022 Kiwi, an aspiring soccer player looking for the best training school in Brazil.\nNow, we don\u2019t have enough space in our summary to go over each of these case studies, so we genuinely advise you to buy the book as soon as possible and read them in their entirety. Coupled with some quirky illustrations and an abundance of graphics, \nis really a joy to read, own and share.\nBut, back to our job.\nThe Four Steps of Problem Solving\nIn its essence, problem-solving is a process that can be broken down into four steps: (1) understand the current situation; (2) identify the root cause of the problem; (3) develop an effective action plan; and (4) execute until the problem is solved, making modifications as necessary.\n\u201cThese steps come as a package,\u201d warns Watanabe, before he goes on to clarify:\n\u201cBefore you can solve anything, you first need to realize that there\u2019s a problem. Once you do, identifying the root cause of the problem isn\u2019t enough. You have to think through how you could fix the problem, and then actually take the actions required to fix it.\u201d\n\u201cProblem solving is a combination of thinking and acting,\u201d he concludes. \u201cJust doing one or the other won\u2019t get you anywhere.\u201d\nSo, let\u2019s have a look at each of the four steps of problem-solving in full.\nThe first step of solving a problem is understanding it; though it sounds simple \u2013 and, in a way, it \nsimple \u2013 it is actually something most people do wrong (\u201cThe catch is that we often don\u2019t do what seems simple and obvious,\u201d writes Watanabe.)\nSo, let\u2019s just say that you are a soccer player who wants to improve your soccer skills; you spend more and more time on the field to do that and, in the meantime, your math grades decline.\nIf you (like 99% of the people) simply say \u201cI have to quit the soccer team, so I have more time to study math,\u201d you haven\u2019t really understood the situation.\nAs a consequence, there\u2019s a good chance that even after this drastic action, your math grades would remain bad. \nWhy?\nBecause to understand the situation, you need to go much deeper than this. \nDo other kids play soccer as well? Are their grades as bad as yours? If not \u2013 i.e., if there are at least a few kids who train with you and whose grades haven\u2019t deteriorated \u2013 then is soccer really the problem?\nWhich brings us to step #2: identifying the root cause of the problem. Of course, to do that, you first need to list all the possible problems.\nLet\u2019s simplify the problem by eliminating soccer practice from the equation; or let\u2019s just say that you don\u2019t want to give up soccer or that your math grades have been bad from the start. \nTo identify the root cause of your problem, you need to break down the problem to its elementary parts. A good way to do this is by asking yourself the simple question: \u201c\u201cWhat types of math problems am I getting wrong?\u201d\nNow, it\u2019s time to break the questions into categories \u2013 like algebra, fractions, and geometry \u2013 and compare the scores between categories.\nWho knows what you\u2019ll discover now?\nIt could be that your scores in fractions and algebra are flat, but it is your geometry scores that are giving the impression that math is not your cup of tea. In other words,\njust looking at the average trend of the math grades as a whole won\u2019t help you see what is really happening.\nThis will because you can break down the categories even further, going from geometry problems to problems with area and volume.\nDo this until you reach the atomic parts of your problem. \nAnd then move on to the next step.\nThe first two steps of the problem-solving approach will take you from \u201cMy math grades are going down, and I should quit soccer and study more math\u201d to \u201cMy math grades are going down because I am not doing well in three topics: trapezoid area, cylinder volume, and Pythagorean theorem application.\u201d\nNeedless to say, this latter formulation makes all the difference. Now, you are ready to develop an effective action plan, the result of which will be significantly different.\nBecause once you identify the root cause of the problem, the solution writes itself. \u201cI need to study more math\u201d is not an action plan; however, I need to revise the lessons about cylinder volume on Monday and solve a few Pythagorean theorem equations on Tuesday is.\nAs you can see, in this second-case scenario, you\u2019ll know not only what to study, but how much time you\u2019ll need to study it.\nSuddenly, it becomes more than clear that soccer practice was never really the problem.\nBut the problem-solving process doesn\u2019t end there; of course, once you devise an action plan, it\u2019s only natural that you need to start executing it.\nWould you just start waking up half an hour earlier or go to sleep half an hour later every day to practice the types of problems pointed above? \nIt\u2019s up to you!\nBut once you start doing that, you\u2019ll start seeing the results of your action plan as well.\nAnd you know what?\nThey may not mean better grades.\nThis calls for modifications: maybe half an hour is not enough; or maybe you need some help from your parents, your teacher, or your friends; modify as necessary until you have something to work with.\nAnd when you don\u2019t have that anymore \u2013 start the process once again from Step #1.\nMaybe you didn\u2019t understand the situation well enough; even more probably, you may have not guessed the root cause of your problems. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a string of geometry problems, but your inability to understand abstract concepts; or maybe it was your outdated or complex textbook.\nBut you know what?\nAfter you\u2019ve gone through the problem-solving process once, the second time you\u2019re less likely to make a mistake \u2013 both with your identification and, consequently, your action plan.\nProblem-Solving Tool Box\nTo ease your way around the problem-solving process, Ken Watanabe offers a toolbox of problem-solving methods which can help you identify the root cause of your problems and/or devise an appropriate and efficient action plan to eliminate it.\nWatanabe defines a logic tree as \u201ca visual tool that helps when you are trying to identify all the potential root causes of a problem and generate a wide variety of solutions.\u201d\nAnd it is exactly what you think it is: a branched-out tree which helps you visualize the subclasses \u2013 \n \u2013 of your main problem.\nWhy should you do that?\nBecause, \n, language is not precise enough; also, it prevents you from seeing the whole image.\nYou already know how a logic tree looks like, but just to remind you: the trunk of math is branched into algebra, fractions, and geometry, the branch of geometry further into the branches of area and volume, and the branch of volume into cylinder volume, etc. etc.\nNow, go make one for \n problem!\nA yes/no tree is basically a specific kind of a logic tree.\n\u201cA yes/no tree,\u201d writes Watanabe, \u201cgroups people or objects into buckets based on the answers to yes/no questions. By assigning everyone and everything involved to a bucket, you can more clearly see what the core issue is.\u201d\nBy creating a yes/no tree, you structure the problem into all of its possible outcomes and generate a complete overview.\nAnd that makes things \n easier.\nThe logic tree and the yes/no tree should help you a lot to understand your situation and identify all of the probable causes for your problems.\nHowever, in order to identify your root cause and devise an action plan, you need to use the third device in Ken Watanabe\u2019s magical toolbox: problem-solving design plan.\nIt is basically a table with five columns.\nIn the first you list all of the possible issues; in the second one, your hypothesis as to why these issues exist; in the third column insert a rationale for each issue; the fourth column is reserved for analysis/activities; the fifth one is optional: here you can put an information source (like a survey or an interview).\nWith a problem-solving design plan, you\u2019ll spend less time \n, and more time \nthings.\n\u201cThe hypothesis pyramid is a great tool for structuring your argument,\u201d writes Watanabe. \n\u201cUsing it to clarify your conclusion and rationale before diving into data collection and analysis will improve your productivity dramatically. It\u2019s also useful for communicating your hypothesis to others.\u201d\n\u00a0The basic structure of a hypothesis pyramid is simple.\nIt places the conclusion/main message at the top and lists all the supporting rationales below, like the supporting bricks of a pyramid.\nIt\u2019s basically each of the rows in a problem-design solving plan broken down further.\nThere are two tools that are very helpful when you need to evaluate multiple options and select the best one.\nThe first one is \n: the pros and cons list.\nTo make one, you just need to follow these four simple steps:\n#1. List all the options.\n#2. List the pros and cons of each of the options.\n#3. Weight each of the positive and negative points you listed. (Put, say, three pluses if it is a very attractive pro, and three minuses if it is very unattractive; and distribute the pros and cons between these two extremes; you can use a five-star rating as well, or a grading system from 0 to 5).\n#4. Select the most attractive option.\nYou can use the criteria and emulation tool \u201cto clarify which criteria, or qualifications, you should use to evaluate your options, decide the importance of each set of criteria, and effectively evaluate your options.\u201d\nThe steps are:\n#1. List all the options.\n#2. List the evaluation criteria. (For example, if you\u2019re a soccer player choosing a school: a) quality of education; b) strength of the soccer team; c) distance to school; d) friends, etc.)\n#3. Decide the degree of importance of each criterion. (Use three levels: from low to high).\n#4. Evaluate each option based on the weighted criteria. (See #3 above.)\n#5. Select the most attractive option.\nKey Lessons from \u201cProblem Solving 101\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Problem Solving Is a Skill \u2013 and It Can Be Learned\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Problem Solving Is a 4-Step Process\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Use These Instruments from Watanabe\u2019s Problem-Solving Tool Box!\nProblem Solving Is a Skill \u2013 and It Can Be Learned\n\u201cProblem solving isn\u2019t a talent limited to the lucky few,\u201d writes Ken Watanabe at the beginning of the book\u2019s first chapter. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a skill and a habit that you can learn.\u201d\nIf your question is \u201cthen why don\u2019t we learn this skill at school\u201d \u2013 well, congratulations: you\u2019ve just discovered the reason why Watanabe wrote this book in the first place.\nHe writes:\n\u201cAlthough Japanese business leaders, educators, and politicians have long talked about the need for Japan to shift from \u2018memorization-focused education\u2019 to \u2018problem-solving-focused education,\u2019 no one had figured out a concrete and effective way to make this happen.\u201d\nis Watanabe\u2019s attempt.\nAnd based on the reaction (of both Japan and the world) \u2013 it works.\nProblem Solving Is a 4-Step Process\nTo master problem-solving, you just need to master these four steps: \n#1. Understand the current situation;\n#2. Identify the root cause of the problem;\n#3. Develop an effective action plan; and \n#4. Execute until the problem is solved, making modifications as necessary.\nUse These Instruments from Watanabe\u2019s Problem-Solving Tool Box!\nAnd to master the four steps of Watanabe\u2019s problem-solving approach, you need no more than these six problem-solving instruments:\n#1.

Recommended for anyone struggling to live a financially comfortable life.\nThe Barefoot Investor Summary\n\u201cWithout my knowledge or approval,\u201d writes Scott Pape in the \u201cPrelude\u201d to \n, \u201cthe Department of Environment and Primary Industries had rolled up at first light and begun destroying my surviving sheep. Apparently, they can do that when your farm is declared part of a disaster zone.\u201d\n\u201cTwo chimneys and a pile of rubble were the sum total of a lifetime of possessions,\u201d he adds, after witnessing with his wife Liz the destruction. \u201cHer wedding dress. Tea cups. The few last remaining photos of her late father, who had died 10 years earlier. Butter knives. All of my baby son\u2019s clothes. All of his toys. Everything was gone.\u201d\nAnd when everything was falling apart, three words came to the mind of Pape: \u201cI\u2019ve got this.\u201d That\u2019s when the idea for this book was born.\nIt\u2019s also the moment when another idea came to Pape\u2019s mind: to plant an apple tree.\nBecause that\u2019s where everything starts.\nAnd it\u2019s a process afterward.\n\u201cAfter all,\u201d Scott writes, \u201cyou don\u2019t plant an apple tree on a Saturday and then come back on Sunday and stand with your hands on your hips and scowl: \u2018Where are my freaking apples?\u2019\u201d\nWhat you do instead is quite simple: you just plant the tree and wait. 30 years later, your sapling will transform into a\u201d big, beautiful tree with thick, strong branches that you attach a rope to as a swing for your grandkids to play on. And the apples feed your entire family.\u201d\nWhy?\nBecause that\u2019s how nature works: plant \u2192 grow \u2192 harvest.\nWell, that\u2019s how money works as well. And \nis here to take you through the whole process.\nBonus: \n.\nBut \u2013 to our job.\nPart 1: Plant\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to get your hands dirty\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s how Pape introduces his journey to wealth. And then he demonstrates, in three steps, how you can \nthe seeds of your future wealth.\nMost people overestimate what they can achieve in one year money-wise, but underestimate what they can achieve in half a dozen years.\nSo that you do not become one of them, a good place to start is, well, with a date.\nMay it be your partner, your friend, your special friend, or even yourself \u2013 but the monthly Barefoot date night is a prerogative.\nFor three reasons:\n. \nTrue, it may seem like such a silly idea, but Scott Pape promises you that, in time, you\u2019ll grow to like them so much that you\u2019ll look forward to them.\nIf you want to make a good family financial plan, then you need your partner on board. You\u2019ve got to work together and the Barefoot date nights make that possible. If you\u2019re single \u2013 don\u2019t worry: then you don\u2019t have to play the partner mind games: you only need to look after yourself.\nTrue, there are many people and books which say the opposite, but, even truer, only a na\u00efve person would ever believe this. It is a process, and you need to \n it.\nUse these barefoot date nights to look at things such as bank fees and superfunds: if you are not paying zero fees and you don\u2019t have a superfund, then you\u2019re doing something wrong.\nBut let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.\nWe already told you, in our summary of \nthat self-discipline and willpower don\u2019t work; what works is automation.\nWell, this step introduces you to Pape\u2019s \u201cServiette Strategy,\u201d his \u201csimple, three-\u2018bucket\u2019 solution where you put your money on autopilot, so you\u2019ll never have to worry about it again.\u201d\nHow does it work?\nJust allocate your income each month in three buckets:\n\u2022 \n, \u201cfor daily expenses, the occasional splurge and some extra cash to fight financial fires;\u201d\n\u2022 \n, \u201cto provide some \u2018safety money\u201d (online savings account with another institution; reserve $2,000 in here on your first Barefoot date night); and\n\u2022 \n, \u201cto build long-term wealth and total security\u201d (9.5% of your wage reserved in an ultra-low-fee superfund).\nAllocate further by using this simple strategy to distribute the money in your Blow Bucket:\n\u2022 \n (10%)\n\u2022 \n (10%)\n\u2022 \n (20%)\nAs for the rest 60%?\nWell, they are (understandably) reserved for daily expenses and define \n, the money necessary for you to run \u201cYou, Inc.\u201d:\n\u2022 housing (rent or home loan*): 30 percent\n\u2022 utilities (power, gas, water, broadband, phones): 5\u201310 percent\n\u2022 transport: 5\u201310 percent\n\u2022 insurance: 5 percent\n\u2022 food: 5\u201310 percent.\nNow, you don\u2019t need Pape to tell you that we\u2019re living in \n: half of the things we own we don\u2019t actually own and could lose every single moment.\nYou don\u2019t need that stress in your life, so it\u2019s time to do away with it.\nTime to domino your debts!\nAnd to do that, there are only five dominos you need to set up right:\nThis, of course, is the first thing to do when dealing with your debts: calculate it in its entirety. \nWhether we\u2019re talking about parking fines or credit cards, car loans or money owed to friends \u2013 write all of it down. \nYou need nothing more but a four-column table: name of debt, total amount, interest rate, monthly minimum.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something very powerful about getting stuff out of your head and down on paper,\u201d notes Pape. \n.\nA bank costs more money to get a new customer than it does to keep an existing one. In other words, banks will do everything they can to \n let you go.\nUse this to renegotiate your credit card rates, threatening to leave the bank in case your demands are not met; of course, it\u2019s crucial that you don\u2019t sound like a terrorist. Nobody likes that kind of customer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for some plastic surgery,\u201d writes Pape. \u201cCut up all your credit cards. Take a photo, and post it on the Barefoot Investor Facebook page. Get ready for an avalanche of \u2018likes.\u2019\u201d It helps to know that someone has your back.\nNow it\u2019s time to detonate your debts. To do so, rearrange the list you made in Step 1 \u2013 from smallest to largest. \nAnd use your Fire Extinguisher \u2013 remember: 20% of your take-home pay and you Blow Bucket \u2013 to \u2018hose down\u2019 your smallest debt.\nThen turn the hose to the next debt, and the next, until they\u2019re all put out.\nOnce again, it may sound silly, but it is not \u2013 after each paid debt, organize a small (or large, depending on the debt) bill-burning ceremony.\n\u201cCelebrating is really, really important,\u201d writes Pape. \u201cYou need to give yourself a pat on the back for having a small win. That\u2019s how you build momentum. You\u2019re training your brain to win.\u201d\nPart 2: Grow\nNow that you\u2019ve planted your wealth tree and domino-ed your debts, it\u2019s time to grow your fortune. Learn how to earn more and save more in three simple steps:\nFirst of all, you need to realize that rent money is not dead money \u2013 well, \u201cat least not in the short term while you get your life and finances in order.\u201d\nIn other words, in case you want to become a wealthy person, it is very important to buy a home and don\u2019t rent; however, it is even more important to not rush into anything.\nMost people, warns Pape, make these five mistakes when buying a home:\n#1. They\u2019re waiting for a crash\n#2. hey buy a home they can\u2019t afford\n#3. They buy an investment property first\n#4. They rent but forget to save\n#5. They don\u2019t consider other options\nIf you haven\u2019t made any of these five mistakes so far, then you\u2019re on a good path: you just need to learn how to save for home deposit properly.\nAccording to Pape, you need 20% of your paycheck to do that.\nThat\u2019s right \u2013 you\u2019ve guessed it: the Fire Extinguisher Bucket.\nIt served you well so far to domino your debts, but now that you don\u2019t have any, it will serve you even better to buy you a home.\nYou can even go overboard: learn how to live off of one salary (it is possible, and it\u2019s short-term), and save your partner\u2019s entire salary for your home for two years. \nIt\u2019s just enough to end up with a home.\nIn Step 2 we told you that 9.5% of your paycheck goes into a grow fund; usually \u2013 and in many countries \u2013 this is paid by your employer; that\u2019s how one gets his pension in most of the world.\nNow, there\u2019s a trick to get an even better deal: after you\u2019re done buying a home, boost this to 15% (i.e., add 5.5% yourself)!\nIf you\u2019ve already read our summary of \n, you already know this part \u2013 that\u2019s where Pape borrows it from.\nBut here\u2019s it again:\nIf you\u2019re 30 and you\u2019re earning about $72,000 a year, 5.5% of your yearly salary amounts to a little more than 330$ a month or just $10 a day.\nWhat does saving $10 a day would mean to you 37 years later when you\u2019ll retire at the age of 67?\nWell, assuming conservatively just 8% growth, and 2% inflation, you\u2019ll be richer for more than half a million dollars!\nAdd to that the amount saved by your employer and, yup, you\u2019ll retire a \nmillionaire ($2,063,179 to be more exact)!\nIf you follow Scott Pape\u2019s first five steps pretty carefully, by Step 6, you\u2019ll be able to basically forget everything around you and start living your life to the fullest!\nBut there\u2019s one more thing you should do before starting to feel the happiest you can ever be: triple the amount in your Mojo Bucket.\nWhat does this mean?\nIt doesn\u2019t mean just putting $6,000 on the side; it means having \u2013 at all times \u2013 three Blow Buckets in your Mojo Bucket; so, if you\u2019re earning $5,000 a month, put $15,000 in your Mojo Bucket after domino-ing your debts, buying a house and increasing your super to 15%.\nWhy?\nBecause that\u2019s what security is; that\u2019s what freedom is; and, according to many studies: that\u2019s what happiness is.\nPart 3: Harvest\n\u201cAsk any farmer what their favorite time of the year is, and they\u2019ll tell you \u2018harvest!\u2019\u201d We don\u2019t need to tell you why; but Pape wants to show you \nto harvest even more.\n\u201cIf your home loan is with a big bank,\u201d notes Pape, \u201cthere\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re getting screwed. Generally speaking, the banks don\u2019t do the best deals on home loans because\u2026 they don\u2019t need to.\u201d\nBut believe it or not, you can wipe off almost 7 years of your mortgage and save over $77,641 by adhering to these three simple rules:\nLet Scott Pape remind you of something: \u201cA home loan is a pretty simple proposition: you borrow money from the bank to buy a home and then pay it back with interest over 25 to 30 years.\u201d Everything else \u2013 repayment holidays, fixing a portion of your loan, etc. \u2013 is where the bank makes its margin.\nYou know why banks are offering fixed-rate deals? Because exit fees are banned and want to stop you from switching to a better deal. Fixed-rate loans give them that power.\nAs we said above, it\u2019s more expensive for banks to find a new customer; six times more expensive to be exact; use this knowledge to get a cheaper rate.\nHow does this work?\nSimple: threaten your bank that you\u2019ll refinance if your bank doesn\u2019t drop its rate; stay firm in your demands, and you\u2019ll probably save $22k on your loan based on a mortgage of $400k over 18 years at 4%.\nWhat if your bank doesn\u2019t agree to your demands?\nWell, ring them again.\nAnd if they don\u2019t agree then as well \u2013 switch.\nAnd start the procedure once again.\nSome will say that you need $1 million saved in order to retire and live happily as long as you do with your partners; others add \u201c$1 million each,\u201d i.e., $2 million in full.\nWhat does Scott Pape say?\nThough the more money, the better: $170k in super for singles or $250k for couples is just enough by the time you retire.\nIf you\u2019ve paid off your debts and your home and you\u2019re getting a pension, then you\u2019ll end up with more than $60,000 yearly from the age of 67 onward.\nYou don\u2019t need more.\nHow do you like to be remembered?\nAs the guy who drove a C-Class Mercedes or the one who gave away some of his/her money to charity or scientific organizations and helped the lives of those around you get better?\nIt\u2019s not even a question, is it?\nAfter all, nobody ever gets remembered for driving a Mercedes.\nIf you manage to build wealth, share some of it\u2013 with those you love and those who need it more than you.\nThat way, you\u2019ll be remembered.\nThe right way.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Barefoot Investor\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Schedule a Monthly Barefoot Date Night with Your Partner \n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Allocate Your Monthly Payments in Three Buckets\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Live Off 60 Percent of Your Income (Aka: The Barefoot Benchmark) \nSchedule a Monthly Barefoot Date Night with Your Partner \nThe first step of retiring wealthy and living a comfortable life (at least money-wise) is only remotely related to money; and it\u2019s the most pleasurable one.\nNamely, setting up a monthly financial date night with your partner; treat yourself, say, the last Friday of every month and use that day to talk finance.\nUse the first few dates to set up a long-term strategy and rules: it\u2019s the two of you against the world, and, more than anything, you want your partner on board when it comes to financial fears and solutions.\nAllocate Your Monthly Payments in Three Buckets\nThe foundation of Scott Pape\u2019s plan: allocating your monthly income in three buckets:\n\u2022 \n, \u201cfor daily expenses, the occasional splurge and some extra cash to fight financial fires;\u201d\n\u2022 \n, \u201cto provide some \u2018safety money\u201d (online savings account with another institution; reserve $2,000 in here on your first Barefoot date night); and\n\u2022 \n, \u201cto build long-term wealth and total security\u201d (9.5% of your wage reserved in an ultra-low-fee superfund).\nLive Off 60 Percent of Your Income (Aka: The Barefoot Benchmark)\nNow, the Blow Bucket is mostly for daily expenses, but the daily expenses should never amount to more than 60% of your income.\nIn Scott Pape\u2019s experience, this should prove to be more than enough for you to deal with housing, utilities, transport, insurance and food.\nThe rest 40% should be divided into three smaller buckets: the Splurge Bucket (10% for short-term pleasures), the Smile Bucket (10% for long-term pleasures), and the Fire Extinguisher (20% for debts and when they are done, home deposits).\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nThe Barefoot Investor Quotes\nFinal Notes\nScott Pape is an Australian, and as far as Australians are concerned, he is \u201cthe most knowledgeable regarding financial matters, topping the ratings in the areas of superannuation, investment, taxation, insurance and economics.\u201d\nAnd that should tell you a lot about the very easy-to-read and even easier-to-follow money manual that is \nIf you are an Australian (because a lot of its advices are geo-based), it is certainly \n.\n\n"},

And Why?\nis a book which everyone who believes that IQ cannot be improved should read; if you don\u2019t believe the studies which say otherwise, you\u2019ll have to believe Hurley, because he didn\u2019t stop at merely reading the articles: he tested them out personally.\nHis findings will certainly interest psychology students and all those people out there who constantly try to hack their brains \u2013 and on a daily basis. \nWell, time to see what science says about your experiments.\nSmarter Summary\nRetaking the Mensa Test\nHave you ever taken an IQ test with Mensa, \u201cthe high IQ society\u201d?\nIf so, you probably already know two things:\n1) You\u2019re in if you score higher than 132;\n2) You can\u2019t retake your test.\nOK \u2013 you understand the first one; but why the second one? Your teachers begged you to take another math or physics test in case you failed the first one! Why is Mensa doing the opposite?\n\u201cMensa does not permit applicants to take its IQ test twice,\u201d says Dan Hurley, \u201cbecause the organization ascribes to the view that intelligence doesn\u2019t change much, so there\u2019s really no point in retaking it. Either you got it or you don\u2019t.\u201d\nAnother question:\nDoesn\u2019t this imply that your intelligence is kind of inscribed in your genes and there\u2019s nothing you can do to change it?\nWell, until as recently as 2008, \u201cthe consensus among mainstream intelligence researchers was that human intelligence is just too complex, and too closely linked to innate characteristics of the brain, to be significantly modified by any straightforward training method.\u201d\nBecause \u201cunlike a test of physical strength, which measures only how you performed today, intelligence tests have always been pitched as an upper limit on what you can ever do: a cognitive glass ceiling, a number tattooed on the soul.\u201d\nAnd then, in May 2008, two Swiss researchers, Susanne Jaeggi and Martin Buschkuehl, published a study in the prominent \n reporting on what happened when college students played a peculiar computerized game called the N-back for twenty minutes a day, five days a week, for four weeks.\nThe title of the study already says a lot:\n\u201c\n.\u201d\nBut to understand its implications, you\u2019ll have to bear with us for 12 minutes.\nIntelligence Matters\nFirst of all, something you should never forget \u2013 especially \n in our just too-PC times: intelligence matters.\nSure,\n, and Angela Duckworth can add that \n is really what separates the best from the rest, but IQ is (and always will be) a factor of utmost importance.\n\u201cCertainly IQ is not everything,\u201d writes Hurley, \u201cperhaps it\u2019s not even the most important thing, but it\u2019s definitely one of them. As we all knew in elementary school and can see in our workplaces and on the front pages of the newspaper every day, intelligence, or smarts, or whatever you want to call it, does matter.\u201d\nAfter all, we are defined by it: the very existence of \nis a proof that intelligence differentiates species; a\n, this means that some humans are most probably different from other humans due to slightly higher intelligence.\nJust think of it this way: based on their high scores on standardized tests, both Sergey Brin and Mark Zuckerberg \u2013 Lady Gaga as well \u2013 were selected to attend the Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins.\nAnd it goes beyond identifying smart people at a very early age!\nFor example, a recent study of 1,116,442 Swedish men whose IQs were tested at age eighteen found that after twenty-two years (i.e., at the age of 40), those who scored in the bottom 25% were over 5 times more likely to have died of poisoning, 3 times more likely to have drowned, and over twice as likely to have been killed in a traffic accident as those who scored in the top 25 percent!\nAnd a host of other studies confirm this.\nThe Highly Unamerican Idea of Eugenics\nNow, we, as Americans, do not want to be told these kinds of things, right?\nAfter all, this country made its name by adhering strictly to the ultrademocratic motto: everyone can be whatever one chooses to be.\nThe very idea of your IQ being inscribed in your genes goes so much against this dictum that one would not be blamed for reasoning that it\u2019s preposterous to even think something like \u201cintelligence is heritable\u201d and/or \u201cintelligence cannot be changed\u201d this side of the Atlantic.\nAnd yet, it was in the United States that the pseudoscience of eugenics had its birthplace!\nChampioned by the likes of Margaret Sanger, J. H. Kellogg, and Alexander Graham Bell, the idea that the unintelligent will forever remain to be that way resulted in over 60,000 forced sterilizations in the US, going all the way into the 1960s!\nIn fact, for a time, it was even sanctioned by the U.S. Supreme Court and funded by some of the most philanthropic organizations of all times: the Carnegie Institution and the \n.\nWant to hear the worst part?\nThe eugenics movement in the US \u201cwas credited by Nazi leaders, including Adolf Hitler himself, as inspiring their \u2018war on the weak.\u2019\u201d\nIf you think that\u2019s a thing of the past, think again: your President, just like \n, base their worldviews upon this kind of reasoning, still believing, for example, that illegal Hispanic immigrants to America have lower IQs than non-Hispanic whites.\nFluid and Crystallized Intelligence\nNow, back to our May 2008 study.\nYou got the gist of that title: intelligence \n be improved. \nHowever, you may have had some problems understanding the meaning of that word \u201cfluid\u201d before the word \u201cintelligence.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, that\u2019s the keyword.\nYou see, back in 1971, the British-American psychologist Raymond Cattell first theorized the existence of two different types of general intelligence: fluid and crystallized intelligence.\nCrystallized intelligence is your \u201ctreasure trove of stored-up information and how-to knowledge, which just keeps growing as you age \u2013 the sort of thing tested on \n or put to use when you ride a bicycle.\u201d\nFluid intelligence, on the other hand, is \u201cthe underlying ability to learn, the capacity to solve novel problems, see underlying patterns, and figure out things that were never explicitly taught.\u201d\nAnd unlike crystallized intelligence, fluid intelligence peaks in early adulthood and then gradually declines.\nThis is the reason why most mathematicians, physicists, musicians and chess players are best in their 20s and 30s; afterward, they are unable to solve novel problems, so the quality of their work declines.\nAnother problem with fluid intelligence: based on everything we knew for half a century (and even the whole century before that), it was \u201cimpervious to the effects of training.\u201d\nWe now know better.\nMeasuring Fluid Intelligence\nNo matter what most people say nowadays, standard IQ tests are not a bad indicator of someone\u2019s intelligence; after all, we do know that if you score below a certain number on those tests, then you\u2019ll probably receive Social Security income.\nHowever, we \n know \u2013 at least now \u2013 that standard IQ tests are not perfect; and that no matter how good they are, they can\u2019t be, by definition, objective.\nHowever, though intuitively quite graspable, intelligence \u2013 just like some other important things (love, truth, time) \u2013 is scientifically wholly inscrutable.\nWhere is it located? How does it work? How is it related to memory?\nThe bad news: we\u2019re still far from finding the exact answers to these questions; the good news: we\u2019re getting there.\nHow?\nBy scanning the brain, of course.\nEven though numerous studies had discovered that the size of the brain does matter when it came to intelligence even before the last decade, none of them had shown the actual extent.\nThat is, until recently.\nNow, fMRI scans have discovered an almost exact number: about 6.7% of a person\u2019s fluid intelligence can be explained by the overall volume of neurons in his/her \u201cgray matter.\u201d In other words, the bigger your brain, the smarter you are.\nAnd it goes beyond the gray matter: an addition 5% of the fluid intelligence can be explained by the size of a particular region of the brain \u2013 the left lateral prefrontal cortex.\nIn case you don\u2019t know what that is, it is a section located behind the upper-left edge of your hairline.\nWell, fMRI scans have shown that this part of your brain becomes highly active during tests of working memory.\nNow, if your working memory is connected to a part of your brain which is connected, in turn, to your fluid intelligence \u2013 that\u2019s right!\nThe N-Back Game\nLet us remind you of the title of that field-defining study we mentioned in our first section: \u201cImproving Fluid Intelligence with Training on Working Memory.\u201d\nNow it doesn\u2019t seem that incomprehensible, does it?\nWell, time to explain how Susanne Jaeggi and Martin Buschkuehl proved this.\nAs we mentioned above, they did so, using a peculiar game called N-back. After four weeks of tests, students who played the game for 20 minutes a day 5 days a week increased their intelligence by almost 40%!\nIf you don\u2019t believe the hype, ask the author of this book himself: for the purposes of his book, he went through the same kind of training (coupled with some things explained below), and, by the end of it, his intelligence scores climbed 16.4 percent.\nIn other words, his fluid intelligence \n improved.\nWhat\u2019s this game we\u2019re talking about, you ask?\nWell, nothing particularly fancy.\nThe N-back game consists of guessing how far back a particular letter appeared in a sequence. In other words, if you\u2019re playing the 1-back game, you\u2019re asked to press a keyboard key when you notice that a letter has just appeared.\nFor example, in the sequence \u201cA B C B \n A,\u201d the only time you\u2019ll have to press a keyboard key after the fourth (here bolded) letter. \nIn the 2-back game, the same rules apply, only in this case, you\u2019ll have to remember up to two places back, i.e., in the sequence above, you\u2019ll have to press the keyboard key after the third letter (\u201cA B C \n B A\u201d).\nThere\u2019s also a dual N-back game (where you follow both audio and visual signals), and you can \n.\nDo play it \u2013 because it makes you \n smarter.\nOther Ways to Increase Your Intelligence\nPlaying computer games (\n) is not the only way to increase your fluid intelligence.\nAnd we know this at least since the 1960s when one study demonstrated that older people who regularly play tennis are consistently better at cognitive tests than those who didn\u2019t.\nWith this in mind, Teresa Liu-Ambrose \u2013 \u201ca spritely forty-year-old jogger, dog lover, and mother of three who holds an impressive list of academic credentials\u201d \u2013 randomly divided 86 women into three groups.\nEach of these was supposed to train something for six months: one group toning, the other aerobic and the last one resistance.\nAt the end of the study, this last group showed significant improvements in traditional cognitive tests; even better: fMRI scans discovered increased activity in the areas connected to fluid intelligence.\nResistance training, it is then!\nAdd to that something more enjoyable: music lessons.\nGlenn Schellenberg, a psychologist who doesn\u2019t really believe in the Mozart effect, has shown that whether it is voice lessons, keyboard lessons or acting lessons \u2013 they all improve fluid intelligence.\nVoice lessons in particular; keyboard lessons follow; and even acting lessons are better than no lessons at all.\nIn other words, your brain is an organ and is worse off when not used; if used correctly, it can improve your chances at success in life.\nDemonstrated by many studies of the last decade.\nTested by Dan Hurley.\nAnd \u2013 get this! \u2013 approved by the US military which, in 2006, founded the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) whose mission is explicitly stated thus: \u201cto envision and lead high-risk, high-payoff research that delivers innovative technology for future overwhelming intelligence advantage.\u201d\nStill skeptical?\nKey Lessons from \u201cSmarter\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There Are Two Types of Intelligence \u2013 and Only One of Them Gets Better with Age\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There\u2019s a Good Chance That Some Computer Games Might Make You Smarter\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Never Mind the Scores: Intelligence Is Tested by Life\nThere Are Two Types of Intelligence \u2013 and Only One of Them Gets Better with Age\nThe reason why Mensa doesn\u2019t allow people to retake their tests is simple: they believe that intelligence doesn\u2019t change much throughout life.\nThe truth is \u2013 a part of it most certainly does. \nIt is called crystallized intelligence, and it is the \u201ctreasure trove of stored-up information and how-to knowledge\u201d in your brain. As expected, on average, older people know more than young ones \u2013 and this is due to their crystallized intelligence.\nHowever, young people are far more creative and capable of solving novel problems. This is due to another part of the general intelligence, called fluid intelligence. \nNow, unfortunately, fluid intelligence declines with age; and this is that part of your intelligence that Mensa believes is unchangeable.\nNew studies, however, show that it is.\nThere\u2019s a Good Chance That Some Computer Games Make You Smarter\nAccording to a field-defining 2008 study by two Swiss scientists, the so-called N-back game (which you can play for free online) improves one\u2019s fluid intelligence.\nAnd this is true even if merely played for 20 minutes, 5 days a week, over a 4-week period.\nWhat are you waiting for?\nHere\u2019s one game you can convince your parents that is \n for your sake.\nNever Mind the Scores: Intelligence Is Tested by Life\nComputer games are not the only thing proven to improve intelligence; resistance training and music lessons have pretty much the same effect as well.\nUsing a combination of science-backed exercises for intelligence improvement, the author of \nDan Hurley, did indeed become smarter by 16.4%.\n\u201cAnd so what?\u201d \u2013 he writes in the last chapter of his book. \u201cThose are just numbers on a test. In the end, for all of us, the best test of cognitive abilities is one for which there is no answer key. It\u2019s called life.\u201d\nAnd he offers a great example of what he means by this:\n\u201cFrom 1986 to 1989, Marilyn Vos Savant was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as having the highest recorded IQ in the world for women, at 190. Since then, what has she done? She has been writing \n magazine\u2019s \u2018Ask Marilyn\u2019 advice column.

The Starving Artist believes you must be born an artist. The Thriving Artist knows you must become one.\n#2. The Starving Artist strives to be original. The Thriving Artist steals from his influences.\n#3. The Starving Artist believes he has enough talent. The Thriving Artist apprentices under a master.\n#4. The Starving Artist is stubborn about everything. The Thriving Artist is stubborn about the right things.\n#5. The Starving Artist waits to be noticed. The Thriving Artist cultivates patrons.\n#6. The Starving Artist believes he can be creative anywhere. The Thriving Artist goes where creative work is already happening.\n#7. The Starving Artist always works alone.

The Thriving Artist makes money to make art.\nLet\u2019s look at them one by one!\nPart 1: Mind-Set\n\u201cWe first approach our art not with our hands but with our minds,\u201d writes Goins in the short introduction to the first part of \n.\nAnd he goes on to explain some more:\nWe all develop thought patterns and limiting beliefs that prohibit us from being where we want to be in life, and creative work is no exception. Here, we attack those obstacles head-on, adopting new ways of thinking, so that we can stop starving and start creating. We must master our mind-set.\u201d\n\u201cArtists are born, not made.\u201d\nThis adage is as old as (at least) the Roman Empire.\nThe only problem?\nIt is not true.\nIn reality, everyone can become an artist: writing, painting, music \u2013 they are all skills (like many others) that can be acquired.\nTake \n, for example.\nAs you know full well, he is a lawyer by trade and a writer by choice; interestingly enough, it was the latter that made him a household name and a millionaire.\nGrisham started his career by spending just an hour daily to write about one page of his first book. Three years later, that book became his first novel (\n), so unattractive that 40 publishers passed on it before it finally reached the shelves in a modest print run of 5,000 copies.\nGrisham didn\u2019t give up and wrote another novel.\nPerhaps you\u2019ve heard of it: \n.\nSuddenly, Grisham became the talk of the town and, after \nbecame a successful Hollywood movie starring Tom Cruise soon after, the sky became the limit.\nThe interesting paradox?\nA man who wasn\u2019t a writer by profession invented the most popular genre of the modern age: the legal thriller.\nPerhaps it has to do something with Grisham\u2019s ability \n?\nCan you?\nThat\u2019s your road to greatness.\n(And, let\u2019s not forget, wealth.)\n\u201cImmature poets imitate; mature poets steal\u201d \u2013 wrote T. S. Eliot in 1920.\nAnd more than two decades before him, another guy, W. H. Davenport Adams, praised Alfred Tennyson for his \u201cassimilative method, when he adopts an image or a suggestion from a predecessor, and works it up into his own glittering fabric.\u201d\nHe recapped the technique in \u201ca modest canon:\u201d \u201cgreat poets imitate and improve, whereas small ones steal and spoil.\u201d\nYou might have heard this adage in another version (\n) \u2013 \u201cGood artists copy. Great artists steal\u201d \u2013 but what matters most is its essence.\nAnd that is: originality doesn\u2019t exist; the most original artists merely improve upon older visions and designs.\n\u201cTo be ignorant of what occurred before you were born,\u201d wrote Cicero once, \u201cis to remain always a child.\u201d\nSo, don\u2019t be one!\nLearn everything there is to know and \nit.\nPostmodernism is nothing more but a critically approved theft.\nBefore Michelangelo became Michelangelo, he was nothing more but a humble student of a famous Florentine artist now mainly known as his teacher, a certain Domenico Ghirlandaio.\nInterestingly enough, that\u2019s how most great art careers begin: with an apprenticeship.\n\u201cBefore we become masters,\u201d writes Goins, \u201cwe must first become apprentices.\u201d\nAnd even later on, it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask for a piece of advice or two (see advices 6 and 7).\nAs Atul Gawande says: \nHowever, most artists aren\u2019t humble.\nIn fact, they are quite the opposite of that: stubborn and resilient in their vision of the world.\nThat\u2019s the other part of your mind that you need cultivating if you want to become a master: when the time is right, end your apprenticeship and try to sever the links to the old order.\nAnd, more importantly, persist in your vision.\nIf Grisham\u2019s first novel was rejected by 40 publishers, Fitzgerald\u2019s \nwas by no less than 122! And \n?\nYou know why Grisham, Fitzgerald and Rowling succeeded?\nBecause they were (as Jeff Bezos) says \u201cstubborn on vision,\u201d and \u201cflexible on details.\u201d\nStarving artists are flexible on the details as well.\nThriving ones know better.\nPart 2: Market\nOnce you master your mindset, it\u2019s time to tackle the market, \u201cthe place where we become professionals and learn how this works in the real world.\u201d\nIf we do it well, says Jeff Goins, people will not just pay attention, but they will also pay you.\nIf you\u2019ve ever read the original Charles Perrault\u2019s version of Cinderella, then you already know that in addition to the shallow Disney message that inner beauty and graciousness beats physical good looks, there\u2019s also another more, interesting one:\n\u201cWithout doubt, it is a great advantage to have intelligence, courage, good breeding, and common sense. These, and similar talents come only from heaven, and it is good to have them. However, even these may fail to bring you success, without the blessing of a godfather or a godmother.\u201d\nHa? You didn\u2019t expect that, did you?\nLike it or not, that\u2019s how the real world works!\nWe all like and love figures such as, say, Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash but there\u2019s no way we would have known them if it wasn\u2019t for a guy named Sam Phillips, an American record producer.\nIf it wasn\u2019t for him, quipped once Cash, \u201cI might still be working in a cotton field.\u201d\nElvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis \u2013 they would probably say something similar.\nThe lesson?\nDon\u2019t wait to be noticed. Cultivate patrons who can nurture your noticeability.\nWe\u2019ve already told you more than once that a thorn between roses smells lovely, but a rose between thorns withers away.\nWell, that\u2019s the essence of Jeff Goins\u2019 next lesson: you cannot be creative anywhere, but only where creative work is already happening.\nThe first asks for tremendous amounts of discipline and willpower; the latter turns them into an everyday ritual.\nAs we have already told you in our summary of \n, genius is not born in isolation and, moreover, genius breeds genius.\nWhy?\nBecause, wherever there\u2019s a cluster of creative individuals, there\u2019s also an abundance of profound and meaningful discussion. \u00a0\nWhether it\u2019s Ancient Athens we\u2019re talking about or pre-war Vienna, whether it\u2019s between-the-wars Paris or the Silicon Valley in question, what spurs the creative mind on is always the scene.\n \u201cThe most important factor in the success of your career,\u201d Jeff Goins was told by Richard Florida, a college professor, \u201cis where you decide to live.\u201d\nBerlin, maybe?\nLet us guess:\nYou\u2019re the new Shakespeare, the new Michelangelo, the great, lone genius whose vision can\u2019t be understood by anyone on this planet?\nAnd all those Beyonc\u00e9s of the world are mere beautiful faces who are considered musical geniuses even though they have more than 15 writers on \nsong only?\nRight?\nWell, wrong, very wrong.\nMost of the great artists in history collaborated with one or two other artists at least once in their lives; and many others have done it much more and with many more people.\nBoth Shakespeare and Michelangelo are often considered incomparable in their skill and intellectual capacities to their contemporaries, but, for some reason, these two guys didn\u2019t share the opinion.\nOn the contrary: both collaborated with their friends when their projects demanded that.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t do our best work alone,\u201d writes Goins. And that is because \u201ccreativity is not a solitary invention but a collaborative creation.\u201d\nMyth #8: geniuses create in solitude and share their work with the world only after they\u2019re finished.\nFact #8: great creative minds throughout history have practiced in public and perfected their work through sharing and feedbacks.\nIn fact, not \n your work is one of the worst things you can do (both for yourself and the ones that come after you), and, according to none other by Edgar Allan Poe himself, we owe the myth of the enlightened artist to a little something called \u201cauthorial vanity.\u201d\n\u201cI have often thought how interesting a magazine paper might be written by any author who would \u2013 that is to say, who could \u2013 detail, step by step, the processes by which any one of his compositions attained its ultimate point of completion,\u201d \n wrote in his \u201cPhilosophy of Composition.\u201d \nAnd now we have a way to do that.\nIt\u2019s called blogging and it\u2019s not just a peek into the creative process.\nIt is the Creative Process itself.\nPart 3: Money\n\u201cIf we are going to thrive as artists,\u201d writes Jeff Goins, \u201cwe cannot merely survive. We have to make a living off our creations, which means at some point we need to talk about the part we\u2019re all uncomfortable discussing: money.\u201d\nOf course, the Starving Artist avoids this topic as a Christian avoids the Devil, but the Thriving Artist knows that business is part of art and even money is something an artist must master.\nHere\u2019s how.\nUnfortunately, many artists consider the pleasure they get from creating something enough \u2013 it isn\u2019t work if you don\u2019t break at least a drop of sweat, is it?\nOr is that so?\n\u201cWhen bankers get together for dinner, they discuss Art,\u201d wrote once Oscar Wilde ironically. \u201cWhen artists get together for dinner, they discuss Money.\u201d\nOnly, just like the creative process, this is kept hidden from the public.\nIt is a fact of life that you need money, because, well, everybody needs money. And it is an even surer fact of life that if you work for free, you won\u2019t get any money.\nSo, stop doing that.\nStart valuing your work the way Michelangelo did.\nThe money will come itself.\nThis is very important.\nWe live in a capitalist world and everyone wants to make the maximum profit possible with minimum effort.\nIn other words, nobody is really interested in giving you money just like that.\nThis is why there are such things as an internship (aka free work) and also the reason why there are such things as \u201clifetime rights\u201d or \u201cghostwriters.\u201d\nStay away from these.\nOwn your work \u2013 you never know how much money it could bring you in the future.\nJust imagine how much money would Jim Hanson had lost if he had agreed to sell the rights to his Rowlf the Dog puppet when he was offered $10,000 for them by the Purina dog company!\nHanson, fortunately, didn\u2019t agree to such a deal and went on to create the Muppets, which, of course, brought him many times that amount.\n\u201cJack of all trades, master of none\u201d \u2013 an old saying which describes our current attitude towards \n.\nIn plain words: if you dabble in more crafts than one, then you\u2019re probably bad at all of them.\nHowever, as \n and \n noted a long time ago, this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth and is a product of the system we\u2019re living in \u2013 not the nature of a human being.\nAfter all, how did Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo Galilei and \n managed to excel at so many things?\n\u201cA man can do all things if he will,\u201d wrote Leon Battista Alberti in the 15\n century.\nHe was right.\nIt\u2019s a new age, and you need to master more crafts than one if you want to have more chances to succeed. \nAlso: your mind likes adventures.\nSo you\u2019ll be happier as well.\nWe mentioned Marx above \u2013 time to quote him now:\n\u201cThe writer must earn money in order to be able to live and to write, but he must by no means live and write for the purpose of making money.\u201d\nWhat does that mean if slipped out of its wording and syntax?\nSimply put:\nYou must make money to make art; nothing more, and nothing less.\n: \u201cMoney exists, in my world, to buy me another season.\u201d\n\u201cEvery season you create instead of scramble to find work is a win,\u201d adds Jeff Goins, \u201cand with time, those seasons add up. The more money you have, the more time you have; and the more time you have, the more art you can make.\u201d\nIt\u2019s that simple.\nConclusion: Join the New Renaissance\nIf you were an artist in the Renaissance, concludes Goins, you\u2019d probably laugh away the idea of the starving artist specialized in one genre.\nYou\u2019d almost certainly believe in the opposite: that you are both capable of and expected to master few crafts, that you have to do that under an old master for the first part of your life, and that there\u2019s nothing wrong in collaborating, practicing in public or earning money for your work. \nWell, Goins notes, after the period of wide-eyed Romanticism, there is a new renaissance that is turning starving artists into thriving artists and it is your job to embrace it.\nBecause now you have a choice:\n\u201cYou can go the way of the tired, frustrated artist who struggles to keep creating. Or you can embrace an important but challenging truth that just might set you free from such thinking. You don\u2019t have to starve. You can thrive. The world is waiting for you to create your best work. Please don\u2019t let us down.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cReal Artists Don\u2019t Starve\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Artists Are Not Born \u2013 They Are Made\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If You Are an Artist, Then the Market Is Your Friend\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Make Money to Make Art \u2013 Not the Other Way Around\nArtists Are Not Born \u2013 They Are Made\nEven though many would beg to differ, there are numerous cases of people who became artists the way one becomes pretty much everything else: through years of study.\nIn fact, the very word \u201cart\u201d means \u201cskill,\u201d and in Ancient Greece, poetry, for example, belonged to the same category of creative endeavors as, say, carpentry.\nAnd if you want to learn to become an artist, learn it the way most artists have: under an old master.\nIf You Are an Artist, Then the Market Is Your Friend\nEven though it is usually believed that only minor and sold-out artists can be successful, historically, it has often been the other way around: Michelangelo, for example, boasted a fortune which equals to at least $30 million in current money (some say even twice that).\nAnd it\u2019s not only that: being out on the market is beneficial to the creative process itself. Cultivating patrons, joining a vibrant, creative scene, collaborating with others and practicing in public \u2013 these are all great strategies on how to both become a better artist and start earning money from your art.\nMake Money to Make Art \u2013 Not the Other Way Around\nNow, don\u2019t get Jeff Goins wrong: he doesn\u2019t say that you should start creating the things the public wants and earn some easy money on the side.\nNo \u2013 he still thinks that art is a noble profession. However, he adds that money doesn\u2019t spoil it; in fact, it makes it possible.\nIt is pointless to make art in order to make money (that is probably not art, anyway); however, it makes a lot of sense to make money so as to make \nart.\nOtherwise, how would you?\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nReal Artists Don\u2019t Starve Quotes\nFinal Notes\noffers a down-to-earth look at one of the most mystical human endeavors: the creative act.\nBrimming with inspiring stories and amusing anecdotes \u2013 not to mention enlightening quotes \u2013 the book is a great guide for artists who want to earn money, and an even better one for those who erroneously believe in the story of the starving artist.\nSpoiler alert: it is a myth."},

And Why?\nSome people live longer than others; Dan Buettner has spent more than a decade of his life finding why by exploring the regions with most centenarians personally, by interviewing these centenarians more than once, over a long period of time.\nThe result is \n, a book you must read if you want to live a longer life, and, even more importantly, a life worthy enough to be lengthened.\nThe Blue Zones Summary\nThe Book at a Glance\nIn November 2005, Dan Buettner \u2013 then an internationally recognized researcher and explorer, now a \n best-selling author as well \u2013 wrote a cover story for \ntitled \u201cThe Secrets of a Long Life.\u201d\nIn it, for the first time in history, he used the phrase \u201cblue zones\u201d to refer to regions of the world where people live longer than average.\nThree years later, the article evolved in a book \u2013 \n \u2013 which in 2012 was revised and updated for a second edition, this one more specifically subtitled: \nA few other related books and articles have appeared in the meantime, culminating in the Blue Zones Project, Dan Buettner\u2019s attempt to apply his Blue Zones principles to actual communities and towns around the world (mostly in the US).\nThese principles are listed in the seventh (originally sixth) and last chapter of \n,\nDan Buettner\u2019s most celebrated and popular book.\nBuettner describes this chapter (titled \u201cYour Personal Blue Zone\u201d) as \u201ca cross-cultural distillation of the world\u2019s best practices in longevity\u201d, \u201ca de facto formula for longevity\u2014the best, most credible information available for adding years to your life and life to your years.\u201d\nAnd since the other five chapters are on-field reports of the original five Blue Zones which cover pretty much the same things but with emphasis on the places and people rather than on the action advices, we felt that the best and most useful way to summarize this book is to run through its sixth chapter, i.e., to share with you Dan Buettner\u2019s nine lessons for living longer.\nBut, before that \u2013 let\u2019s just take a quick look at the places.\nThe Original Blue Zones\nA Blue Zone, as we said above, is a place where people live longer than average. \nThe first edition of Dan Buettner\u2019s \ndiscussed four such regions, and the second one added a fifth.\nThese are the places, \u201cthe world\u2019s confirmed longevity hotspots,\u201d the original Blue Zones themselves:\n, particularly the Barbagia region;\n The islands of \n;\n The Seventh-day Adventist community of \n;\n \n; and\nThe island of \n (not included in the first edition).\nAfter an introductory chapter, each of the following five chapters delves deep in these cultures, trying to extract the secrets of longevity; and everywhere Buettner encounters a different culture that has taken its own unique path to long life. \nHe also shows how \u201chistory, genes, and time-honored traditions conspire to favor each population;\u201d and he tries to find scientific explanations why these people live longer (and better) than most of us.\nThe Nine Lessons for Living Longer\n\u201cIf you live the average American lifestyle,\u201d writes Dan Buettner at the beginning of the most important chapter of \n \n,\n\u201cyou may never reach your potential maximum lifespan. You might even fall short by as much as a decade.\u201d\nAnd then he asks a rhetorical question: \u201cBut what if you could follow a simple program that could help you feel younger, lose weight, maximize your mental sharpness, and keep your body working as long as possible? Indeed, what if you could get back that extra decade of healthy life that you may unknowingly be squandering?\u201d\nOf course, Buettner doesn\u2019t stop there, and he goes on to present the \u201cPower Nine,\u201d \u201cthe world\u2019s best practices in health and longevity,\u201d all distilled from his experiences with the centenarians of the Blue Zones.\nThe best part: they are all not merely described, but also paired with relevant strategies to apply them in your life.\nOr: \n\u201cLongevity all-stars don\u2019t run marathons or compete in triathlons,\u201d writes Dan Buettner. \u201cInstead, they engage in regular, low-intensity physical activity, often as part of a daily work routine.\u201d\nIn Sardinia, most of the people spend their lives working as shepherds, a profession which involves miles of hiking on a daily basis; in Okinawa, the centenarians garden for hours every single day; and the Adventists in USA\u2019s only Blue Zone take nature walks.\nNow, it\u2019s your turn to follow them thus:\n: get rid of your remote control and use the bicycle as often as possible;\n. Don\u2019t force yourself to go to the gym, but do take a walking break instead of a coffee break at work;\n. Find a friend whose company you enjoy and arrange the first of thousands of walking dates.\n. Be an Okinawan.\n. Don\u2019t say we haven\u2019t told you this before!\nOr: \n\u201cHara Hachi Bu\u201d is a Confucian-inspired adage which all Okinawans say before eating. It means \u201cEat until you are 80 percent full.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a reason for that: as the Okinawans know, it takes some time before the stomach tells the brain how full it is, so eating 80 percent is just enough. \nThat is why the average daily intake of Okinawans is only about 1,900 calories.\nTry it yourself:\n, aka stop eating when you\u2019re 80% full;\nDrink two smoothies, and you\u2019ll probably eat less for lunch later while feeling even fuller.\nThe smaller the vessels, the less you\u2019ll eat (science says so).\n \n Avoid tempting foods. Put candy bowls, cookie jars, and other temptations out of sight.\nPut the scale in your way.\nEating faster results in eating more.\nDon\u2019t watch TV while eating.\nAlso, don\u2019t eat on the run: eat purposefully.\nInterestingly enough,\nin the Blue Zones, \u201cthe biggest meal of the day is typically eaten during the first half of the day. Nicoyans, Okinawans, and Sardinians eat their biggest meal at midday, while Adventists consume many of their calories for breakfast.\u201d\nOr: \nIn Genesis 1:29, God says to Adam and Eve: \u201cBehold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; it shall be food for you.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, the Adventists of Loma Linda, California, take this seriously and avoid meat altogether. Most centenarians of Sardinia, Okinawa and Nicoya have done that as well for most of their lives, primarily because they often didn\u2019t have any access to meat to start with.\nDurum wheat (Sardinia), sweet potato (Okinawa), and maize (Nicoya) did the trick for them.\nIt can work for you as well:\nNo portion of meat larger than a deck of cards \u2013 and only twice a week.\nHide the M&Ms but showcase the fruit.\n. \u201cBeans are a cornerstone of each of the Blue Zone diets,\u201d writes Buettner. \u201cMake beans \u2013 or tofu \u2013 the centerpiece of lunches and dinners.\u201d\n.\n. So as to switch from snacks to nuts, the best way is to always have some nuts around.\nOr: \nEmphasis on the parenthesis above: consistency and moderation (\n already) are key. A glass of red wine or sake with friends or with each meal \u2013 no more than one a day \u2013 is more than \u201cnot bad;\u201d it\u2019s actually \nfor both your health and longevity.\n For example, the Sardinians drink Cannonau in their Blue Zone. \n \u201cSet up yours to include a glass of wine, nuts as an appetizer, and a gathering of friends or time with a spouse.\u201d\n A serving or two per day is the most you\u2019re allowed to; everything more is detrimental to your health.\nOr: \nSome seventy years ago, in the midst of the darkest stage of recent history (the Holocaust), Viktor Frankl discovered that \n makes life worthwhile.\nOkinawans seem to have known this since time immemorial \u2013 they call it \n which, loosely translated corresponds to the French \u201craison d\u2019etre,\u201d a reason for being.\nLiterally, \n can be translated as \u201cthe thing that you live for\u201d and bears pretty much the same connotations as the Nicoyans \n, a life plan.\nBuettner translates both more precisely with a very profound phrase: \u201cwhy I wake up in the morning.\u201d\nWithout an answer to that question, there\u2019s a chance that you\u2019ll spend at least ten years fewer on this planet that the Blue Zones inhabitants.\nHere\u2019s what you can do to change that:\n. It is not only for a CV: answer the question \u201cWhy do you get up in the morning?\u201d so that you get up with a purpose every day.\n \n.\nHumans are social animals, and a purpose \n communicated with someone is a purpose barely existent.\n. Taking up a musical instrument or learning a new language is the best way to preserve your mental sharpness.\nOr: \nThey don\u2019t call it the silent killer for no reason: stress is everything you don\u2019t need in your life.\n\u201cPeople who\u2019ve made it to 100 seem to exude a sense of sublime serenity,\u201d writes Dan Buettner. \u201cPart of it is that their bodies naturally slow down as they have aged, but they\u2019re also wise enough to know that many of life\u2019s most precious moments pass us by if we\u2019re lurching blindly toward some goal.\u201d\nMeditation, mindfulness, yoga \u2013 do what you can but whatever you do, \n as soon as you can: tortoises live longer than you for a reason.\nHere\u2019s Buettner\u2019s (and the Blue Zones\u2019) \n:\n. Television, podcasts, the Internet \u2013 we know they take up a big portion of your time; apparently, you should read that sentence literally, because minimizing time spent with them lengthens life twofold.\n. Plan to arrive 15 minutes early wherever you go. This minimizes stress and allows you to slow down.\n. At least 10 minutes a day \u2013 and, if possible, even 30. \n.\nOr: \nCentenarians in the Blue Zones seem to share another thing between them: faith. \nThey believe in many different things, and they do so in many different manners; and, apparently, it doesn\u2019t even matter if you are Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, or Hindu; what does matter is that you believe and belong to a strong religious community.\n\u201cThe simple act of worship,\u201d writes Buettner, \u201cis one of those subtly powerful habits that seems to improve your chances of having more good years.\u201d\nHere are three strategies on how to achieve this:\n. Take a more active role in the organization you are already a member of.\n. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a particular religious faith,\u201d writes Buettner, \u201ccommit to trying a new faith community.\u201d It doesn\u2019t even have to do a lot with god: Unitarian Universalism, for example, is a liberal religion which is characterized as a \u201cfree and responsible search for truth and meaning.\u201d\n. Whatever you choose, however, don\u2019t be a believer in the solitude of your thoughts; just go to religious services and do so with an open mind.\nOr: \n\u201cThe most successful centenarians we met in the Blue Zones,\u201d informs Dan Buettner, \u201cput their families first. They tended to marry, have children, and build their lives around that core. Their lives were imbued with familial duty, ritual, and a certain emphasis on togetherness.\u201d\nAnd these four tips can help you create your family\u2019s Blue Zone:\n. \n a family is not the same as \n a family; create an environment of togetherness within a smaller house.\n. One family meal a day and one family vacation a year is the minimum.\n. Choose at least one day a year during which you\u2019ll project photographs of your family on the wall and discuss them with your loved ones.\n.

And Why?\nis for everyone who thinks that he/she doesn\u2019t earn enough money to retire at a younger age and for everyone who thinks that the only way to save money is to \nbuy a house until you have some.\nIt\u2019s the perfect book for young people: if you\u2019re 20, \ncan teach you how to retire as a millionaire with a house at 55.\nThe Automatic Millionaire Summary\nThe Book at a Glance\nIf the title isn\u2019t already a giveaway to you, \nis a practical guide to getting rich (and retiring early). \nHowever, unlike other similar manuals, this one boasts a very unique philosophy, one that can be described in seven points, the first three of which startle at first glance:\n#1. You don\u2019t have to make a lot of money to be rich.\n#2. You don\u2019t need discipline.\n#3. You don\u2019t need to be \u201cyour own boss.\u201d\nThen, what do you need?\n#4. Above all, you need an \u201cautomatic system\u201d so you can\u2019t fail.\n#5. By using what the author terms as \u201cThe Latte Factor,\u201d you can supposedly build a fortune on a few dollars a day.\nWhy?\nBecause, \n and \n:\n#6. Homeowners get rich; renters get poor. (Yes, this is still true.)\n#7. The rich get rich (and stay that way) because they pay themselves first.\nBut let\u2019s delve into David Bach\u2019s philosophy a little more.\nChapter One: Meeting the Automatic Millionaire\nTo start with \u2013 it\u2019s not exactly his: as he informs us in the first chapter of his book, the original automatic millionaires are Jim and Sue McIntyre.\nThe author met them when they came to him looking for financial advice; it ended up being the other way around.\nYou see, Jim and Sue McIntyre were in their early fifties when the meeting occurred, and they were readying themselves for retirement.\nWait\u2026 \n?\nYou haven\u2019t heard the strangest part yet: Jim had never earned more than $40,000 a year!\nThen how did he have $2 million on his bank account at 52?\nWell, between working for their money and letting their money work for them, the McIntyres chose the latter.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Jim said to David, \u201cmost people think that when they get their paycheck, the first thing they should do is pay all their bills \u2013 and then if there is anything left over, they can save a few dollars.\u201d\n\u201cIn other words, pay everyone else first and yourself last. Our parents taught us that to really get ahead of the game, you have to turn this around. Put aside a few dollars for yourself, THEN pay all your other bills.\u201d\nOriginally, they started putting aside just 4 percent of their income, and they slowly raised the bar; at the time of the meeting, they were saving 15 percent.\nAlso, because they knew full well that homeowners are rich and renters poor, their first job was to buy a house; and to make a down payment, they gave up smoking and automatically repurposed the money for a home.\n\u201cAutomatic\u201d is the keyword here: to stay away from budgeting arguments (and put discipline out of the picture), the McIntyres set up a system which automatically distributed the funds.\nStill confused?\nRead ahead!\nChapter Two: The Latte Factor: Becoming an Automatic Millionaire on Just a Few Dollars a Day\nThe main lesson David Bach learned from the McIntyres is quite simple: \u201cHow much you earn has almost no bearing on whether or not you can and will build wealth.\u201d\nWhy?\nBecause, more often than not, the more we earn, the more we spend.\nIs there any way out?\nOf course there is!\nThe author calls it the Latte Factor.\nEven though by now it is already \u201can internationally recognized metaphor for how we dribble away what should be our fortunes on small things without ever really giving it much thought\u201d \u2013 it makes sense to explain it here one more time.\nThink of it this way: your average coffee shop latte costs about $3.5 which is, of course, nothing, but which, if considered as a daily cost, amounts to about $1,250 a year. If you are, like the McIntyres, a smoker as well \u2013 on average, $7 per day \u2013 that\u2019s another $2,500 out of the yearly budget.\nNow, over the past fifty years, the average prices on the stock market have gone by around 10 percent on a yearly basis.\nLet\u2019s say that instead of buying a Latte and a pack of cigarettes each day, you put those $10 aside and you invest them; at an annual return of 10%, that would result in more than $1 million dollars after 30 years!\nIn other words, your Lattes and your cigarettes are costing you an indescribably fabulous fortune!\nChapter Three: Learn to Pay Yourself First\nDavid Bach has crunched the actual numbers and you know that math doesn\u2019t lie: if you start saving merely $14 a day at 20, and you do that for 35 years straight, with a 10 percent interest rate (which is a conservative estimate), by the time you\u2019re 55, you\u2019ll be able to retire with a staggering fortune of $1,6 dollars.\nHowever, the main thing you should learn here is that these $14 are a priority: you need to set them aside first and \ndo everything else after.\nMost people are actually doing it very wrong: it doesn\u2019t make sense to first pay your taxes, rent, and insurance and then pay yourself; David Bach says: first, do the latter, and then the former.\nHere\u2019s what that means!\n$14 a day equals to about $5,000 dollars a year.\nNow, if you pay yourself after paying your taxes, and you\u2019re like Jim McIntyre, and you earn about $40,000 a year, then you\u2019ll be setting aside $5,000 dollars out of $28,000 (at a 30% tax rate), leaving you with $22,000 to spread across 12 months.\nHowever, if you set a pre-tax retirement fund and automate the process of \u201cPaying Yourself First,\u201d then this money will only be taxed when you withdraw it, at a probably lower rate than the current one.\nIn numbers, $40,000 (your wages) \u2013 $5,000 (retirement money) = $35,000 (taxed money).\n30% out of $35,000 is 10,500, leaving you with $24,500.\nAnd $24,500 is $2,500 more than $22,000!\nOver 35 years, that\u2019s $87,500 more!\nSee: it makes \n of financial sense to set up a pre-tax retirement account!\nChapter Four: Now Make It Automatic\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019ve heard all this before,\u201d writes David Bach at the beginning of Chapter 4, \u201cand you already know what \n Paying Yourself First costs you. Having this knowledge hasn\u2019t changed your life before, so why should anything be different now?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d he goes on, \u201cthe difference is, this time you\u2019re going to take control. This time you\u2019re going to Make It Automatic.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no getting around it \u2013 he says: \u201cin order for Pay Yourself First to be effective, the process has to be automatic.\u201d\nWhy?\nBecause people are not disciplined enough to follow a certain routine over longer periods of time; and machines do exactly \n: no excuses and no questions asked.\n\u201cWhatever you decide to do with the money you\u2019re paying yourself,\u201d concludes Bach, \u201cyou need to have a system that doesn\u2019t depend on your following a budget or being disciplined.\u201d\nSimply put, if the money is automatically taken from you, you won\u2019t be able to spend it.\nIn other (David Bach\u2019s) words, if you want to make it work, you should:\n\u2022 Make sure you\u2019re signed up for your retirement account at work (or IRA or SEP IRA or One-Person 401(k)/Profit-Sharing Plan, depending on your situation);\n\u2022 Decide how much you are going to contribute to your account each month (ideally, the maximum amount allowed).\n\u2022 Decide how you want to invest your retirement contributions.\n\u2022 Whatever type of account you open, arrange to have your contributions \ntransferred into it, either through payroll deduction at work or an automatic investment plan run by the bank or brokerage firm where you\u2019ve set up your retirement account.\nChapter Five: Automate for a Rainy Day\nOf course, life doesn\u2019t always work perfectly.\nIn fact, quite the opposite.\nOftentimes, people lose their jobs or have to deal with health problems (both their own or their loved ones) or even devastating natural disasters.\nAnd, as they say, even though you should help for the best, you must always be prepared for the worst.\nThat\u2019s why a pre-tax retirement fund is just one part of the story; the other is, of course, an emergency fund.\nAccording to stats, the average American has less than three months\u2019 worth of expenses saved up for emergencies.\nSimply put, that\u2019s not enough.\nIn fact, far from it!\nAn emergency fund should amount anywhere between 6- and 18-months\u2019 worth of wages to actually be considered some kind of financial net.\nOf course, with that amount of money saved up, there\u2019s an added \u2013 and often underestimated \u2013 bonus: quality of life.\nIn other words, of course you\u2019re going to work overtime to \nlose your job if you have only 3 months\u2019 worth of savings aside! Have a year and a half, and you can say \u201cno\u201d when you think it is appropriate to say \u201cno\u201d \u2013 because, even in the worst-case scenario, you\u2019ll certainly find a job in a few months (meaning: there will be still some money left in your emergency fund!)\nSo, what you should do?\nOnce again, \n put aside 5 percent from every paycheck for an emergency fund; and don\u2019t spend this money under no circumstance whatsoever \u2013 until you really, really need it!\nAlso, don\u2019t keep it in a jar somewhere in your kitchen; invest it and see it grow with time.\nChapter Six: Automatic Debt-Free Homeownership\nAs we said above \u2013 and as Thomas Piketty demonstrated with authority \u2013 homeowners are rich; renters are poor.\nThe sad part?\nOver their lives, renters usually pay other homeowners more than they would have paid to buy their own house!\nIn other words, it makes absolutely no sense to rent a house \u2013 make the decision to buy one as soon as possible.\nWorried that something might go wrong?\nHere\u2019s a reassuring fact: only 2% of American homeowners are evicted for failing to pay off their mortgage!\n\u201cThe secret to being an Automatic Millionaire is keeping it simple,\u201d says David Bach. \u201cSo, here\u2019s what you do. Find yourself that home you want and buy it.\u201d\nNext, get a 30-year mortgage and use an automatic biweekly payment plan to pay it down.\nWhat\u2019s a biweekly payment plan?\nIt\u2019s one of the greatest financial tips you\u2019ll ever hear: instead of making a monthly payment for your mortgage, split it down the middle and pay half every two weeks.\nNow, there are 52 weeks a year, meaning, you\u2019ll be making half-payments 26 weeks a year; that amounts to 13 monthly payments a year, i.e., you get a full year every 12 years.\nIn other words, you\u2019ll pay out a 30-year mortgage about 3 years earlier at least.\nAnd that\u2019s not the only miracle!\nThe other is even better.\nWe\u2019ll let David Bach explain it to you:\n\u201cUsing a monthly payment plan to pay off a $250,000 30-year mortgage with an interest rate of 5 percent will cost you a total of $233,139.46 in interest charges over the life of the loan. On a biweekly basis, the same mortgage will cost you a total of just $188,722.13 in interest.\u201d\nIn other words, switching to the biweekly plan will save you more than $44,000!\nChapter Seven: The Automatic Debt-Free Lifestyle\nEasier said than done, right?\nAfter all, how can you think about automatically setting aside funds for retirement or buying a house and making biweekly mortgage payments when you\u2019re already in so much debt? \nNeedless to say, debt is not compatible with being a wealthy person, let alone a millionaire. As we\u2019ve learned from \n, the rich usually don\u2019t act rich, i.e., they don\u2019t go in debt to buy a new Porsche.\nSo, if you want to be a rich person, one of the first things you should do is get rid of your debts. And like everything else \u2013 you should do it automatically!\nThe process consists of several steps:\nWhatever the advertisements say, they don\u2019t exist to make \nrich but to bring more money to the banks which issued them;\nThis is especially important since credit card\u2019s interest rates are usually very high \u2013 sometimes as high as 18%.\nWhat this means, in reality, is that, if you only pay minimum monthly payments, you\u2019ll probably pay in interest just as much as you\u2019ve originally spent!\nNow, if you threaten your credit card provider that you\u2019re unhappy with their service and you want to switch, you\u2019ll probably get a much lower interest rate on your debt.\nNow, if your debt is spread across multiple accounts, try to move it all into one \u2013 preferably the one with the lowest rate.\nIf that is not possible, start paying off the cards one by one, starting with the one with the lowest ratio of outstanding balance to minimum payment.\nAnd after you\u2019re done DOLPing your credit card accounts \u2013 cancel all of them.\nStep four is a simple decision: to devote half the money you Pay Yourself First to paying off your balance.\nFinally, make it automatic, by arranging for your credit card company to debit that amount from your checking account each month.\nChapter Eight: Make a Difference with Automatic Tithing\n\u201cWe make a living by what we earn,\u201d said once Winston Churchill, \u201cwe make a life by what we give.\u201d\n\u201cBecoming an Automatic Millionaire,\u201d adds David Koch in arguably the strangest chapter of a book about becoming a millionaire ever, \u201cis not simply about accumulating wealth. It\u2019s also about relieving stress and worries about the future \u2013 about putting yourself in a place that enables you to enjoy life now as well as in the future.\u201d\nAnd a good way to make more sense of your current life is becoming a giver of money.\nYup, you\u2019ve heard that right: Bach thinks that a part of the journey to becoming a wealthy person is deciding to give away some of your money to charity.\n.\nWhy?\nLet us list four reasons.\nFirst of all, it will make you feel like a millionaire right away: it\u2019s not like poor people give money to charity, right?\nSecondly, you\u2019ll hardly even notice it if you start with 1 percent of your salary; that\u2019s basically no more than $30 if you earn $3,000 a month.\nThirdly, charitable donations are tax-deductible, which means that it\u2019s even less than $30 in the long run.\nAnd finally \u2013 and most importantly \u2013 giving\naway money will make you feel a lot better feeding you with the necessary energy and joy to live a better life on a daily basis.\nAnd isn\u2019t that what money is supposed to do?\nChapter Nine: The Automatic Millionaire Blueprint\nThe last chapter of \nis nothing more than a recap of the book, coupled with a very handy diagram you can download from \n.\nYou already know what the steps mean, so what are you waiting for?\nStart automating and retire in thirty years as a charitable, debt-free millionaire\nwith at least one house!\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Automatic Millionaire\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You Can Become a Millionaire No Matter How Much You Earn\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Making It Automatic in Less Than an Hour\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Pro Tip: Buy a House and Pay Your Mortgage in a Biweekly Installments\nYou Can Become a Millionaire No Matter How Much You Earn with the Latte Factor\n\u201cIn order to become an Automatic Millionaire,\u201d writes David Bach at the beginning of his book, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to accept the idea that regardless of the size of your paycheck, you probably already make enough money to become rich.\u201d\nIn other words, it really doesn\u2019t matter how much you earn; what matters is how much \u2013 and how smart \u2013 you save.\nIt\u2019s simple math, really: if, instead of buying yourself a latte and a doughnut every day, you save and invest those $5, with an average of 10% annual return, you\u2019ll be worth about $1,5 dollars in 40 years\u2019 time.\nMeaning, if you start this plan when you\u2019re 20, you\u2019ll retire as a millionaire at 60.\nMaking It Automatic in Less Than an Hour\nThe key, however, is to \n money automatically: if it comes to discipline and willpower, you\u2019ll probably fail. \nIt\u2019s as simple as that.\nJust follow these seven steps, and you\u2019re \n to become a millionaire by your retirement age:\n#1. Pay yourself first automatically;\n#2. Deposit your paycheck automatically;\n#3. Fund your \u201crainy day\u201d emergency account automatically;\n#4. Fund your dream account automatically;\n#5. Pay your credit card bills automatically;\n#6. Pay all your monthly bills automatically;\n#7. Give to charity automatically.\nA Pro Tip: Buy a House and Pay Your Mortgage in a Biweekly Installments\nPoor people pay rents; rich people own houses.\nThe worst part: over time, poor people end up paying for rents just enough money to buy themselves a house.\nIn other words: choose the house you like right away, and buy it!\nGet a 30-year mortgage rate and start paying it off in biweekly instalments.\nMeaning, instead of making one monthly payment, make a half-payment every two weeks.\nThat way, you\u2019ll end up paying out the mortgage a few years earlier (there are 52 weeks a year, so you\u2019ll make 26 half-payments or one monthly payment more with a biweekly payment plan) and you\u2019ll save a lot of money on interest rates!\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nThe Automatic Millionaire Quotes\nFinal Notes\nAs he makes clear at the very beginning of the book, David Bach is pretty aware that most of the advices in \nare not new; however, he\u2019s more than certain that the main one is: make it automatic.\nAt least theoretically, that should make all the difference: automatically paying yourself first means you don\u2019t have to worry about willpower and self-discipline to save money, making sure that you\u2019ll save them.And that advice alone makes this book more than worthy addition to\n floating around ever since people invented money.\n\n"},

And Why?\nIf you want to learn what is it that makes an inventor a bit different from the other people or you want to become one, then \n is the right book for you.\nIt is a great addition to a budding field of study \u2013 and inventology is a great name for it \u2013 which includes books like \n, \n,\nand even \nIf you like this book, be sure to check the others as well.\nInventology Summary\nAs its subtitle aptly suggests, \n is a \u201cdelightful account\u201d of how we dream up things that change the world; hence the neologism from the title which can be roughly translated as \u201cthe science of inventions.\u201d\nPagan Kennedy\u2019s book is divided into five parts: \u201cProblem Finding,\u201d \u201cDiscovery,\u201d \u201cProphecy,\u201d \u201cConnecting\u201d and \u201cEmpowerment,\u201d each of which contains between two and four chapters.\nNot all of the titles of the sections below mirror the titles of the chapters in \n \u2013 neither we have the time and space to cover them all.\nHowever \u2013 and as always \u2013 we did cover what we found most interesting and most engaging.\nEnjoy!\nPart I: Problem Finding\nPart I of \n delves into \n.\n\u201cWe will look at how creative people,\u201d the author writes, \u201cuse their frustration as a doorway into the imagination.\u201d\n\u201cAccording to an old saw,\u201d she goes on, \u201cnecessity is the mother of invention; that\u2019s certainly true, but the adage is annoyingly vague. What kind of necessity works best to help reveal the outlines of a hidden problem? Why do some frustrations lead to a big idea, while most don\u2019t? And can we learn from someone else\u2019s pain?\u201d\nLet\u2019s find answers to these questions.\nImagine having to carry your 32kg luggage by hand; even more \u2013 imagine having to carry two 32kg suitcases in the same manner?\nSeems exhausting to even think about it, doesn\u2019t it?\nWell, most probably, your parents and grandparents had to do exactly that!\nEven though such an important part of the lives of so many regular travelers of the world, wheeled suitcases are a pretty recent invention.\nThe first suitcase designed for airports is not even half a century old and dates back to 1970, when Bernard D. Sadow, a vice president at a luggage company had to schlepp two heavy suitcases to an airport.\nAnd then he noticed a workman pushing a machine on a dolly.\nCue a lightbulb moment: after devising a prototype or two, very soon Sadow patented a suitcase that sat squarely on rollers, with a flexible strap attached to it.\nCarrying this suitcase was pretty much similar like walking your dog: you pulled it behind on a leash, but you also had to be careful not to pull it too hard \u2013 otherwise you might end up hitting yourself. \nEnter Robert Plath, an airline pilot.\nAbout a decade after Sadow\u2019s invention, he introduced quite a few improvements which made the wheeled suitcase the beloved commodity that is today.\nIn retrospect, one is bound to ask himself/herself a question: why didn\u2019t Sadow think of these improvements?\nThe answer, writes Pagan Kennedy, is quite simple.\nFor Bernard Sadow \u2013 being a businessman on vacation \u2013 the wheeled suitcase was a \u201cshort-term form of necessity.\u201d \nHowever, Plath, by virtue of his job, \u201cPlath was already living in the future, when flying would become a commonplace misery.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why he was \n to think deeply about this problem: he had to deal with it on a daily basis.\nAs we have already reminded you, in \n (1776), Adam Smith uses a famous pin factory study to suggest that \u201cdivision of labor is an incredibly effective way to achieve higher efficiency in the production process.\u201d\nSmith goes a step further: in a pin factory where one man does one job only, he says, each laborer becomes an expert in a small field, and this may eventually result in him finding out \u201ceasier and readier methods of performing\u201d his job.\nIn other words, according to Adam Smith, in addition to increasing productivity, specialization also turns all workmen into inventors.\nAnd he even offers an example.\n\u201cFor instance,\u201d relates Kennedy, \u201che noticed a boy who was supposed to pump a lever in time with a piston. This relentless, grinding task inspired the boy to figure out an ingenious workaround: he tied a string between the lever and a moving part elsewhere on the machine. Now the machine itself pulled the lever for him. After automating his job, the boy skipped off to play with friends.\u201d\nMany years later \u2013 i.e., about a decade ago \u2013 the American economist Eric von Hippel put this otherwise: \u201cI\u2019ve learned personally that you can get a graduate student to do a lot of things, but you can\u2019t get them to do it twenty thousand times in a row, [because] they will start to invent.\u201d\nIn other words, nobody likes to do mechanical things forever; and, after a certain number of hours, he/she turns into a Lead User, an inventor out of frustration.\nThis is the reason why mountain bikes were invented by bike hobbyists who had to ride over boulders and tree stumps in the woods.\nSince he had worked both as an engineer and as an academic, Ernst Hippel used his experiences from his previous field to devise a now-famous academic theory on the genesis of lead users.\nTheoretically, anyone who encounters a frustrating problem lacking an off-the-shelf solution can become one; however, the most valuable kind of frustration seems to be the one which has these three components:\n#1. It plays out over a long period of time, thus inspiring more and better solutions;\n#2. It reveals a hidden problem that is difficult to detect;\n#3. It forecasts a problem that will affect thousands or millions of people in the future.\nLet us sum up this for you:\nWant to become an inventor?\nJust start doing something many people are doing but is considered boring \u2013 over and over again; after some time, you\u2019d grow tired of doing that; and that\u2019s when you\u2019ll suddenly start thinking like an inventor.\nPart II: Discovery\nIf Part I deals with problem finding and people who have a deep understanding of a problem, Part II turns its attention to inventors who operate in exactly the opposite manner.\nNamely, people who \u201cstumble across a \u2018preexisting solution,\u2019 and then they work backward to figure out how to match it to a need.\u201d\nLet\u2019s find out more about the role of serendipity in the creative process.\nThey say that while the unsuccessful ones look for excuses and consider themselves unlucky, the successful ones are capable of making their own luck.\nBut is it true?\nWell, according to quite a few experiments, it isn\u2019t wrong.\nFor example, in the 1990s, a British psychology professor by the name of Richard Wiseman \u201cbegan to suspect that people who feel \u201clucky\u201d tend to be especially observant\u2014and that their ability to scan their surroundings makes it easier for them to notice useful clues in their environment.\u201d\nTo test out his theory, he devised a simple experiment.\nFirst, he gathered two groups of people: some who considered themselves lucky and blessed, and others cursed and unlucky. Then he gave them a newspaper asking them to count the number of photographs inside.\nThe trick?\nOn the second page, there was a small note saying: \u201cStop counting \u2013 there are 43 photographs in this newspaper.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, the blessed ones noticed this message much more often than the cursed ones.\nA lucky coincidence?\n would beg to differ.\nIn a famous experiment, he gathered a group of art students and asked them to pick out and draw objects from a previously set-up room.\nOne group treaded the easier path: they started drawing immediately, the first thing they noticed; the other group took time and started drawing only after carefully examining the objects in the room.\nSeven years later, the former were struggling to meet ends, and most of the latter became professional artists.\nBack in the 1990s, Sanda Erdelez devised a name for the more observant, lucky ones.\nShe named them the Super-Encounterers.\nTheir main trait: they \nthe search, boasting \u201cchannels for information perception that are more sensitive than the channels of other[s].\u201d\nAre you one of them?\nSuper-Encounterers make their own luck by \n and, thus, \n more things than other people. \nIf you read that sentence carefully and didn\u2019t skip the title of this section, you already know something scientists just discovered: an inventor with a proper algorithm is a better inventor than a Super-Encounterer or a Lead User.\nWhy?\nWell, two words:\n.\nIt means exactly what you think it means: millions and billions of articles systemized in such a manner that makes them searchable within days \u2013 or even hours.\nHence, one should not be surprised by a new breed of inventors currently active in laboratories and universities worldwide: the bioinformaticians.\nThese people, in the words of Kennedy, \u201chope to find a way to speed up and engineer their luck by using computers to scan the results of thousands of past experiments in order to detect unexpected connections.\u201d\nHas it worked?\nOf course it has!\nConsider a drug called imipramine, an antidepressant around for more than half a century.\nUsing big-data-mining algorithms, Atul Butte \u2013 a biomedical researcher and entrepreneur who heads up the University of California San Francisco\u2019s Institute for Computational Health Sciences \u2013 discovered a pattern which suggested that imipramine could be effective in fighting small-cell lung cancer.\nA few experiments later, and this was published as a fact in the journal \nNow, it\u2019s not like someone else couldn\u2019t have stumbled upon this patter while reading a few of these articles; however, deliberate focus, basically, works as an instigator of serendipity.\nWhich means that bioinformaticians are \ncreating their own luck.\n\u201cNothing will come out of nothing,\u201d wrote Shakespeare in \nat the beginning of the 17\n century.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say!\u201d \u2013 replied the little-known Lawrence Herbert in the 1960s.\nA recent Hofstra University graduate, in 1956, Herbert was hired by the brothers Morris and Jesse Levine at their advertising company as a part-time employee.\nSince he was put in charge of the ink and printing division \u2013 and he knew a bit of chemistry \u2013 Herbert noticed something devastating.\nNamely, because \u201cevery designer had about a half a dozen color books in his drawer\u201d and because \u201cevery ink company used different sets of pigments which react differently under different lights,\u201d he couldn\u2019t be sure what color he would get when sending out orders for ink.\nSo, he thought of a brilliant solution: what if, he began to imagine, all printers and ink makers could speak a universal language?\nUnder this scheme, he remembers, \u201cif somebody in New York wanted something printed in Tokyo, they would just simply open up the book and say, \u2018Give me Pantone 123.\u2019\u201d\nAnd be sure that this color (a daffodil yellow) would look exactly like the one ordered.\nSo, Herbert created a sample page to introduce this system to other ink makers and after a bunch of \u201cschmoozing, trading favors, and building up alliances with graphic designers and ink companies,\u201d he devised the Pantone Matching System.\nEventually, he bought out the debt of the company he was working for and in a few decades became a multimillionaire. \nNow let\u2019s go down a bit to make Kennedy\u2019s point.\nWhat Herbert started with was absolutely nothing but an idea: no money, no connections, no experience. \nAnd because of him, we have Pantone today.\nYou really think you have an excuse not to do something with your life?\nPart III: Prophecy\n and \n\u2013 as you\u2019ll see in a moment \u2013 play a big part in the process of inventing things.\nThat\u2019s why Part III explores \u201cinvention as it relates to prediction, prophecy, and science-fiction dreams.\u201d\nMore precisely: \u201cWhat sorts of people first imagine that future? How do they do it? And how do they communicate their vision to the rest of us?\u201d\nWayne Gretzky is the Michael Jordan of hockey; well, even more than that: there are basically no LeBrons or Kobes in hockey and with the exception of a \u201cWhat-If-Lemieux,\u201d nobody comes even close to Gretzky.\nHe is universally acclaimed as the greatest hockey player ever.\nYou know why?\nBecause he was able to anticipate, to predict the movement of the puck better than the rest, i.e., because he saw a second more into the future than those around him.\nGreat inventors share this capability.\nIn his \n, William Blake wrote that \u201cwhat is now proved was once only imagined,\u201d and, that\u2019s the essence of the so-called Wayne Gretzky Game.\nWant to invent something people would use in the future?\nWell, start off by imagining the future. If you could see, for example, flying cars there, then there is a good reason you should start working on developing one.\nThat\u2019s exactly what happened with a bunch of people in the 1970s: they were able to see a personal computer in everyone\u2019s home when barely few had even seen one.\nYup, we\u2019re talking about a story we\u2019ve already recounted in our summaries: \nNow, if you\u2019ve read our summary of \n,\nyou already know full well that it was a Vannevar Bush essay that inspired Engelbart that inspired Microsoft and Apple.\nWhat if that essay not only \nbut also \nthe future?\nIt is more than possible.\nJust think of the more-than-famous \n, according to which computing power doubles every year and a half.\nAccording to its very postulator, even though originally an observation, it has turned into a directive: people in the industry \n to fall behind it.\nThus, Gordon Moore has both predicted and shaped the future.\nUnfortunately, Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla \u2013 aka the man who brought us the 21\n century \u2013didn\u2019t have that much luck in his life: he died, quite poor, alone and forgotten, in a hotel room in New York in January 1943.\nFortunately, at least since the 1990s, he has not only been lifted from obscurity but turned into the archetypal brilliant scientist ahead of his time and capable of devising inventions basically at will.\nAnd for a reason: Tesla was indeed capable of doing this, his laboratory being more mental than an actual one.\n\u201cEvery night (and sometimes during the day), when alone, I would start on my journeys \u2013 see new places, cities, and countries \u2013live there, meet people and make friendships and acquaintances,\u201d he wrote later in his life.\n\u201cThis I did constantly until I was about seventeen when my thoughts turned seriously to invention. Then I observed to my delight that I could visualize with the greatest facility. I needed no models, drawings, or experiments. I could picture them all as real in my mind. Thus, I have been led unconsciously to evolve what I consider a new method of materializing inventive concepts and ideas.\u201d \n\u201cBefore I put a sketch on paper,\u201d Tesla concludes, \u201cthe whole idea is worked out mentally. In my mind, I change the construction, make improvements, and even operate the device.\u201d\nIn a way, that\u2019s exactly what you should start doing right away \u2013 don\u2019t make us requote William Blake here as well.\nHowever, be careful not to go overboard and become a Robert Desnos, a French Surrealist poet who, whenever asleep, put a sign before his door stating that \u201cthe Poet is working;\u201d how would we know if you don\u2019t put that on paper, Robert?\nPart IV: Connecting\n\u201cIn Part IV of this book,\u201d writes Kennedy, \u201cwe will look at how invention benefits from open systems, and specifically from the people who thrive in a connected world. Breakthroughs often happen when we allow unlikely collaborators and odd bedfellows to share our problems, or when we leap across boundaries.\u201d\nConsider, for example, John Harrison, an 18\n-century British carpenter, and clockmaker.\nIn 1714, seven years after the disastrous Scilly shipwreck which claimed the lives of thousands because of bad naval navigation, members of British Parliament promised to award a fortune ($3 million in today\u2019s dollars) to one capable of improving it.\nJohn Harrison was the guy who claimed the prize, producing a marine clock accurate down to the second. This clock allowed sailors \u201cto calculate longitude by comparing the precise clock readings with the position of the stars and the sun; it was time, as much as celestial maps, that turned out to be key to solving the problem.\u201d\nWhy was the humble John Harrison \u2013 of all people \u2013 capable of making such a breakthrough?\nSimply put, because he was able to bring together knowledge from more than one relevant field: he was able to both craft gears and springs with precision, but he was also able to connect his knowledge of timekeeping with navigation.\nAs Kennedy says, there \u201care certain people who \u2013 by luck, design, or some quirk of personality \u2013 are able to bring together knowledge from several fields. They inhabit the cracks and interstices between different disciplines.\u201d\nAnd, ultimately, they are capable of making leaps others can\u2019t even imagine.\nPart V: Empowerment\nPart V of \n explores \u201cthe challenges of empowerment.\u201d\n\u201cIt takes enormous courage to claim a problem,\u201d Kennedy writes. \u201cWhen you dare to tackle a big question, you may face ridicule, rejection, and opposition. So how do you grant yourself permission to invent?\u201d\nLook no further than the Soviet engineer, inventor, and scientist Genrich Altshuller.\nHe was a brilliant young man \u2013 possibly even just too brilliant for his own sake under a totalitarian regime.\nAn SF enthusiast \u2013 later in life, he basically earned his living writing science fiction novels in collaboration with his wife \u2013 Altshuller dreamt of a world far different than the one haunted by Stalin\u2019s Great Purge.\nHe dreamt of a world where everyone can be an inventor.\nSo, after noticing the drop in inventions in USSR, soon after the Second World War, together with his friend Raphael Shapiro, he wrote a letter to Stalin in which he advocated such a form of education.\nAbbreviated as TRIZ, this new educative practice is still described as \u201ca problem-solving, analysis and forecasting tool derived from the study of patterns of invention in the global patent literature.\u201d\nQuestioning Stalin\u2019s method was never a great idea, and it was especially not so in 1950. So, Altshuller and Shapiro ended up in a labor camp.\nDid this make him give up his dreams?\nOn the contrary: it merely fueled him to work more and more.\nAfter he was freed by Khrushchev three years later, Altshuller continued reviewing patents to develop several still-studied and used concepts in innovation: the ideality of a system, technical contradictions, and contradiction matrix and the 40 principles of TRIZ, the general principles of invention.\nYou\u2019d think he died a rich man, wouldn\u2019t you?\nGuess again: he didn\u2019t want any money.\nAltshuller just wanted a better world for everybody.\nKey Lessons from \u201cInventology\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Everyone Can Become a Lead User and an Inventor\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Play the Wayne Gretzky Game (It\u2019s Not Hockey) and Become an Inventor\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Connect Two Disparate Fields of Endeavor to See the World Differently\nEveryone Can Become a Lead User and an Inventor\nAdam Smith was the first to notice that regular laborers can become inventors when they specialize enough doing a certain task.\nCenturies after him, Ernst von Hippel devised the lead user theory to explain how this came to be.\nSimply put, if a job can be automated and breeds frustration in the one who\u2019s tasked doing it, then, after a certain number of repetitions (say, 20,000), the worker starts thinking like an inventor.\nIn other words, he starts thinking of ways to ease his burden.\nAnd isn\u2019t that exactly what inventors do?\nPlay the Wayne Gretzky Game (It\u2019s Not Hockey) and Become an Inventor\nWayne Gretzky is widely considered the greatest hockey player in history for a reason: he was able to anticipate and predict the movement of a puck much better than anyone else.\nWell, most inventors are just like that: they are able to predict the future much better than us, regular Joes.\nThat\u2019s what the Wayne Gretzky Game is all about.\nThink of it this way: problem solving, by definition, deals with obvious things, i.e., problems which are a manifestation of the current worldview.\nIn the Wayne Gretzky Game, you imagine the world few decades in the future, and then you figure out the technology \u201cdestined to exist, based on what you\u2019d predicted about the evolution of machines and about human needs and desires.\u201d\nAnd then it\u2019s time for sketches, videos, and stories about the technology.\nIn other words, using the Wayne Gretzky Game, you do not deal with solving current problems but envisioning and solving the problems of the future.\nIsn\u2019t that better?\nConnect Two Disparate Fields of Endeavor to See the World Differently\nA guy named John Harrison became an instant millionaire at the beginning of the 18\n century because he was not only a carpenter and a clockmaker, but also knew something about naval navigation.\nThis allowed him to build a marine clock accurate down to the second and claim a hefty prize for the invention from the British Parliament.\nWhy was he able to come up with one?\nSimply put: \u201cby luck, design, or some quirk of personality,\u201d he fused together knowledge from different disciplines.\nThink of it this way: how many people there were in the 18\n century capable of crafting clocks and knowing a thing or two about naval navigation?\nExactly.\nNow, \n.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nInventology Quotes\nFinal Notes\nis a great, great book.\n\u201cA delightful account of how inventors do what they do,\u201d (\n)\nthe book \u201coffers a new perspective into the process of invention that will inform and illuminate.\u201d (\n)\nAnd it is well-written, nicely structured, and engaging from cover to cover.\nHighly recommended."},

And Why?\nis for everybody who has at least one shelf of his/her home library filled with about twenty how-to manuals for diet, health, work efficiency, sex life, etc.\nWell, this book can replace them all.\n\u201cThe best way to change your life is to change what your life is made up of \u2013 your rituals, your habits, how you eat and think,\u201d writes Ryan Holiday in his review of \n. \u201cThis book is a road map for doing exactly that, written by an author whose results can\u2019t be argued with.\u201d\nOwn the Day, Own Your Life Summary\nEven if you have never heard of Aubrey Marcus, you probably already know a lot about Onnit, \u201cone of the fastest-growing human performance companies in America.\u201d\nWell, Aubrey Marcus is the guy who founded the company about a decade ago; also, the guy who popularized the concept of \u201ctotal human optimization\u201d which is exactly what this 500-page mammoth of a book is all about.\nLet\u2019s put it this way: its subtitle \u2013 Optimized Practices for Waking, Working, Learning, Eating, Training, Playing, Sleeping, and Sex \u2013 is definitely not an exaggeration.\nSo, what are we waiting for?\n1: Water. Light. Morning\nAubrey Marcus\u2019 book begins with a quote from none other than \n: \u201cwell begun is half done.\u201d For a reason: the first chapter is dedicated to waking up and the things which happen in the half hour after. \n\u201cHow you wake up sets the tone for your day,\u201d writes Marcus. \u201cDo you slide out of bed and slink through your social media, or do you have purpose in your actions?\u201d\nWhen put this way, it\u2019s not a choice, is it?\nAnd yet \u2013 you go on making the wrong one.\n\u201cWe are highly sensitive to momentum,\u201d notes Marcus. \u201cBy starting your morning off with intention, you set your day off on an important positive trajectory.\u201d\nWant us to put this as simple as 1-2-3?\nHere it is:\n#1. Hydrate immediately, because most of us are chronically dehydrated, especially in the morning (after 7 hours of sleep in a dry climate, what would you expect?); do not \u2013 we repeat \u2013 \ndrink any coffee!\n#2. Then seek light \u2013 but not artificial one: open the blinds and stop being a bat;\n#3. Finally, get moving to reset your internal clock.\nNow, your day is \u201cprimed for perfection.\u201d\n2: Deep Breath, Deep Freeze\n\u201cBreath and the cold are the best friends you never knew you had,\u201d writes Marcus at the beginning of the second chapter of \n.\nReally, you say? Have has he ever spend at least two hours in a hot morning or evening shower?\nYes, he has, in fact, and has realized that it is too cozy and comfortable to be good for your health and wellbeing.\nThe key word here is \n.\nIn scientific terms, \n is \u201ca biological phenomenon in which low-dose exposure to an environmental agent (called a \u2018hormetic stressor\u2019) produces a beneficial effect, while a higher-dose exposure produces a toxic effect.\u201d\nIn layman\u2019s terms, this \u201codd duality\u201d has been best summed up by \n\u2019s famous maxim: \u201cWhat does not kill me makes me stronger.\u201d\nIn other words, if you want to fight stress, fight it with a proper dose of good, acute stress, aka cold shower.\nWhy?\nWell, simply put, \u201cbecause each morning needs to involve the rush that comes with exposing yourself to nature\u2019s extremes for a few minutes and the willpower you cultivate in the process.\u201d\n3: More Fat, Less Sugar, or Don\u2019t Eat\nOur dear old Father of the Nation, \n, once noted that you need to \u201ceat to live\u201d and not \u201clive to eat.\u201d\nMarcus Aubrey starts from there and then goes on to dispel quite a few myths related to our diet.\nThe main two: breakfast is \nthe most important meal of the day and, far from being bad, dietary fat and cholesterol are actually good for your metabolic health and proper weight.\nIf you don\u2019t believe him, just look at a picture of him, and you\u2019ll realize in the blink of an eye that he\u2019s not lying.\nIn other words, if his dietary habits made his body, then it\u2019s probably right to say that these are not bad dietary habits.\nHis advice?\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have good fats and protein available to you, rather than eat a bunch of sugary or starchy foods, you can skip breakfast and reap the benefits of intermittent fasting for weight loss and longevity.\u201d\nIn other words, either eat a fatty breakfast or eat no breakfast at all.\n4: Essential Supplements\nNow, it is easy to say skip breakfast\nif the only thing you can eat is cereals, but it isn\u2019t always like that in practice: modern life is both just too stressful and too unpredictable. \nMeaning: if you skip the cereals for breakfast, you often end up eating them for lunch (due to lack of time and the need for some instant energy), which is, of course, much, much worse.\nEven though \u201cgetting the right amount of sun, sleep, and food is itself a kind of supplementation, and the first line of defense,\u201d Aubrey notes that supplementation proper has also become something of a fact of life.\nAnd there are two reasons why you should supplement: \u201cto remediate potential deficiencies and to gain access to unusual or hard-to-find nutrients.\u201d\nAubrey offers an introduction to most of them, but he wheedles out as the key things to consider supplementing these five: greens, probiotics, B vitamins, krill oil, and vitamin D.\n5: Drive Time, Alive Time\nNo matter where you live, chances are that you spend at least an hour traveling to work every day; and probably you spend just as much traveling back.\nThis is what Aubrey Marcus refers to as \u201cdrive time,\u201d and he is right in saying that for most people this \u201cdrive time\u201d is pretty much synonymous with \u201cdead time.\u201d\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t have to be that way \u2013 at least not today.\nPodcasts and audiobooks abound, and conscious breathing techniques and \n practices are always there to help you practice greater presence and peace of mind.\nUse this to your benefit.\n6: The Power Plants\nThough it is not good to start your day with a cup of coffee, says Aubrey Marcus, it is also a bad idea to eliminate caffeine altogether from your regular routine \u2013 because, let\u2019s face it, it doesn\u2019t only keep you from falling asleep during those dreadful Friday meetings but it also improves your mood on a daily basis.\nEven more controversially, Marcus says that nicotine can be beneficial as well (\u201cto focus, attention, and the enjoyment of your day\u201d), and that the only problems with it come with the delivery.\n\u201cThe problem with tobacco,\u201d he quotes Don Howard Lawler, \u201cis inhaling it.\u201d\nIn other words, if you can get used to vaping or absorbing nicotine through your skin or your gums in healthy dosages, then, by all means, do it.\nAnd don\u2019t stay away from nootropics as well: the \n, for example, has been rigorously tested ever since ancient China and, apparently, it helps both with memory and cognitive performance.\nDon\u2019t believe Marcus?\nWell, try it out!\n7: Doin\u2019 Work\n\u201cFind something you love to do,\u201d \n, \u201cand you\u2019ll never have to work a day in your life.\u201d\nThough this is true, it is not exactly phrased well: \u201cmore important than enjoying every minute of the work you do,\u201d notes Marcus, \u201cis knowing \n you are doing it. This is your mission, and being certain of that mission will allow you to flourish even in challenging situations.\u201d\nIn other words, never underestimate \n: it is the difference between what is worth doing and what is not and the keyword in doing the former more creatively and more efficiently.\n8: Eat a Weird Lunch\nOK \u2013 that\u2019s a bit of strange advice!\nHowever, as you read into the chapter, you\u2019ll realize that it is also one of the best ones you can ever hear in relation to your dietary practices.\n\u201cLunch is an opportunity to reframe and restart your day,\u201d writes Aubrey Marcus. \u201cIt\u2019s not an obligation to cross off the list. It\u2019s also an opportunity to get your body the micronutrients it needs to keep you feeling great. The way to do that isn\u2019t with something ordered off a cart. It\u2019s by experimenting and exploring. It\u2019s by taking my hometown\u2019s motto to heart, and \n it weird.\u201d\nPut simply, don\u2019t eat the same thing every day because that\u2019s the easiest thing to do.\nAlso, don\u2019t eat antinutrients, i.e., \u201chighly processed, refined, burned, fried, or artificial foods and colorings.\u201d\nJust ask yourself this question: what would have been available to your ancient ancestors for lunch?\nWell, eat that \u2013 and mix it up constantly.\n9: The Binaural Power Nap\nYou know the feeling: you\u2019ve just finished your lunch and the only thing you can do at the moment is, well, nothing; you\u2019re just too sleepy to do anything.\nMarcus Aubrey\u2019s advice?\nListen to your body.\nInstead of fighting the post-lunch nap-reflex, just go with it: just thirty minutes of sleep will recharge your batteries and restore your mental capacities to their best.\nOur pretty rational tip:\nDon\u2019t eat lunch at work.\n10: Training\nLet\u2019s face it: the only reason why you\u2019re not exercising is that you\u2019re just too lazy to do it. \nIt\u2019s not because you don\u2019t believe the hype or doubt the benefits of good training.\nConsequently, we feel no need to advocate exercising here: as Marcus Aubrey says succinctly, \u201cexercise is a miracle drug \u2013 you just need to take it.\u201d\nNow, if you haven\u2019t exercised before, start slowly because otherwise you\u2019ll overtrain and overstrain yourself from the beginning.\nAnd then move on to more difficult and, finally, more unconventional equipment: kettlebells, clubs, maces, ropes \u2013 they all work.\nMake them work for \n.\n11: Reset and Reconnect\nMany have noted before us: modern humans are overworking themselves on a daily basis (in some Asian countries, unfortunately, they are overworking themselves to death even).\nThe question is \u2013 and, please, allow us to sound Shakespearean for a second \u2013 \n?\nWe\u2019ve developed so many machines and tools that are actually marketed as timesaving; then why, oh why, do we lack the time for our lovers and families, for our children and our hobbies, for our dogs and our daydreaming?\nAs far as Marcus Aubrey (and any sane person) is concerned the above is merely a rhetorical question.\nIn other words: stop working so much.\nWhen you come home from work, \n home: leave your computer in the beg, put your phone to the charger and start connecting with your life.\nQuiet down your brain with a puff of cannabis or a glass of wine and don\u2019t hesitate to pick up an instrument and learn how to play one.\nAlso \u2013 have a laugh with your loved ones.\n\u201cIf you spend a day without laughter and a smile, you haven\u2019t owned the day. Because there is no destination in a well-lived life, there is only the journey.\u201d\n12: Eat Dinner Like a King\nAnd after you\u2019re done resetting and reconnecting to your life, it\u2019s time to enjoy it a bit.\n\u201cAfter any good battle,\u201d writes Aubrey smartly, \u201cthe warrior looks forward to a feast. And that feast is dinner.\u201d\n\u201cGo ahead, champ, eat up and enjoy,\u201d he goes on. \u201cThe day is not won quite yet, but you deserve this meal. Break bread, grab some popcorn, eat some chocolate and enjoy. You deserve it not just because you worked for it \u2013 but because food is a great part of life. If you go a little too far, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got your back.\u201d\n\u201cEat it consciously, digest it well, and prime yourself for the best kind of dessert: sex.\u201d\n13: More, Better Sex\nSpeaking of\u2026\n\u201cWanting more sex than we normally have is part of the natural order,\u201d writes Aubrey Marcus. \u201cIt\u2019s when we start having less sex than we normally should, which we\u2019re seeing now, that things really start to go sideways.\u201d\nAnd, in a way, they have already broken down.\nThe world is just too much frustrated and, apparently, even millennials (at the height of their sexual drive) are having sex less and less often.\nWhy is that?\nPornography, for one thing.\nIt\u2019s not that you shouldn\u2019t indulge in it from time to time \u2013 sex is good even when it is with yourself \u2013 but, let\u2019s face it, it is not nearly as good as the real thing.\nAnd the real thing shouldn\u2019t be a substitute for the fake one: it should be the other way around.\nSo, start talking to your partner about likes and dislikes and try to rekindle the passion from the past \u2013 or create a new one if you\u2019d prefer.\nThen start exploring everything sex-related and be as adventurous as you and your partner would like. Spice things up and never forget that \u201cattraction begins with the nose, so be careful with masking your natural smells and pheromones.\u201d\nThat is \u2013 unless you need to.\n14: Turn Off, Tune In\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t turn off,\u201d writes Aubrey Marcus in yet another memorable aphorism, \u201cyou won\u2019t ever properly turn on.\u201d\nOf course, he refers to the most addictive extension of your existence \u2013 it is not coffee, alcohol or marijuana, but (you\u2019ve guessed it) the smartphone.\nWe know it\u2019s difficult, but, boy, is unplugging your phone at night necessary for your wellbeing. Time moves fast as it is and it moves even faster when you\u2019re endlessly scrolling down on Facebook.\nSo, why don\u2019t you stop doing that?\nStart a journal or something and spend the last half an hour of your day cuddling with the one you love.\nThat makes all the difference.\nFor one, you\u2019ll fall asleep much more easily; and you\u2019ll probably wake up feeling much more relaxed.\n15: Sleep\nWe are so sleep-deprived nowadays that Arianna Huffington basically changed careers to instigate a \n.\nAnd she has every right to do that because sleep is so important that it can either make or break you.\nAs we pointed out above \u2013 in the summary of the previous chapter \u2013 sleeping is all about finding a way to turn \n off for a few hours.\nAnd just like you need to keep interferences to a bare minimum to work more efficiently, you need to eliminate distractions if you\u2019d like to have a better sleep.\nThis means: a relaxation pre-sleep period within a cool and completely dark room; in other words: no blue lights whatsoever!\nAnd that\u2019s an order!\n16: Bring It Home\nChanging your daily routine \u2013 \n \u2013 means changing your life as well.\nOf course, not being able to do this in a short period of time doesn\u2019t mean the opposite: building a routine is difficult, and you need to learn how to forgive yourself if you don\u2019t want to give up.\n\u201cPerfection is a myth,\u201d reminds us Marcus Aubrey. \u201cIf you forgive yourself, you will begin to feel that you deserve to change for the better, and so you will.\u201d\nWhen in doubt, there are two ways to overcome the struggles: positive self-talk and friendship.\nConsequently, the best way to start creating a personal ethos for success includes not only the decision when to start but also the act of letting everyone you love know about it, asking for their unconditional support beforehand.\nThat\u2019s it.\nNow, do it.\nKey Lessons from \u201cOwn the Day, Own Your Life\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If You Don\u2019t Eat Fat, You\u2019re Probably Fat\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Listen to Your Body: Take Post-Lunch Power Naps to Boost Your Productivity\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Boost Your Testosterone Levels for Better Sex\nIf You Don\u2019t Eat Fat, You\u2019re Probably Fat\nOK, we admit that sounds counterintuitive on so many levels, but Marcus Aubrey\u2019s almost photoshopped body is evidence enough that it might just be true.\nIn his opinion, breakfast is not the most important meal of the day if it consists of carbohydrates and sugars; it is far, far better to not eat anything and fast for a few hours than eat cereals in the morning.\n\u201cTo restore metabolic health and optimize weight management,\u201d he advises, \u201cadding dietary fat back into the diet, starting with breakfast, is essential.\u201d\nListen to Your Body: Take Post-Lunch Power Naps to Boost Your Productivity\nEverybody has it: the urge to fall asleep right there on the work desk after that eagerly awaited lunch break.\nNow, most books offer advices on how to struggle through it; Marcus Aubrey says otherwise: just go with it.\nA 30-minute power nap in the middle of the day resets your body\u2019s energy and your mental capacity to just about the appropriate levels.\nFighting it does nobody any good: not you, not your boss, not your company.\nSo, workers of the world, unite: ask your CEOs to institute an obligatory 30-minute nap period after the lunch break.\nYour main argument: you\u2019ll make up for it.\nBoost Your Testosterone Levels for Better Sex\nMany studies have shown that regular sex might be just as good for you as a proper diet: in addition to being one of the most pleasurable activities out there, it also improves your health and your physique.\nIf you want to have more of it \u2013 then you need three things: 1) a partner you\u2019re attracted to; 2) a little quality time with him/her; and 3) a high-fat diet.\nYup \u2013 you\u2019ve heard it right: once again, fat is the key.\nWhy?\nBecause saturated fats and cholesterol are necessary to produce testosterone and testosterone ramps up your sex drive.\nSay no more: dear avocados, dear nuts, dear oily wild salmon \u2013 here we come!\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cOwn the Day, Own Your Life Quotes\u201d\nFinal Notes\nmay not offer many new things on the table, but it works great as a compilation for \u201ctotal human optimization.\u201d\nIn other words, instead of buying separate books on improving diet, health, exercise, and sex life \u2013 you can just buy this one.\nIt really works as a well-structured anthology of digested versions of many other books.\nAnd that is a compliment."},

And Why?\nis a book which everyone who thinks that life is slipping out of his/her control should read. \nThough, essentially, a philosophical book, it is one which deals with practical wisdom primarily, and, thus, abounds with many real-world examples (some of which taken straight from Pigliucci\u2019s life) which demonstrate how the philosophy of Stoicism should be applied in practice.\nAnd to paraphrase Marx \u2013 enough with philosophers trying to interpret our lives in various ways; the point is to change them.\nWell, that\u2019s this book\u2019s very objective.\nAbout Massimo Pigliucci\n is a philosopher of science and evolutionary biologist by trade, and secular humanist, scientific skeptic and Stoic by beliefs. \nProfessor of Philosophy at CUNY-City College, Pigliucci is primarily known for his outspoken views regarding pseudoscience and creationism, especially through his \n.\nA regular writer for \n,\nlong-time blogger at \n, and author of numerous books, Pigliucci is one of the most famous modern Stoics today.\nFind out more at \n. \n\u201cHow to Be a Stoic PDF Summary\u201d\nStoicism 101: A Very Basic Introduction\n\u201cIn every culture we know of, whether it be secular or religious, ethnically diverse or not,\u201d writes Massimo Pigliucci at the beginning of \n,\n\u201cthe question of how to live is central.\u201d\nAnd the question of how to live is always more than a simple one, encompassing at least three more: \u201cHow should we handle life\u2019s challenges and vicissitudes? How should we conduct ourselves in the world and treat others? And the ultimate question: how do we best prepare for the final test of our character, the moment when we die?\u201d\nAs far as Pigliucci is concerned, the philosophy that gives the best answer to these questions is Stoicism.\nHowever, Stoicism is not all about keeping a stiff upper lip and suppressing your emotions, aka being a modern (or, to be more exact, an old-fashioned) Mr. Spock.\nIn fact, it is the other way around:\nPigliucci\u2019s book, however, isn\u2019t interested in merely dispelling these myths and unearthing other common misconceptions.\nIt is, on the contrary, a practical one, a book interested in teaching you how you can live a better life.\nBut, before that \u2013 says Pigliucci \u2013 a little road map of the journey, because it is always good to know where you\u2019re going and where you shouldn\u2019t go, and understand the context for all things you\u2019d be experiencing during the journey.\nThat\u2019s why, in the second chapter of \n,\nPigliucci takes a closer look at the history of Stoicism.\nHere it is summarized.\nSo, the philosophy began around the year 300 BC with a guy named Zeno, who picked up most of his beliefs and understandings of the world from a philosopher named Crates, after surviving a shipwreck.\nNow, Zeno taught his students at the Stoa Poikile \u2013 or \u201cThe Painted Porch\u201d (a public place in the center of the city) \u2013 and this is why his philosophy and its followers were subsequently known as Stoicism and Stoics.\nFor the next century and a half, Stoicism was just one of the many philosophical schools interested in the practical application of philosophy (the other being the Peripatetics, the Cynics, the Epicureans, the Cyrenaics, the Academics, the Skeptics), but then in 155 BC, something very important happened.\nNamely, the heads of the Stoa at the time (Diogenes of Babylon), the Academy, and the Peripatetic school were all chosen as ambassadors to represent Athens in political negotiations with the Roman Empire.\nIn time, Rome did conquer Athens in military manners, but politically and philosophically, this visit changed Rome forever.\nThe visit itself was enough to start the period of the Middle Stoa which, after Rome became the largest empire ever seen, evolved in the Late Stoa, represented by the four best-known Stoics: Musonius Rufus, Seneca, Epictetus, and \n.\nWith the advent of Christianity, Stoicism was basically dead for millennia; fortunately, modern authors (such as Pigliucci) have resurrected it from its ashes.\nPart I. The Discipline of Desire: What It Is Proper to Want or Not to Want\nThe three parts of Pigliucci\u2019s book consist of four chapters each.\nThe first one covers the basics as far as disciplining the desire is concerned: the dichotomy of control (\u201cChapter 3: Some Things Are in Our Power, Others Are Not\u201d), living according to nature (that\u2019s the title of Chapter 4), choosing virtue over comfort and wealth (\u201cChapter 5: Playing Ball with Socrates\u201d), and the existence of God (\u201cChapter 6: God or Atoms?\u201d).\nThis is the central tenet of the philosophy of Stoicism and is not at all surprising that Ryan Holiday\u2019s \nbegins with Epictetus\u2019 formulation of it.\nHere\u2019s another one, quoted by Pigliucci:\nThis is the great rule-of-thumb when it comes to making ethical decisions the Stoic way: just ask yourself what you can control and what you cannot.\nFor example, you can\u2019t control the weather, and no matter how much you want to play soccer you\u2019re your friends, you can\u2019t make it \u201cunrain.\u201d \nWhat you can do, however, is switch to another game which includes your friends. So, what\u2019s it gonna be: anger and no soccer or a touch of bargained joy and a game of monopoly?\nYeah, we thought so too.\nBut this is applicable on many other occasions.\nJust take Pigliucci himself.\nHe wasn\u2019t happy with his body a while ago, so instead of wallowing in the mire, one day, he asked Epictetus what to do, and decided to do what he \ndo: eat less and healthier, exercise more regularly, and drop the unhealthy habits.\nThe result?\nWell, he achieved a better physique.\nHowever, he didn\u2019t get exactly the body he wanted to (a slim, muscular one), because, well, genes. \nAnd \nhe accepted. \nAfter all, he didn\u2019t have any other choice.\nNow, let us go even further than the example above \u2013 with another one, straight from the life of none other than Socrates.\nAs you know full well \u2013 not in the least because we\u2019ve summarized two relevant books on the subject (Plato\u2019s \nand \n) \u2013 Socrates was not only tried for his teachings by the Athenian court but was also judged guilty in the end. \nHowever, because he was well loved by quite a few guys with good connections \u2013 and because his prison guards were not unlike the prison guards of today (aka, \n) \u2013 Socrates had an easy opportunity to escape just a day before his death sentence.\nHowever, as we learn from Plato\u2019s \n(remind us to summarize that one as well), Socrates chose not to.\nHis explanation?\nNothing matters more than integrity \u2013 not friends, family, children, or even one\u2019s own life.\nIn other words, Socrates knew that it was his moral duty to accept the law even when it is patently misused, \u201cbecause we don\u2019t get to change the rules when they happen not to suit us.\u201d\nHe spent his whole life telling others that they must adhere to the law no matter what \u2013 and he should be the first one not allowed to be exempt from this rule.\nJust like Socrates, we\u2019re given with a certain amount of marbles; we can try to multiply them or keep them and use them till they run out. But we cannot change the fact that there are marbles in the game.\nPigliucci realized this himself after hearing that his bank is dealing with some shady businesses; even though, if it is up to him, there should be no banks whatsoever, that\u2019s not something that he can change.\nThe only thing he \n do, however, was to switch banks.\nPart II. The Discipline of Action: How to Behave in The World\nThe four chapters in Part II of \ndeal with character and virtue (\u201cChapter 7: It\u2019s All About Character (and Virtue)\u201d), evil and ignorance (\u201cChapter 8: A Very Crucial Word\u201d), role models (\u201cChapter 9: The Role of Role Models\u201d) and disability and mental illness (the title of Chapter 10).\nAs Pigliucci informs us, \u201cthe Stoics adopted Socrates\u2019s classification of four aspects of virtue, which they thought of as four tightly interlinked character traits: (practical) wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice.\u201d\nThe most important among this is, of course, the first one: (practical) wisdom. And there\u2019s a pretty simple reason for this: it is the mechanism which allows you to practice the dichotomy of control, making humans the only species known capable of doing this.\nPut simply, \n, because, as many examples show, you can be happy regardless of your conditions.\nThough courage can be understood as a physical trait, the Stoics meant a more ethical category, for example, the ability to act well under challenging circumstances (such as, say, \n).\nTemperance is what makes it possible for us to \u201ccontrol our desires and actions so that we don\u2019t yield to excesses,\u201d the archenemy of \n (aka, the ethically good life).\nFinally, justice \u201crefers not to an abstract theory of how society should be run, but rather to the practice of treating other human beings with dignity and fairness.\u201d\nThis is, perhaps, the strangest aspect of Stoic philosophy: most sociologists and educators today say that you \n have role models because they might hinder your development as a unique human being.\nHowever, having a role model is basically like \n having a name to fill the blank in the all-important ethical question: \u201cWhat would ______________ if he were in my position?\u201d\nFor \n, for example, the guy most suited to fill in the blank was none other than Marcus Cato, known as Cato the Younger.\nA stubborn statesman immune to bribes, to Seneca, Cato was an embodiment of the virtuous life.\nWhen he was a military commander, Cato slept and ate alongside his soldiers who, expectedly, loved him because of this. When he was a tax collector for Cyprus, he dutifully collected taxes and didn\u2019t use the opportunity to enrich himself.\nWhen Caesar attempted to seize control, Cato fought him to defend the Republic; and when he lost, he decided to commit suicide rather than be captured.\nOn top of it, his suicide (piercing his stomach with a dagger) didn\u2019t pan out perfectly, so Cato\u2019s shriek alarmed the servants and the physicians.\n\u201cThe physician went to him,\u201d informs us Plutarch, \u201cand would have put in his bowels, which were not pierced, and sewed up the wound; but Cato, recovering himself, and understanding the intention, thrust away the physician, plucked out his own bowels, and tearing open the wound, immediately expired.\u201d\nNow, that\u2019s gory.\nIt\u2019s also incredibly demanding, courageous and ethically almost otherworldly.\nOf course, most people never have to face situations such as these, but having Cato as a role model helps throughout.\nAfter all, standing up to your boss doesn\u2019t look like something \n demanding in view of Cato\u2019s suicide, does it?\nPart III. The Discipline of Assent: How to React to Situations\nSpeaking of death and suicide, the final part of Pigliucci\u2019s book begins with an exploration of it (Chapter 11), before analyzing how to deal with anger, anxiety, and loneliness (Chapter 12) and moving on to topics such as love and friendship (Chapter 13) and practical spiritual exercises (the final, Chapter 14).\nAs you can see from the example of Cato \u2013 and Seneca using him as a role model \u2013 the ancient Stoics were very concerned with death.\nActually, writes Pigliucci, \u201c\u2019concerned\u2019 is precisely the wrong word. They were aware of death and of the importance that human beings attach to it, but they developed a very unusual and empowering view of it.\u201d\nAnd you can sense a lot of it from this passage taken straight from Epictetus\u2019 \n (II.6):\nIn other words, dying is part of life and, no matter what you do (\n), you, and all the people you know, will one day die.\nAccept that and fill the rest of your life with simple pleasures; because no matter how angry or stressed you are about death \u2013 it will happen.\nSo, why worries?\nUnlike us who most of the time distinguish between friends and enemies, the Greek \u2013 from Aristotle onward \u2013 distinguished between at least three types of friendships: friendship of utility, friendship of pleasure, and friendship of the good.\nA friendship of utility is \u2013 to quote Pigliucci \u2013 \u201cwhat we nowadays would call an acquaintance based on reciprocal advantage.\u201d Think of your favorite hairdresser as a good example: it\u2019s not like you call him/her once or twice a week, but it\u2019s not like you don\u2019t enjoy visiting him/her either.\nA friendship of pleasure is once again based on a reciprocal relationship, but this time it is not utilitarian: the commodity which binds these friendships together is pleasure. The guys you play soccer with serve as a good example: most of them you only call when you arrange a game. And they come \u2013 because they enjoy playing soccer just like you do.\nFinally, a friendship of the good, \u201cthat rare phenomenon when two people enjoy each other for their own sake because they find in each other an affinity of character that does not require externalities like a business exchange or a hobby.\u201d\nNow, as far as the Stoics were concerned, the only friendships worth pursuing are the last ones. \nIt doesn\u2019t mean that the other two don\u2019t matter (on the contrary, in fact), but they are not about the people as much as they are about the commodities. Go bald or start playing basketball, and they\u2019ll break up.\nThe real friends, however, remain until the very end. They are not the guys or girls you talk to about celebrities or sex scandals, but the ones you tell your most na\u00efve dreams and worst nightmares.\nDo you have someone like that in your life?\nHold onto them.\nThat\u2019s what Epictetus and \n advise.\nKey Lessons from \u201cHow to Be a Stoic\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Serenity Prayer Is Stoicism 101\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Learn How to Play Ball with Socrates\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raging or Not, You\u2019ll Die Either Way: Make the Most of Your Life\nThe Serenity Prayer Is Stoicism 101\nPigliucci happened upon it for the first time in Vonnegut\u2019s \n, but you probably know it from every second movie or TV show: the Serenity Prayer.\nIt goes like this: \u201cGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,/ Courage to change the things I can,/ And wisdom to know the difference.\u201d\nIn this modern form, the prayer was canonized by the American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, but you can find it among ancient Judaist and Buddhist scholars as well.\nThe most ancient version, however, is probably found in Epictetus\u2019 \n (or \n), right at the beginning.\nIt forms the basis of Stoic philosophy, advising you to worry \nabout the things you can change, and let the others be \n you can\u2019t change them.\nLearn How to Play Ball with Socrates\nNow Epictetus \u2013 though he started out as a slave \u2013 was a fairly smart guy. Unsurprisingly, he often mentioned another smart guy in his writings, his role model, Socrates.\nSocrates, he wrote at one place, \u201cwas like one playing at ball. What then was the ball that he played with? Life, imprisonment, exile, taking poison, being deprived of his wife, leaving his children orphans. These were the things he played with, but none the less he played and tossed the ball with balance.\u201d\n\u201cSo,\u201d he concluded, \u201cwe ought to play the game, so to speak, with all possible care and skill, but treat the ball itself as indifferent.\u201d\nWait\u2026 \nPigliucci has an excellent explanation.\nRaging or Not, You\u2019ll Die Either Way: Make the Most of Your Life\n\u201cI must die, must I?\u201d wrote Epictetus at the beginning of his \n.\n\u201cIf at once, then I am dying: if soon, I dine now, as it is time for dinner, and afterward when the time comes, I will die.\u201d\nMay you always boast of this kind of serenity before death. \nIt is, to say the least, admirable. \nBut, once you think about it, it is also \nas well.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cHow to Be a Stoic Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nEven though we\u2019re are aware that books such as William B.

And Why?\nIf you\u2019ve ever read anything by Joan Didion, you already know that she is \u2013 as a \n review once noted \u2013 not only a good novelist but one of USA\u2019s greatest essayists.\nWell, this book is a collection of notes which never got to become essays; but the writing still has the same power, sharpness, and beauty.\nIn addition to being a Joan Didion book, there\u2019s another reason why you should read \n: in retrospect, her observances of the South seem prophetic.\nRead more carefully, and you\u2019ll see Trump\u2019s name written over some of these pages \u2013 even though they date from the 1970s.\nAbout Joan Didion\n is an American journalist, novelist, and essayist.\nWidely admired for her writing style and her capability to portray the disintegration of American morals and the social fragmentation of the USA, Didion is often considered one of the most prominent voices in the New Journalism literary movement.\nWinner of the National Book Award for Nonfiction for her autobiography \n, Didion is the author of six novels and as many screenplays, a play, and about a dozen nonfiction works.\n\u201cSouth and West PDF Summary\u201d\n as \u201ca scrapbook of background notes, thoughts and early drafts by one of the most extraordinary writers of our time,\u201d Joan Didion\u2019s \n, for the most part, looks like a book that never should have been written.\nAnd, in a way, it never was: comprising two sections \u2013 the substantial \u201cNotes on the South\u201d and the pretty brief, even less structured, and no more than trivial \u201cCalifornia Notes\u201d \u2013 the book is nothing more but a string of beginnings no middle and an end, sort of would-be essays, if you please.\nAnd they all date back to the 1970s, the second part being peculiarly and almost anachronistically topical, covering (mostly) the abduction of Patty Hearst by the Symbionese Liberation Army.\nThen why should these notes be published at all?\n\u201cNo doubt Didion has now decided to publish \n,\u201d wrote Michiko Kakutani in her review for \n,\nbecause they similarly shed light on the current political moment. At a remove of more than four decades, she maps the divisions splintering America today, and uncannily anticipates some of the dynamics that led to the election of Donald J. Trump and caught so many political and media insiders unawares.\u201d\nIn other words, the ever-intuitive brilliant mind of perhaps the greatest modern American essayist felt, back in the 1970s, that the American story most of the other people believed in is not the whole story.\nAnd feared that, one day, the untold parts of it would feel like a twist.\n is proof that they shouldn\u2019t.\nCalifornia and the South\nAt first glance, even the arrangement of the book seems strange: why should Didion\u2019s \u201cNotes on the South\u201d from her 1970 notebooks be paired with her \u201cCalifornia Notes\u201d from six years later? \nAren\u2019t the two incompatible on so many levels?\nWell, in a way, that is exactly the reason why Didion grouped these two selections.\n\u201cI had a theory that if I could understand the South,\u201d she explained her decision to the \n in 2006, \u201cI would understand something about California because a lot of the California settlers came from the Border South.\u201d \n\u201cIt is a counterintuitive theory,\u201d writes Nathaniel Rich in the \u201cForeword\u201d to \n, \u201cfor the South and the West represent the poles of the American experience \u2013 the South drowning in its past, the West looking ahead to distant frontiers in a spirit of earnest, eternal optimism.\u201d\n\u201cThe future always looks good in the golden land,\u201d wrote Didion in \n, \u201cbecause no one remembers the past.\u201d \n\u201cIn the South, no one can forget it,\u201d adds Rich.\nAlmost impossible to be summarized \u2013 after all, it is a string of purposefully unstructured notes \u2013 \nchronicles traces and window-glances of two Didion\u2019s trips.\nThe first one is a tour Didion and her husband John took of the Gulf South for a month in the summer of 1970, making notes and recording conversations for a future piece \u2013 one that would never be completed. \nThe second part records some notes of a visit to San Francisco in 1976, paid by the \nmagazine so that Joan Didion can provide them with an account of the trial of Patty Hearst.\n, this one too gives birth to something better.\nNotes on the South\n\u201cI could never precisely name what impelled me to spend time in the South during the summer of 1970,\u201d writes Joan Didion in one of the first notes from the first part of \n. \n\u201cThere was no reportorial imperative to any of the places I went at the time I went: nothing \u2018happened\u2019 anywhere I was, no celebrated murders, trials, integration orders, confrontations, not even any celebrated acts of God.\u201d\nBut what she writes next strikes with prophetical fervor:\n\u201cAnd so,\u201d Didion goes on, \u201cinstead of talking about it I flew south one day in the summer of 1970, rented a car, and drove for a month or so around Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama, saw no spokesmen, covered no events, did nothing at all but try to find out, as usual, what was making the picture in my mind.\u201d\nThe notes \u2013 some longer, some brief \u2013 chronicle Didion\u2019s travels from New Orleans and Biloxi, Mississippi, to Meridian, Mississippi, and Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and, finally, into Faulkner\u2019s hometown, Oxford.\nDidion\u2019s first note opens with an anthologically beautiful paragraph:\n\u201cIn New Orleans,\u201d Didion writes in another note, \u201cthey have mastered the art of the motionless.\u201d\nOne afternoon on St. Charles Avenue, Joan witnesses the death of a woman, falling forward over the wheel of her car.\nWhat strikes Didion most is the fact that not many people consider this death a special event. \n\u201cDead,\u201d says an old woman upon seeing the body and, afterward, when asked by a waitress whose fault it was, says that it\u2019s nobody\u2019s.\nAnd then, suddenly, the two start talking about the weather, noting how incredibly hot it is.\n\u201cThe death had seemed serious but casual,\u201d notes Didion, \u201cas if it had taken place in a pre-Columbian city where death was expected and did not in the long run count for much.\u201d\nIn a brilliant study of the American South nowadays \u2013 aptly titled \n \u2013 Arlie Russell Hochschild reveals why most of \n are radically Republican and why they don\u2019t intend to change this.\nHalf a century before, Joan Didion got a glimpse of this and penned it down in a few notes which kind of tell the same story from the other side: just as to a Louisianan, a Californian may seem a natural enemy who understands nothing about reality, to a Californian, being in New Orleans, may seem as if he/she\u2019s visiting another country.\nAnd here\u2019s a simple note which demonstrates this.\nSince Didion falls and hurts a rib in New Orleans, she decides to see a doctor in Meridian. She goes to the Rush Foundation Hospital (where all doctors are members of the Rush family), and, while waiting, starts seeing the world through \n eyes:\nAnd it gets even worse than that.\nWhen asked if she is traveling alone, Joan Didion says she\u2019s traveling with her husband, but she\u2019s not wearing her wedding ring.\nA long pause follows.\n\u201cThe past is never dead \u2013 it\u2019s not even past,\u201d wrote the South\u2019s greatest writer, William Faulkner, in his 1951 novel \n.\nAnyone who has ever visited the red-state counties on the American South knows exactly what that means.\nBut very few would ever be able to put it into words better than Didion:\n\u201cThe time warp: the Civil War was yesterday, but 1960 is spoken of as if it were about three hundred years ago.\u201d\nBear in mind that Didion is writing about the 1970s, the years after the Civil Rights Movement, and the years when it seems America is finally becoming America for all Americans.\nHowever, Didion doesn\u2019t feel this; on the contrary: it feels as if the South is buried deep into the past, with most of the people she overhears speaking nostalgically about things such as cheap labor and racism.\nAnd why is that?\nOne word: isolation.\n\u201cThe isolation of these people from the currents of American life in 1970 was startling and bewildering to behold,\u201d writes Didion. \u201cAll their information was fifth-hand and mythicized in the handing down. Does it matter where Taos is, after all, if Taos is not in Mississippi?\u201d\nHas something changed 50 years later?\nOf course not!\n\u201cReaders today will recognize,\u201d writes Nathaniel Rich in the Foreword, \u201cwith some dismay and even horror, how much is familiar in these long-lost American portraits. Didion saw her era more clearly than anyone else, which is another way of saying that she was able to see the future.\u201d\nIn other words, Didion\u2019s intuition wasn\u2019t far off: the South wasn\u2019t the past but the future.\nAnd the election of Trump and the era of fake news \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 proved her more than right.\nCalifornia Notes\nMove along \u2013 not much to see here.\n\u201cCalifornia Notes\u201d\n(which you can read in their entirety \n) started with Joan Didion telling Jann Wenner of \n that she\u2019s interested in covering the Patty Hearst trial.\nNo need to go into the trial in detail, because the notes barely even mention it.\nAnd you already know the main facts: in 1974, William Randolph Heart\u2019s (aka Citizen Kane\u2019s) granddaughter Patty was kidnapped by the far-left Symbionese Liberation Army and, in the most famous Stockholm syndrome twist in history, two months later, decided to change her name to Tania and start robbing with the SLA; she was caught a year and a half later.\nJoan Didion went to San Francisco to follow the trial, but this pushed her into examining her thoughts about California.\nThey did evolve into something in the end \u2013 but not an article on Patty Hearst: though published in 2003, Didion\u2019s book \n is the final result of her 1976 trip to San Francisco.\nAnd these notes, for the most part, seem as if the few that didn\u2019t make it there \u2013 most of them being about Didion reading Gertrude Atherton than anything else.\nKey Lessons from \u201cSouth and West\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Isolation Breeds Fifth-Hand News and Alternate Facts\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The South and the West | The Past and the Future\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We May Be Through with the Past, But the Past Ain\u2019t Through with Us\nIsolation Breeds Fifth-Hand News and Alternate Facts\nThough Joan Didion visited the South half a century ago, she did notice something the consequences of which we notice only today: \u201call their information was fifth-hand, and mythicized in the handing down.\u201d\nIn other words, Didion observed (that what we now consider) fake news is not a new phenomenon, but a way of life for America\u2019s Southerners, going all the way back to the tall tales of the 19\n century.\nAfter all, someone who has no present has no option but to feed his/her imagination on myths.\nThe South and the West | The Past and the Future\nWe chose to separate the two in the title with a vertical bar mainly because we didn\u2019t know how. \nEven though at first glance it may seem that the South (New Orleans) represents the past and the West (California) the future of the United States, Didion had some doubts about this already in the 1970s.\nIn fact, as she hints in the very first notes, she had some strange feeling that it might be the other way around.\nBack then, probably nobody would have believed her.\nAnd then Trump got elected \u2013 and now she\u2019s thought of as a prophet.\nWe May Be Through with the Past, But the Past Ain\u2019t Through with Us\nThat\u2019s a quote taken directly from Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \nWe don\u2019t really know the exact origin of it \u2013 believe us, we\u2019ve tried finding it \u2013 but, in a way, it\u2019s a variation (and an update) on William Faulkner\u2019s famous \u201cthe past is never dead; it\u2019s not even past.\u201d\nWe won\u2019t delve more deeply into these quotes, but we would say that they seem like the best lesson one should take away from Joan Didion\u2019s 1970 notes on the South.\nTake that to mean whatever you want it to mean.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cSouth and West Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nDubbed \u201cone of the best books of the year\u201d by both the NPR and the \n, \n is an exceptional book, not the least because it doesn\u2019t even try to be one, being just a string of unstructured and barely connected notes from two trips of the 1970s.\nDidion\u2019s notes, however \u2013 as Nathaniel Rich notes \u2013 \u201csurpass in elegance and clarity the finished prose of most other writers\u201d and \u201care a fascinating record of [the] time.\u201d\nEven more, they are an unsettling look into our present and, perhaps, even our future."},

And Why?\nHave you ever watched \n? \nOr, at least, those wonderful and wonderfully funny \n? \nIf the answer is \u201cno\u201d to both questions, be aware that you need no more than a few minutes to watch the latter. And you \n \u2013 because then you\u2019ll know much better what this book is about: the power of language to influence worldviews.\nA recommended read for anyone even vaguely interested in language and/or our capability to learn and use one: in one sentence, there are few better introductions to linguistic relativity and related topics than Guy Deutscher\u2019s \n.\nThrough the Language Glass Summary\nPart I: The Language Mirror\nIf you know a thing or two about British history, then the name of William Ewart Gladstone would certainly mean something to you.\nAfter all, the guy was UK\u2019s Prime Minister for 12 years in the 19\n century!\nBut that\u2019s not why Deutscher spends a large part of the first chapter of \ntalking about him.\nYou see, while out of office, Gladstone devoted \u201chis legendary energies to the realm of the mind, and in particular to his burning intellectual passion\u201d Homer.\nAnd ten years before he became Prime Minister for the first time, Gladstone published a book now read almost exclusively by classicists and linguists: \n.\nWhy linguists?\nWell, because in it, there\u2019s a chapter whose content is even more interesting than its title: \u201cHomer\u2019s Perception and Use of Color.\u201d\nGladstone\u2019s analysis of Homer\u2019s epics \u2013 the \n and the \n, of course \u2013 \u201crevealed that there is something awry about Homer\u2019s descriptions of color.\u201d\nWhat?\nWell, this:\n#1. Homer often uses the same word to denote colors which, according to us, are essentially different; for example, both the sea and the oxen are described as having the appearance of wine.\n#2. Homer often describes the same object with incompatible color terms: iron can be violet, gray, and horse-colored.\n#3. Homer\u2019s epics are remarkably colorless: e.g., he not once uses the color \u201cblue\u201d even when describing the sky and the sea; \n#4. On the other hand, he uses the colors \u201cblack\u201d and \u201cwhite\u201d almost constantly: they appear 170 and 100 times in the epics; for comparison, the next more prominent color is red: 13 times;\n#5. All in all, Homer\u2019s color vocabulary is very small.\nWhy?\nNo other explanation than this: the Greeks didn\u2019t see colors the way we do.\nEven if you knew Gladstone, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve probably never heard of Lazarus Geiger, a German Jewish philosopher and philologist.\nAnd that\u2019s too bad, because, according to Brent Berlin and Paul Key, he was the guy \u201cwho first detected universal sequence in the acquisition of basic color terms.\u201d\nBasically, what he did is he started out where Gladstone left off, asking himself whether the Greeks using so few words for colors were an exception or a rule as far as ancient civilizations were concerned.\nIt turned out that it isn\u2019t only Homer, but also the Bible and the Indian Vedas that treat color strangely \u2013 at least in relation to modern standards.\nFor one, neither the Vedas nor the Old Testament \u2013 just like all Homer \u2013 \ndescribe the sky as being blue.\nIn September 1867, in his hometown of Frankfurt-at-Mein, Geiger opened his lecture in which he shared his findings with two thought-provoking questions:\n\u201cHas human sensation, has perception by the senses, a history? Did everything in the human sense organs thousands of years ago function exactly as it does now, or can we perhaps show that at some remote period these organs must have been partly incapable of their present performance?\u201d\nNow, though initially dismissive of Gladstone and Geiger, many people \u2013 especially after Lamarck and Darwin \u2013 during the late 19\n century, started interpreting these questions as rhetorical.\nSimply put, the eyes of the ancients weren\u2019t as developed as our eyes today: they saw \ncolors just like, say, dogs do.\nThere\u2019s only one problem with this.\nHow can we know what they \n saw?\nFor example, the Ancient Mycenaeans adored the lapis lazuli. Why would they if they hadn\u2019t been able to \n the color blue?\nCould it be that they simply didn\u2019t have a word for it?\n\u201cTo most people who have heard of him,\u201d writes Deutscher, \u201cW. H. R. Rivers is the compassionate psychiatrist who treated Siegfried Sassoon during World War I.\u201d\nTo linguists, however, he is one of the guys who proved the evolutionists wrong and the culturalists right \u2013 when it comes to color perception, that is.\nIt all happened just at the turn of the centuries.\nIn 1898, W. H. R. Rivers set off on a journey to the northern tip of the Great Barrier Reef and had a word or two with the so-called Torres Straits Islanders.\nWhat he discovered (mostly) boils down to this: the Islanders were pretty capable of discerning colors, but their language lacked words to pin down this perceptual capability.\nFor example, when asked to choose similarly colored wool pieces from a range of differently colored wool, the Islanders were just as good as the Europeans in choosing the right pieces (this is, by the way, called the Holmgren wool test).\nHowever, when asked to describe these colors, they used the same words: for example, the word for the color red (\n), derived from the word for blood (\n) was also used for pink and brown.\n\u201cRivers\u2019 meticulous experiments,\u201d writes Deutscher, \u201cthus demonstrated beyond any possible doubt that people can see the differences between all imaginable shades of colors and yet have no standard names in their language even for basic colors such as green or blue.\u201d \nHowever, this wasn\u2019t the only conclusion Rivers arrived at.\nInterestingly enough, the other questioned his previous findings \u2013 the ones explained above.\nYou see, just like Homer and Moses, for some reason, the Torres Straits Islanders did use the word \u201cblack\u201d to describe the perfectly blue sky.\nRivers couldn\u2019t understand this at all.\nAnd he basically just gave up there.\n\u201cOne cannot,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwholly ignore the fact that intelligent natives would regard it as perfectly natural to apply the same name to the brilliant blue of the sky and sea which they give to the deepest black.\u201d\nIt may seem strange at first, true, but it is not really difficult to explain this, says Deutscher.\nSimply put, the ancient civilizations saw these two colors as two different shades of the \n color.\nHere\u2019s an interesting thought experiment in counterfactual history for you to understand this.\nJust imagine the Russian anthropologist Yuri Magnovievitch Gladonov going on an expedition to the remote British Isles off the northern coast of Europe in the late 19\n century.\nWouldn\u2019t he be dumbfounded to find out that the British Islanders think that both the \n and \ncolors are just two shades of a single color?\nThey insist on calling both of them \u201cblue,\u201d even though they differ between them (and this is a scientific fact) as much as the colors green and blue!\nThe conclusion?\nThe color spectrum is a continuum; different cultures divide it differently; and for some, the chunks of this spectrum are bigger, so they see many colors that others see as different like different shades of the same color.\nThat\u2019s it.\nOr is it?\nIn addition to questioning the concept of a unified human color vision \u2013 across space and time \u2013 Geiger discovered something else as well.\nNamely, that almost all cultures developed color words in much the same order.\nFirst, they were aware of the difference between dark and bright, so the first two color words that appear anywhere are black and white; then followed a sensitivity to red, then yellow, then green, and finally violet and blue.\nNow, if this evolution is so universal, then at least some of it must be connected to our human nature.\nAnd in 1969, Brent Berlin and Paul Kay \u2013 in their book \n \u2013 demonstrated that this is \n true.\nIn other words, neither the culturalists nor the evolutionists were right \u2013 because neither of them was wrong to begin with.\nAnd the reason for this is quite simple.\n\u201cThe more decisive nature has been in staking out its boundaries,\u201d explains Deutscher, \u201cthe less leeway there is for culture\u2026 On the other hand, when nature has shown even the slightest dithering or fuzziness in marking its boundaries, different cultures have far more sway over the division of concepts than anyone exposed only to the conventions of one society would imagine.\u201d\nAnd unlike preexisting categories (such as dogs and birds and roses), colors are not strictly divided. \nIt is, in other words, pretty normal to expect from all languages to have different words for dogs and birds and roses, but it is not normal to expect from all of them to distinguish between blue and green and yellow.\nHowever, it is not strange that red is, universally, the first color to be named (that is, after black and white): it is the color of survival, the color of sex and blood.\nIt is, more or less, common knowledge that the more primitive a society is, the more primitive its language is.\nJust think of all those movies when a primitive man comes to life in a modern age or arrives in a \n.\nHis linguistic capabilities are childish, to say the least: \u201cme sleep here\u201d is the best he can utter for the most part of the movie.\nHowever, \u201cattempts to connect particular types of linguistic morphology with certain correlated stages of cultural development are vain,\u201d wrote Edward Sapir in \nin 1921, adding, quite casually, that \u201crightly understood, such correlations are rubbish.\u201d\nSimply put, all languages are, in one way or another, complex; it\u2019s just that complexity works in a different. \nJust think of it this way: the English language spoken by both the cops and the gangs in \n is equally complex but has developed in two parallel processes.\n\u201cWhen it comes to linguistic form,\u201d concluded Sapir, \u201cPlato walks with the Macedonian swineherd, Confucius with the head-hunting savage of Assam.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s even more interesting than this.\nA guy named Revere Perkins, in 1992, tried to test out the commonsense theory that more complex societies develop more complex languages.\nWhat he found out will probably surprise you: it is \u2013 prepare for it \u2013 \nIn other words, the more complex a society is, the simpler the word structure.\nWhy?\nBecause complex societies are more global and more connected to the world, so they often need to explain their own contexts to strangers; and strangers want simpler explanations.\nDon\u2019t believe us?\nThen, please do tell us, which language sounds to you simpler: Shakespearean English or Global English?\n\u00a0Yeah, we think so too.\nPart II: The Language Lens\nThe abovementioned Edward Sapir is probably one of the most famous linguists nowadays; unfortunately, it is mostly through a pseudoscientific theory \u2013 further developed by one of his students, Benjamin Whorf \u2013 now known (wrongly) as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.\nIn essence, the theory states that language categories either \n or \nand \ncognitive categories. \nSimply put, it means that you\u2019d grown up a different person if, say, you grew up in Germany and acquired the German language as your first one.\nIn a way, it makes sense: it\u2019s difficult to expect from a person whose language hasn\u2019t developed simple words for complex numbers to be a good mathematician; even more relatable: do you honestly believe that we\u2019d be as good at math as are if we still used Roman numbers to multiply and divide?\nHowever, even though popularized by many movies (\nbeing the most famous among them) and pseudoscientific Internet articles, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is, as much as it has been tested, decidedly wrong.\nEven Sapir knew this, suggesting that \u201cit would be na\u00efve to imagine that any analysis of experience is dependent on pattern expressed in language.\u201d\nAnd even though \n and Chomsky explicitly blame Whorf for unscientifically advocating linguistic determinism, it may be true that even he didn\u2019t believe it to the extent he is blamed for.\nAnyway, one thing isn\u2019t na\u00efve at all.\nTo phrase it the way Russian-American linguist Roman Jakobson did: \u201cLanguages differ essentially in what they \n convey and not in what they \n convey.\u201d\n\u201cThe crucial differences between languages, in other words,\u201d sums up Deutscher, \u201care not in what each language allows its speakers to express \u2013 for, in theory, any language could express anything \u2013 but in what information each language obliges it speakers to express.\u201d\nAnd the examples, please?\nWell, here\u2019s the first one.\nIt concerns spatial reality, and it deals primarily with the way the Aboriginal Guugu Yimithirr tribe of Far North Queensland see space and spatial relations.\nTo understand this better, first you need to understand the difference between relative egocentric and pure cardinal directions.\nRelative egocentric directions are the ones you use on a regular basis: left, right, forward, backward, up, and down. They are called egocentric because they depend on your position (\n means \u201cI\u201d in Latin); and that is the exact same reason why they are called relative: no absolute direction corresponds to any of these relative directions.\nPure cardinal directions, however, are absolute: they are the directions of north, east, south, and west. If you turn around what was to your left is suddenly located on your right, but the pure cardinal direction didn\u2019t change.\nAnd why are the Guugu Yimithirr people so strange?\nWell, because they use pure geographic directions instead of egocentric ones even when they\u2019re talking casually between them.\nFor example, \u201cif you are reading a book facing north, and a Guugu Yimithirr speaker wants to tell you to skip ahead, he will say, \u2018go further east,\u2019 because the pages are flipped from east to west.\u201d However, \u201cif you are looking at it facing south, the Guugu Yimithirr will, of course, say, \u2018go further west.\u2019\u201d\nYou wouldn\u2019t be able to make this distinction without a compass, which means that the worldview of the Guugu Yimithirr people \n \n determined by their language.\nThey sense the cardinal directions because their language obliges them to.\n\u201cGender,\u201d writes Deutscher, \u201cprovides our second example of how the mother tongue influences thought.\u201d\nOnce again, it is because in some languages you are obliged to specify the gender of all nouns, even though, most of them, don\u2019t have a natural gender by definition.\nThis results in some identifiably strange incidents.\nFor example, the Spanish word for \u201cbridge\u201d is \n and the German one is \n; you don\u2019t need to know a lot Spanish or German to understand that, as far as the Spanish are concerned, bridges are males and, as far as the Germans are asked, they are females.\nNothing strange so far: it\u2019s a convention, and, since bridges have no natural gender, words just developed that way.\nHowever, when Toshi Konishi asked both German and Spanish speakers to describe a bridge, he realized an interesting pattern: Germans \n chose primarily feminine properties, and Spanish speakers chose masculine ones.\nWhy?\nBecause their brains are hardwired to think of bridges in the manner their language tells them to; to Spanish people a bridge can be \u201cbig, dangerous, long, strong, sturdy, towering,\u201d but to Germans it can only be \u201cbeautiful, elegant, fragile, peaceful, pretty, and slender.\u201d\nAnd it gets even weirder.\nAs Lena Boroditsky and Lauren Schmidt discovered, if you ask a Spanish person to remember that a bridge is called Claudia, he/she is more likely to forget this than if you say that the bridge\u2019s name is Claudio; and the same holds true for Germans \u2013 only it is the other way around with them.\nThe conclusion?\nWell, we started this section with it: just reread the first sentence.\nAs the title of this section suggests, we\u2019re going back to every linguist\u2019s favorite field: the vocabulary of colors.\n\u201cIn returning to the subject of color,\u201d writes Deutsch here, \u201cthis final chapter tries to discharge an old debt, by turning on its head the nineteenth-century question about the relation between language and perception.\u201d\nWhat? What does \u201cturning on its head\u201d mean? Didn\u2019t we reach a conclusion already?\nWell, not exactly.\nGladstone and Geiger believed that \u201cdifferences in the vocabulary of color resulted from preexisting differences in color perception. But could it be that cause and effect have been reversed here? Is it possible that linguistic differences can be the cause of differences in perception?\u201d\nIn other words, is it possible that we see the colors in the way our language dictates us to see them?\nThe answer is \u201cyes.\u201d\nThe experiment is simple: English speakers are asked to choose the \u201codd one out\u201d from a series of three colored chips across the blue-green spectrum. \nThe trick?\nTwo of them are green, and the third one is greenish blue; however, the two greens are distanced between them on the spectrum much more than the greenish blue in relation to any of them.\nOf course, English people exaggerated the distance and always chose the greenish blue.\nThe same experiment was then conducted in Mexico, with speakers of an Indian language called Tarahumara.\nWhy?\nWell, as you would expect, because in Tarahumara green and blue are shades of one color\nNow, the Tarahumara speakers did not choose the greenish blue and didn\u2019t exaggerate the distance between chips on different sides of the green-blue border. \nThe official conclusion?\n\u201cThe difference between the responses of English and Tarahumara speakers,\u201d writes Deutsch, \u201cdemonstrated an influence of language on the perception of color.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cThrough the Language Glass\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Your Language Determines How Many Colors You See\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Gender of the Nouns in Your Language Influences How You Think About Their Real-World Counterparts\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Guugu Yimithirr People\n Know Left from Right\nYour Language Determines How Many Colors You See\nYou\u2019ve probably already heard that women can see more colors than men; \n, but it has more to do with our biology than anything else.\nHowever, regardless of whether they are men or women, all people see colors differently; and some of it is due to language.\nFor example, if you are English, you see two shades of blue where the Russians see two different colors. And experiments have shown that you are more capable of discerning between two very distant shades of green than between green and greenish blue \u2013 which is not the for Tarahumara Indians who don\u2019t have a different word for these colors.\nThe Gender of the Nouns in Your Language Influences How You Think About Their Real-World Counterparts\nAs you should know full well by now, there\u2019s miles and miles difference between sex and gender, since the latter is socially constructed and the former is a biological spectrum.\nWell, as far as language is concerned, gender is so dependent on conventions that it not only exists in a grammatical form, but it also differs from language to language.\nFor example, bridges are females for Germans and males for Spanish.\nThe strange part?\nSpanish people often describe them with masculine properties (long, towering, sturdy, hard), but Germans with feminine (beautiful, elegant, fragile, pretty).\nThe Guugu Yimithirr People \n Know Left from Right\nThe Guugu Yimithirr language is unusual in one peculiar manner: it doesn\u2019t have words for left, right, up, and down (egocentric directions), but instead uses the cardinal points (north, east, west, and south).\nThat means, as far as the Guugu Yimithirr people are concerned, you are not reading from left to right, but from east to west \u2013 or west to east, depending on whether your nose is pointing to south or north.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nThrough the Language Glass Quotes\nFinal Notes\nFor all intents and purposes, \nmay be the best language-relativity book you can find on the market; we, for one, haven\u2019t read a better one (and we\u2019re kind of interested in the subject).\nUnsurprisingly, when it was first published, \nwas voted one of the best books of the year by both the \nand \n, in addition to being a \n Editor\u2019s Choice.If you ask us, \n than deserved.\n\n"},

And Why?\nIf you consider yourself a good and honest person, then let Dan Ariely and his exceptional book, \n, burst your bubble: you are not, have never been, nor will ever be one.\nIf you want to learn \n and you are a psychology student, then this book is a good place to start \u2013 but be sure to check out Dan Ariely\u2019s other books as well (we\u2019ve summarized all of them just for you: \n).\nBut please read this one \n if you are a student of economics, because, well, you are taught wrong about practically everything.\nThe (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty Summary\nWhat the Enron Scandal Says About Your Deceitfulness\nWell, you all know the basic story by now, but it\u2019s worth repeating yet again because we\u2019re about to examine it in a wholly different manner.\nEnron Corporation \u2013 voted \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Innovative Company\u201d for six consecutive years \u2013 was an American energy company based in Houston, Texas, with claimed revenues of over $100 billion and a 30,000 staff in 2000.\nAnd then, by the end of the following year, Enron had to file for bankruptcy.\nWhat happened in the meantime?\nWell, in October 2001, it was publicized that through a series of pretty creative accounting tricks (accounting loopholes and special purpose entities, mostly), coupled with poor financial reporting (and, to some extent, disinterest for a proper one from the now-defunct firm Arthur Andersen), Enron had managed to hide billions of dollars in debt from failed projects and deals from its investors.\nThe main culprits?\n, the \u201cthree sinister C-level architects\u201d: Kenneth Lay (the Chairman), Jeffrey Skilling (the CEO), and Andrew Fastow (the CFO).\nThe problem?\nWell, \n.\nAnd that\u2019s exactly the thought that crossed the mind of Dan Ariely \u2013 the author of \n \u2013 after a discussion with a close friend of his, a one-time consultant for Enron.\nHe, in the words of Ariely, \u201chadn\u2019t seen anything sinister going on\u2026 Even more surprising, he also told me that once the information was out, he could not believe that he failed to see the signs all along.\u201d\n\u201cI started wondering if the problem of dishonesty goes deeper than just a few bad apples,\u201d writes Ariely. \u201cI also wondered whether my friends and I would have behaved similarly if we had been the ones consulting for Enron.\u201d\nYou already sense the answer, don\u2019t you?\nCalling All Art Enthusiasts\nOK, but that\u2019s Enron!\nThe larger and more complex a company is, the more difficult to \n what\u2019s going on and, let\u2019s face it, more tempting to \n something dishonest.\nAfter all, if Enron has revenues of $100 billion, then would anyone notice $50 missing?\nOK, then, another example.\nAnd this one involves the gift shops of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.\nAll you need to know for now is that these gift shops were run much like lemonade stands, meaning there were no cash registers, but merely cash boxes; and they did quite well, earning the Center about $400,000 on a yearly basis.\nHowever, each year, more than a fourth of that disappeared.\nThe manager tried to find the culprit and, after suspecting a young employee for a while, he organized a sting operation with the help from a detective; soon after, the young man was caught with marked bills in his pocket.\nProblem solved, right?\nWell, far from it: money and merchandise still went missing, even after the man was caught; in a way, catching him barely made any observable difference as to the amount of stolen cash.\nThe manager saw no way out but to set up an inventory system with price lists and sales records.\nSurprise, surprise: the thievery stopped.\nApparently, there wasn\u2019t just one bad apple: \n was stealing.\nOh, we forgot to tell you who everybody is!\nThe sales force at the gift shops were \u201celderly, well-meaning, art-loving volunteers,\u201d \u201cmostly retirees who loved theater and music.\u201d\nThe moral?\nIn the words of the manager: \u201cWe are going to take things from each other if we have a chance\u2026 many people need controls around them for them to do the right thing.\u201d\nBig Brother Is Watching\nIn a way, both Enron and the gift shops boil down to a simple problem: whether we\u2019re capable of resisting stealing something when nobody is watching.\nAnd this is a problem as old as time, going back all the way to Plato\u2019s \n.\nIn its first chapter, Plato\u2019s brother Glaucon asks Socrates whether a man can be virtuous if he knows for a fact that his crimes would be undetectable.\nTo illustrate his point, he tells the story of the Gyges ring, found by one of King Gyges\u2019 ancestors, a mere shepherd. \nWhen properly adjusted at the finger, this ring was so powerful that it granted invisibility to the one wearing it.\nOf course, Gyges used it to infiltrate the king\u2019s court, seduce the queen and eventually kill the king and crown himself as the next one.\n(Tolkien much, by the way?)\nNow, Socrates doesn\u2019t really answer Glaucon\u2019s question; he says, in many, many more words, that a man can be virtuous only if the state is, aka if he knows that the state is watching him/her.\nAnd, you know what?\n(Plug your ears, civil libertarians)\nHe was right!\n\u201cTo me,\u201d writes Ariely, \u201cPlato\u2019s myth offers a nice illustration of the notion that group settings can inhibit our propensity to cheat. When we work within a team, other team members can act informally as monitors, and, knowing that we are being watched, we may be less inclined to act dishonorably.\u201d\nDon\u2019t believe us?\nThere are experiments, boy!\nApparently, just putting an \n of eyes above an empty cash box asking for donations makes people donate much more than in its absence (or, if say, the image is of flowers).\nWhy?\nWell, let\u2019s see why.\nThe SMORC and Everything That\u2019s Wrong with It\nIf you know anything about Dan Ariely, then you already know that he\u2019s a behavioral economist who thinks (like \n) that rational economics is based on a serious study of human nature as much as the flat earth theory is based on a study of the Earth\u2019s circumference.\nAnd that\u2019s not an exaggeration!\nJust think of the SMORC, aka the Simple Model of Rational Crime.\nIts origin is pretty mundane.\nGary Becker, a Nobel-Prize-winning economist, once was running late for a meeting and couldn\u2019t find a legal parking spot. So, he opted to park illegally.\nWhy?\nBecause he decided that the cost of missing the meeting was greater than the cost of being caught, fined, and possibly towed.\nIn Becker\u2019s mind, that must be exactly what\u2019s happening in the mind of most criminals.\nThe problem is \u2013 we now know for a fact that it \nwork that way.\nTake this simple experiment.\nTwo groups are tasked with solving 20 math assignments and told that they would be given $5 for each correct solution.\nThere\u2019s a catch, of course: the first group\u2019s worksheets are reviewed, and the second one\u2019s claims are taken for granted.\nAs expected, the unreviewed tests were fascinatingly better: people claimed, on average, that they had solved 6 assignments when the other\u2019s group actual average was 4.\nNow, the stakes were upped: what if they are given $10 or $15?\nAccording to SMORC, they should have claimed to have performed better.\nBut that didn\u2019t happen.\nIn fact, nothing changed.\nThe most interesting part?\nNothing changes even if the unreviewed group is given the opportunity to shred their tests, thus eliminating the chance of being caught.\nTwo Types of Motivation\nThe reason why the SMORC is wrong is pretty simple: the motivation to lie is merely one aspect of our character.\n\u201cHonesty and dishonesty,\u201d clarifies Ariely, \u201care based on a mixture of two very different types of motivation. On the one hand, we want to benefit from cheating (this is the rational economic motivation), while on the other, we want to be able to view ourselves as wonderful human beings (this is the psychological motivation).\u201d\nIn other words, we want to both have our cake and eat it too.\nRationally, this is impossible.\nHowever, as Dan Ariely has demonstrated to us \n and \n, we are not rational beings.\nAnd our comprise is surprisingly simple.\n\u201cBasically,\u201d concludes Ariely, \u201cas long as we cheat just a little bit, we can have the cake and eat (some of) it too. We can reap some of the benefits of dishonesty while maintaining a positive image of ourselves.\u201d\nThis is what Ariely terms the \u201cfudge factor theory.\u201d\nIn essence, it\u2019s about balancing things right.\nThe psychological motivation \u2013 our innate wish to see ourselves as wonderful human beings \u2013 is just as powerful as the rational economic drive: to earn more with less.\nAnd this is exactly why certain forces such as the two described above (\u201cthe amount of money we stand to gain and the probability of being caught\u201d) influence our decisions much less than one might think they do.\nAt the same time, other forces influence us \nthan we might expect.\nThere\u2019s a whole list of the latter: \u201cmoral reminders, distance from money, conflicts of interest, depletion, counterfeits, reminders of our fabricated achievements, creativity, witnessing others\u2019 dishonest acts, caring about others on our team, and so on.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see how the first two of them work in practice.\nMay the Ten Commandments Be Engraved in You\nLet\u2019s add another twist to the experiment with the two groups assigned with solving a math test.\nThe first one \u2013 if you read carefully \u2013 was informed that their test would be reviewed; the second one that there\u2019s no mathematician in the house, so the guys shelling out the money ($5 for a correct solution) would have to take their word for it.\nThe twist is this: the second group was now divided into two groups, one of which was asked to reread the Ten Commandments before the test; the other one was instructed to recall ten random books studied in high school.\nThe last group cheated as much as they did previously; however, the group which recalled the Ten Commandments before solving the test didn\u2019t; at all.\nApparently, it doesn\u2019t even matter if you are religious or not. What matters is the \n that there\u2019s something more to cheating than your own benefit.\nHere\u2019s another example for the atheists who can\u2019t empathize with the above one.\nA business consultant (actually, a comedian in disguise) comes to your school and gives you a lesson on how to cheat and get away with it.\nDo you:\na) consider the advice helpful;\nb) have an uneasy feeling that a business consultant is telling you this; or\nc) both of the above.\nFor most people, it\u2019s \n, aka a clear example of seeing both motivations at work.\n\u201cThese advices are good for you,\u201d says the rational voice in your head. \u201cWait a second,\u201d a second one, psychologically-motivated voice joins in, \u201cisn\u2019t it \n to do this?\u201d\nOne Step Removed from the Money\nAnother experiment shows precisely why the more distant you are from the money, the less tempted you are to do something bad.\nThe experiment goes something like this.\nIn an MIT dorm, half of the communal refrigerators are stacked with six packs of Coca-Cola; the other half with paper plates containing six $1 bills.\nOf course, all of the students know that neither the Cokes nor the dollar bills belong to them; also: they all know (or have a vague idea) that the \n worth of the two is pretty much the same (you can buy a Coke for $1).\nWhat do you think happened after three days?\nYup: all of the Cokes were gone, but not one of the dollar bills was touched. Even though nothing stopped the students from taking a dollar bill, walking over to the nearby vending machine and getting a Coke and some change; for some reason, no one did.\nAnd that reason is psychological: \u201cthe fudge factor\u201d increases the greater the psychological distance between the dishonest act and its consequences.\nIn plainer words, it is easier for you to rationalize that you are a good person if you need just one step of rationalizations to do that (taking Coke); however, if it takes you more than one (taking the money \n buying Coke), then it\u2019s more difficult to digest that psychologically.\nIt\u2019s basically the difference between murdering someone with malice and murdering someone in a state of affectation. There are two different punishments for that\nbecause\nin the first case, you had the time to change your mind.\n\u201cFrom all the research I have done over the years,\u201d concludes Ariely, \u201cthe idea that worries me the most is that the more cashless our society becomes, the more our moral compass slips.\u201d\nIs There a Solution?\nAriely\u2019s book abounds with examples and experiments such as the few described above, each more interesting than the other.\nHowever, for the purposes of this summary, we decided to limit ourselves to the few which most directly say what should one do if he/she wants to limit dishonesty.\nIn a way, it\u2019s nothing that we don\u2019t know intuitively already but is everything most rational economists and politicians forget when setting up our systems (hence, the crises).\nHere\u2019s a secular (and elegant) example which speaks volumes about \n.\nA woman in South America noticed that her maid had been stealing a little bit of meat from the freezer every few days. \nShe was rich enough to not care about this too much, but nobody likes to be cheated (especially if that leaves you with not enough meat to make dinner sometimes) so she decided to do something about.\nAnd no \u2013 she didn\u2019t organize a private detective or fired the maid.\nShe just put a lock on the freezer and told the maid that she suspected someone is stealing from the freezer; then, she gave her a key to the lock and a small financial promotion, adding that the two of them are the only ones who now have the key and must be watchful.\nOf course this worked!\nBecause by putting a lock on the freezer the woman both put a check on the maid\u2019s temptations \n created a psychological distance.\nNow, stealing the meat would mean making two steps (unlocking the freezer and then taking some meat), and that\u2019s not easy to rationalize.\nFinally, by singling out the maid as the most trustful person, the woman put a moral burden on her, the one the Ten Commandments put on the math-testers.\nAnd that made all the difference.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Honesty and Dishonesty are Based on a Mixture of Two Contrasting Motivations \n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You Constantly Rationalize Your Dishonesty to Make Yourself Look Good (to You)\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The More Distant the Dishonest Act, the More Difficult to Cheat \nHonesty and Dishonesty are Based on a Mixture of Two Contrasting Motivations \nAccording to most economists, people cheat only after making a rational cost/benefit analysis. In other words, if there\u2019s a low chance of being caught and a high benefit from a dishonest act, then it\u2019s only human to cheat.\nHowever, behavioral economists have discovered that it doesn\u2019t work that way. Apparently, we do do this cost/benefit analysis, but only in combination with a psychological \n of the actions. In plainer words, we only cheat \n and \n we can rationalize it.\nYou Constantly Rationalize Your Dishonesty to Make Yourself Look Good (to You)\nMixed, this motivation works like this.\nIf you are given a test with twenty questions and promised to be given $5 for every correct answer, but told that there\u2019s nobody to review your answers \u2013 then you\u2019ll probably cheat. \nAnd you\u2019ll cheat no more even if they gave you $50 dollars for a correct answer and offered you an opportunity to shred the test afterward, you\u2019ll cheat.\nWhy?\nBecause cheating too much can put a strain on your brain; and you want your brain to process your cheating in a certain \u201cI did it, but not as much as I could\u201d manner.\nBecause this both allows you to cheat and makes you a good person.\nThe More Distant the Dishonest Act, the More Difficult to Cheat\nThe more obstacles are there between you and the dishonest act, the bigger the strain on your brain.\nThat\u2019s why you\u2019ll think twice before stealing someone\u2019s money but only once before stealing someone\u2019s Coca Cola.\nPoliticians and economists \u2013 please, use this knowledge!\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nThe (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty Quotes\nFinal Notes\nis everything you\u2019d expect from a book written by Ariely (or any other popular behavioral economist nowadays): thought-provoking, counterintuitive, and filled with experiments.\n\u201cRequired reading for politicians and Wall Street executives,\u201d says a Booklist review. \nRequired reading for everyone, we add."},

And Why?\nis one of the classics in the fields of cultural criticism and media studies so everyone interested in them should have already read it.\nHowever, Neil Postman\u2019s 1984 vision about the world of today seems so true that we think everybody should read this book.\nNot reading it would be basically synonymous with ignoring a traffic post sign saying \u201cStop. Dead End. No outlet.\u201d \nWe\u2019re serious about this.\nAmusing Ourselves to Death Summary\nWhen 1984 came, and \n of a world run by totalitarian governments didn\u2019t pan out the way everybody feared it would, \u201cAmerican sang softly in praise of themselves.\u201d And they sang even louder six years later \n.\nNeil Postman, however, was a bit worried. Because, in his mind, humanity was losing the battle and \u2013 what\u2019s worse \u2013 it was losing it on a largely ignored field.\nAnd that\u2019s the message Postman wanted to relay to the participants of a panel on Orwell at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1984.\nHis main point?\nOrwell may have been wrong about the future, and that is one fight we won; however, Aldous Huxley was dead-on right, and, unfortunately, that is the war we\u2019ll eventually lose.\nGeorge Orwell vs. Aldous Huxley\nBut aren\u2019t Orwell and Huxley saying the same thing?\nAbsolutely not, says Neil Postman.\n\u201cContrary to common belief even among the educated,\u201d he writes, \u201cHuxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley\u2019s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity, and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.\u201d\nAnd then Postman explains the differences between \nand of \nFirst and foremost, he says, Orwell \u2013 \n \u2013 feared censorship and people banning books; Huxley, on the other hand, feared that there would be no reason to ban books in the future because nobody would be reading them. \nPoint: Huxley.\nSecondly, Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information; Huxley feared the ones who would give us so much \u201cthat we would be reduced to passivity and egoism.\u201d \nSo, 2:0.\nIn plainer terms, Orwell feared that truth would be concealed from us; Huxley feared that the truth \u201cwould be drowned in a sea of irrelevance.\u201d \n3:0.\nThirdly, Orwell feared that humans would become slaves; Huxley, on the other hand, feared that humans might just become \n free. In fact, Huxley explicitly remarked in \n that\nthe civil libertarians and rationalists always oppose tyranny but fail \u201cto take into account man\u2019s almost infinite appetite for distractions.\u201d\n4:0.\nFourthly, Orwell feared a world where we will be controlled by inflicting pain; Huxley a world where we will be controlled by inflicting pleasure. \n5:0.\n\u201cIn short,\u201d Postman concludes, \u201cOrwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.\u201d \nGame, set, and match.\nWhatever Happens in Vegas\u2026 Happens in the USA As Well\n\u201cAt different times in our history,\u201d writes Neil Postman at the beginning of \n, \u201cdifferent cities have been the focal point of a radiating American spirit.\u201d\nIn the late 18\n century, for example, Boston \u201cwas the center of a political radicalism that ignited a shot heard round the world;\u201d and, in a way, \n, even Virginians became Bostonians. And this was all embodied in a recognizable statue: the Minuteman.\nSoon after, America, symbolically, became New York: \u201cthe melting-pot\u201d for the \u201cwretched refuse\u201d of the world. We don\u2019t need to tell you the figurative embodiment of New York\u2019s spirit: the Statue of Liberty.\nAnd then, in the early 20\n century, Chicago, \u201cthe city of big shoulders and heavy winds, came to symbolize the industrial energy and dynamism of America.\u201d The statue that should personify this period: a hog butcher, an appropriate \u201creminder of the time when America was railroads, cattle, steel mills and entrepreneurial adventures.\u201d\nThe city that represents the American spirit \u2013 call it the global spirit, if you will \u2013 today?\nLas Vegas, Nevada, \u201ca city entirely devoted to the idea of entertainment, and as such proclaims the spirit of a culture in which all public discourse increasingly takes the form of entertainment.\u201d\nIts symbol is \u201ca thirty-foot-high cardboard picture of a slot machine and a chorus girl\u201d and the very fact that this is possible spells doom \u2013 not in the Orwellian boom, but in the Eliotian whimper kind of way.\n\u201cOur politics, religion, news, athletics, education and commerce,\u201d writes Postman ominously, \u201chave been transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business, largely without protest or even much popular notice. The result is that we are a people on the verge of amusing ourselves to death.\u201d\nThe (D)evolution of the Culture\nTo understand how we got there, you need to understand the transformation of our culture: from word-based to image-based one. \nIt may sound theoretical at the moment, but by the end of this summary, you\u2019ll probably understand what it \n means much better than you\u2019ll even want to.\nFirst, lets\u2019 go back to the years when the USA was established.\nBack in 1776, Thomas Paine published \n; the book, as you know full well from your high-school classes, sold about 100,000 copies in just three months and a half million by the end of the decade.\nAnd you know how many people lived in the United States according to its first (1790) census?\nA little less than 4 million!\nIn other words, a sixth of the American population bought and, based on the discussions at the time, \nthe book.\nEven according to conservative estimates, that would mean that a book has to sell about 40-50,000,000 copies today to be considered as successful as Paine\u2019s!\nAnd, let\u2019s face it, Paine\u2019s book wasn\u2019t a cookbook or an epic fantasy novel.\nIn the 19\n century, things took off from where one would expect them to: the American (and the global) culture became word-centered to the point that many intellectuals casually \n in a style that, to today\u2019s readers, would seem pretty much indistinguishable from writing.\nLet\u2019s go back to the middle of the century, for example.\nOn October 16, 1854, two \n presidential candidates \u2013 Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas \u2013 gave speeches which lasted for hours and hours.\nMore precisely, first Douglas delivered a 3-hour address to the people of Peoria, Illinois, to which Lincoln, by agreement, was supposed to respond.\nAnd you know what Lincoln did?\nHe proposed that the audience go home and have a dinner and then return because he would probably need at least as much time as Douglas (in fact, he took an hour more).\nPostman\u2019s amazement doesn\u2019t stop at the speakers.\n\u201cWhat kind of audience was this?\u201d he asks \u201cWho were these people who could so cheerfully accommodate themselves to seven hours of oratory?\u201d\nIt\u2019s even more amazing to think that Douglas and Lincoln weren\u2019t presidential candidates in 1854; in fact, they weren\u2019t even candidates for the Senate back then. \nAnd yet, many people spent most of their days listening to their speeches.\nNowadays, even a 20-minute dissertation defense seems boring and long.\n\u201cWe are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas,\nbut Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate,\u201d wrote Henry David Thoreau in \na few months before Lincoln and Douglas had one of their first many-hours-long debates, doubting the benefits (or even the need) of the telegraphic cable.\n \u201cWe are eager to tunnel under the Atlantic and bring the old world some weeks nearer to the new,\u201d he went on, \u201cbut perchance the first news that will leak through into the broad, flapping American ear will be that Princess Adelaide has the whooping cough.\u201d\nMost of Thoreau\u2019s \n may sound a bit outdated, but he was right (and far-seeing) about one thing.\nNamely, the fact that we are so well-connected may mean that we are nominally better informed, but more data doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re getting closer to the truth.\nIn fact, it means the opposite: \n, but also between relevant and non-relevant information.\nIn retrospect, the Telegraph struck the first blow to the Word (and in an Orwellian Newspeak manner), but Photography knocked it out cold.\nSuddenly, advertisers realized that an image is worth a thousand words, and that, when taken out of context, it may have the value of a million more.\nAnd that\u2019s how show-business was born.\nWhen \nwas first published, the President of the United States was Ronald Reagan, a former Hollywood movie actor. \nIn the meantime \u2013 and this is scary, we\u2019re telling you this is \n\u2013 we\u2019ve managed to make a step \n: now, the actors are in the Senate, and our president is a former reality TV star!\nWhat\u2019s next? A dog for a president? \nWe\u2019re not overreacting here!\nBecause the problem \u2013 spotted by Neil Postman and growing worse by the decade \u2013 is a pretty serious one.\nNamely, more than smart people, we like pop-stars; and more than serious intellectual endeavors, we want entertainment.\nThat\u2019s why the people who get to the high places have become, more often than not, pop-stars who entertain.\nIt\u2019s their faces we are interested in \u2013 not their words.\nWord-Centered vs. Image-Centered Culture\nTo understand the evolution outlined above better, you need to understand that before the advent of photography and telegraphy, \u201cthe printed word had a monopoly on both attention and intellect, there being no other means, besides the oral tradition, to have access to public knowledge.\u201d\nConsequently, public figures \u2013 even the most famous ones \u2013 were almost exclusively known through their written words \u2013 not by their looks and not even by their oratory.\n\u201cIt is quite likely that most of the first fifteen presidents of the United States,\u201d writes Neil Postman thought-provokingly, \u201cwould not have been recognized had they passed the average citizen in the street. This would have been the case as well of the great lawyers, ministers, and scientists of that era.\u201d\nIn other words, to \n about these great men meant, by definition, to think about what they had written, \u201cto judge them by their public positions, their arguments, their knowledge as codified in the printed word.\u201d\nAnd you already sense where this is going.\nQuite probably, the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, or Billy Graham \u2013 or to be more contemporary: Trump, Obama, Bush \u2013 is an image, a picture of their face, and most likely one seen on the television screen.\nWant one better?\n.\nYou think you know him, right \u2013 because you\u2019ve seen quite a few photographs of his face; however, think about his writings and \u201calmost nothing will come to mind,\u201d because, well, let\u2019s face it: you haven\u2019t read anything.\nThat\u2019s the basic difference between \nin a word-centered and an image-centered culture. \nThe latter is hardly thinking, isn\u2019t it?\nThe main culprit?\nTV, of course.\nThe Twilight of Intellectualism: Television\nOf course you don\u2019t agree with the title!\nBut that\u2019s precisely the problem.\nBecause, in a very real manner, the title is all but a fact: you can\u2019t consider yourself an intellectual if you spend four or five hours watching TV.\nAnd that\u2019s how many hours the average American spends in front of the television!\nSince you\u2019re already resistant to insights such as this, let Neil Postman explain to you a thing or two about your TV-watching habits.\nEven though he speaks primarily about \u201cthe philosophy of the education which television offers,\u201d we don\u2019t think that we\u2019re wrong if we say, paraphrasing Neil Postman, that all TV programs adhere to three commandments:\nIn other words: no prior knowledge is necessary. \u201cThere must not be even a hint that learning is hierarchical, that it is an edifice constructed on a foundation,\u201d notes Postman. \u201cThe learner must be allowed to enter at any point without prejudice.\u201d\nThe more complicated a TV program is, the fewer viewers it has. Do we really need to spell it out for you? That means that all television is simple by definition. \u201cIt is assumed that any information, story or idea can be made immediately accessible, since the contentment, not the growth, of the learner is paramount.\u201d\nThis one may sound a bit more complicated, but it is still a pretty simple commandment, boiling down to the simplest idea of all: television is all about story-telling, and not one bit about \u201carguments, hypotheses, discussions, reasons, refutations or any of the traditional instruments of reasoned discourse turn television into radio or, worse, third-rate printed matter.\u201d\nAll in all, whether you\u2019re watching a commercial or Carl Sagan\u2019s \n, \n or \n\u2013 they are all primarily interested in framing their lessons in simple images and stories that can be gobbled down immediately and without prior knowledge.\nTo sum up, TV is for us what the gladiator fights were for Rome.\nAnd we know for a fact that Roman generals used gladiator fights as a smokescreen, as a way to do what they want while the public is entertained to death \u2013 for some guys, quite literally.\nWhat does that say about our TV-watching habits?\nWell, almost nothing good.\nFirst and foremost, that we\u2019ve managed to transform reality into an entertainment show \u2013 and that we are not even aware of this.\nDon\u2019t believe us?\nThink of the news, first. Why do they have beautiful hosts and presenters? Why do they have music? Why do they relate most of their news in a story-like fashion? Finally, why are they interspersed with commercials? Does it really make any sense for you to hear about the mass shootings at a school and \nsee a McDonalds commercial?\nAnd what about the public debates? Think of it this way: in a world of alternate facts (created by TV), does it matter who tells the truth? Of course not. And that\u2019s why the victor is always the best showman. That\u2019s why the Jordan Peterson vs. Slavoj Zizek debate was such an event: the two are primarily showmen.\nThe absurd go to such heights that there are nowadays religious TV channels. Really? What\u2019s so sacred about the very medium which created this world which habitually glorifies show-biz scandals, violence, and sex?\nNothing.\nWell, except for the money that is.\nIs there a way out?\nWell, according to Neil Postman, there is; but it\u2019s counter-intuitive.\nNamely \u2013 bad TV.\n\u201cTelevision,\u201d concludes Postman, \u201cserves us most usefully when presenting junk-entertainment; it serves us most ill when it co-opts serious modes of discourse\u2014news, politics, science, education, commerce, religion\u2014and turns them into entertainment packages. We would all be better off if television got worse, not better.\u201d\nWant examples?\nPostman has them:\n\u201cThe A-Team\u201d and \u201cCheers,\u201d he says, are no threat to our public health. However, TV programs such as \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d \u201cEye-Witness News\u201d and \u201cSesame Street\u201d are.\nYou know their modern correlatives.\nStop watching them.\nAnd, more importantly, don\u2019t ever allow your kids to watch them.\nKey Lessons from \u201cAmusing Ourselves to Death\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Orwell Was, Fortunately, Wrong; Huxley, Unfortunately, Wasn\u2019t\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We Live in an Image-Centered World \u2013 and That\u2019s Very Bad\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Three Commandments of (Educational) TV\nOrwell Was, Fortunately, Wrong; Huxley, Unfortunately, Wasn\u2019t\nWe all know Orwell\u2019s dystopian vision of the future from \n; anyone who is old enough to remember the days of communism knows full well how much we feared it might become a reality. Fortunately, both Orwell and our parents were wrong.\nUnfortunately, says Neil Postman, another dystopian vision of the future has, in the meantime, turned into reality: the one prophesized by Huxley in \n.\nThe main difference between the two?\nOrwell believed that we would be controlled through inflictions of pain (the boot stomping on a human face), but Huxley feared that we would one day be controlled through inflictions of pleasure.\nAccording to Postman, though we\u2019ve escaped the former, we\u2019re living in the latter, TV being our modern-day soma.\nWe Live in an Image-Centered World \u2013 and That\u2019s Very Bad\nThe world of the 19\n century was a word-centered one: people knew other people (even presidential candidates and scientists) merely through their words. \nMost of the first fifteen US presidents would have probably been able to walk the street unnoticed by the majority; but even if they had written something anonymously, they would have probably been found out.\nNowadays, it\u2019s the other way around: we know how Einstein looks like, even though we haven\u2019t read anything by him (and barely a few Wikipedia sentences \nhim).\nThe problem?\nThe image-centered world destroys our capability to \n properly; we are bombarded by images, and we are incapable of making proper sense of the world.\nThe Three Commandments of (Educational) TV\nThe main culprit for the pervasiveness of this image-centered world philosophy is, of course, TV. \nAnd TV, according to Postman, adheres as strictly to three commandments as fundamental Judaists adhere to Moses commandants.\nAnd these are:\n#1. Thou shalt have no prerequisites;\n#2. Thou shalt induce no perplexity;\n#3. Thou shalt avoid exposition like the ten plagues visited upon Egypt.\nIn summary, they mean that all TV (regardless whether it\u2019s the news or \n, \n \n or commercials) is packaged in simple narratives which require no previous knowledge to be digested.\nBut learning doesn\u2019t work that way; neither does intellectual thinking.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nAmusing Ourselves to Death Quotes\nFinal Notes\nis a well-written and well-argued book, both immensely powerful and (unfortunately) amazingly far-sighted in its predictions.\n\u201cAs a fervent evangelist of the age of Hollywood,\u201d wrote Camille Paglia recently and apologetically, proving this, \u201cI publicly opposed Neil Postman\u2019s dark picture of our media-saturated future.

And Why?\nIf you are interested in the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer but you are not that keen on spending many a tiresome hour reading \n,\nthen\nis as a good alternative as any.\nOne of the six essays from the first\npart of his 1851 book, \n, \nwas originally intended to work as an appendix to Schopenhauer\u2019s philosophy.\nTrue, this may mean that you won\u2019t get to the bottom of it \u2013 for better: it is dark and gloomy there \u2013 or that you won\u2019t even understand some parts of it the way you should be, but the essay is, nevertheless, approachable, comprehensible and, for the most part of it, \nby itself. \nAdd to this its subject \u2013 human happiness and how to attain it \u2013 and you already know that this is one curious kind of a self-help book you\u2019re not allowed to pass on.\nThe Wisdom of Life Summary\n\u201cIn these pages, I shall speak of \n in the common meaning of the term, as the art, namely, of ordering our lives so as to obtain the greatest possible amount of pleasure and success.\u201d\nThus begins Arthur Schopenhauer his essay on happiness which he then says is merely another addition to the study of happiness, or as the Greeks called it Eudaimonology (\n, you guess, is the Greek word for happiness).\nTo those who know at least something about Schopenhauer, the sentence above may seem a bit strange. After all, the man is basically synonymous with pessimism in the world of philosophy! \nAnd you kinda get that feeling right from the start when Schopenhauer defines the happy existence as one \u201cwhich, looked at from a purely objective point of view, or, rather, after cool and mature reflection \u2014 for the question necessarily involves subjective considerations \u2014 would be decidedly preferable to non-existence.\u201d\nIf you want a bit clearer formulation, this means that the happy existence, for Schopenhauer is one we cling to \u201cfor its own sake, and not merely from the fear of death,\u201d one we don\u2019t like to come to an end.\nYou understood that right: in short, to Schopenhauer, happiness is a temporary state which doesn\u2019t make you want to kill yourself.\nGreat start, Arthur!\nAnd it gets even weirder!\nIn the very second paragraph from the \u201cIntroduction,\u201d Schopenhauer makes clear that the very idea that man can be happy is ridiculous: \u201cthis hypothesis,\u201d he writes, \u201cis based upon a fundamental mistake.\u201d\nHowever, he goes on, he is willing to make a compromise and \u201ctake the common standpoint of every day, and embrace the error which is at the bottom of it.\u201d\nWell, the scene is yours, Arthur: please do!\nChapter I: Division of the Subject\nOf course, the question of happiness is neither a new one nor one rarely explored by\n. \nHowever, as far as Schopenhauer is concerned, none of them really got to the bottom of it. On the contrary, in fact, they made numerous incorrect guesses.\nAristotle, for example, in \n, divides the blessings into three categories: \u201cthose which come to us from without, those of the soul, and those of the body.\u201d\nAccording to Schopenhauer, he was only right about the number. In other words, there \n three distinct classes of \u201cfundamental differences in human lot,\u201d but they are much different:\n: this refers to a man\u2019s personality, in the widest sense of the word; meaning, it includes a man\u2019s health, beauty, strength, moral character, temperament, intelligence, and education; \n: this encompasses \u201cproperty and possessions of every kind,\u201d aka material wealth; and\n: \u201cby which is to be understood, as everybody knows, what a man is in the eyes of his fellowmen, or, more strictly, the light in which they regard him. This is shown by their opinion of him; and their opinion is in its turn manifested by the honor in which he is held, and by his rank and reputation.\u201d\nOf course, there\u2019s a big difference between the degree with which each of these three contributes to one\u2019s overall happiness, with #1 (i.e., man\u2019s nature) kind of governing the other two (#2 and #3).\nTime to explore them one by one and see why this is so.\nChapter II: Personality or What a Man Is\nAlready in Chapter I, Schopenhauer notes that \u201cthe world in which a man lives shapes itself chiefly by the way in which he looks at it, and so it proves different to different men.\u201d \nA man of genius, in other words, may see happiness in all sorts of banal things, while an ordinary individual can see nothing of this sort even in majestic things.\nTo explain this better, he uses Goethe and Byron\u2019s poems, which, he says, are obviously founded upon actual facts.\nNow, most people, upon reading them or finding out about all of the interesting things described in the verses, start envying the poets and thinking things like \u201cOh, why doesn\u2019t something like this happen to me for once!\u201d\nHowever, Schopenhauer says, \u201cit is only a foolish person who would envy the poet because so many delightful things happened to him, instead of envying that mighty power of phantasy which was capable of turning a fairly common experience into something so great and beautiful.\u201d\nIn layman\u2019s terms, it\u2019s not that Goethe or Byron found better romantic partners than you; it\u2019s just that they were smart enough to transform their pretty normal love life into something grander. Objectively, their love wasn\u2019t that much different from yours; but they were smart enough to \n see it that way.\n\u201cThe life of the fool,\u201d says the Bible (Ecclesiasticus 22:11), \u201cis worse than death.\u201d Schopenhauer goes a step further: \u201ca man is sociable just in the degree in which he is intellectually poor and generally vulgar.\u201d\nOf course, just a sentence later he makes an extremely racist remark concerning \u201cthe most sociable of all people\u2026 the negroes\u201d \u2013 so, we are really starting to wonder how many friends did Schopenhauer have, i.e., how smart he actually was.\nRacism aside, Schopenhauer has a point: even if you are the richest person in the world (#2), admired by just about anyone on this planet (#3), you\u2019d still probably feel a gaping hole inside if you are a fool, because, as Seneca noted once, \u201cfolly is its own burden.\u201d\nTo understand better why \u201cwhat a man is\u201d \n takes up a large portion of his ability to feel happiness, it\u2019s probably smart to think about another aspect of our \u201cpersonalities,\u201d i.e., our general health.\n\u201cHealth outweighs all other blessings,\u201d writes Schopenhauer, noting that \u201ca healthy beggar is happier than an ailing king.\u201d\nIt\u2019s kind of difficult to argue with this because, let\u2019s face it, you can\u2019t even enjoy your favorite TV show if you\u2019re sick in bed with temperature. And even if you had all the money in the world at that moment, the only thing you\u2019d ask for is a cure.\n\u201cA healthy person has a thousand wishes,\u201d says an old (probably Indian) proverb, \u201cbut a sick person only one \u2013 to get well.\u201d\nChapter III: Property, or What a Man Has\n\u201cI don\u2019t care too much for money,\u201d sang the Beatles famously in 1964, \u201cmoney can\u2019t buy me love.\u201d \nBut that was only a year after they covered Barrett Strong\u2019s \u201cMoney\u201d and announced to the world that \u201cmoney don\u2019t get everything it\u2019s true/ what it don\u2019t get, I can\u2019t use: now give me money, that\u2019s what I want.\u201d\nSo, which of the two is true according to Schopenhauer?\nWell, in a way, both of them \u2013 because (as Epicurus first demonstrated) there are different things that money \n buy and different \n they satisfy:\n: those that, when not satisfied, produce pain, such as food and clothing;\n: these are all the things that gratify the senses; since they gratify them, they \n natural; however, the absence of them, doesn\u2019t cause any pain in the case of many people; and\n: these are the luxuries.\nSchopenhauer notes that #1 are the most discernible and the most easily satisfiable needs; #2 are a bit more difficult to categorize and even more difficult to satisfy. #3 are both the least comprehensible and are almost impossible to satisfy: they \u201cnever come to an end.\u201d\nOf course, the needs vary from person to person.\nFor example, if you are born wealthy, you\u2019d probably adapt to a certain lifestyle which you wouldn\u2019t want to lose, deeming a necessity something others would consider a luxury. \nOn the upside, if you are lucky enough to have been born rich, you\u2019d probably develop a more independent mind, and you\u2019d probably acquire a certain set of talents which would allow you to extract happiness from things a beggar rarely would (such as poetry).\nChapter IV: Position, or A Man\u2019s Place in the Estimation of Others\nThe fourth chapter of Schopenhauer\u2019s \n is, by far, the longest one and is divided into five sections, each one dealing with a different aspect of \u201ca man\u2019s place in the estimation of others.\u201d\n\u201cBy a peculiar weakness of human nature,\u201d notes Schopenhauer, \u201cpeople generally think too much about the opinion which others form of them, although the slightest reflection will show that this opinion, whatever it may be, is not in itself essential to happiness.\u201d\nTo illustrate \u201chis perverse and exuberant respect for other people\u2019s opinion,\u201d Schopenhauer uses two examples, both from the gallows and both dated back to 1846.\nIn the first case, a man named Thomas Wix was executed for murdering his master. \u201cOn reaching the scaffold,\u201d says a contemporary report, \u201cthe miserable wretch mounted the drop without the slightest assistance, and when he got to the center, he bowed to the spectators twice, a proceeding which called forth a tremendous cheer from the degraded crowd beneath.\u201d\nWhy would a man care about generating a cheer from a crowd a mere second before his inevitable death \u2013 is beyond Schopenhauer.\nEven stranger: a guy named Lecompte, executed in Frankfurt for an attempt on the king\u2019s life, was annoyed on the day of execution that he was not allowed to shave and appear in decent attire before the crowd.\nGo figure!\nSchopenhauer notes that this hunger for other people\u2019s approval is the reason for numerous life anxieties and that it is the source of vanity, one of the biblical obstacles to attaining happiness.\nThe other side of the vanity coin: pride.\nVanity, says Schopenhauer, is the desire to arrive at appreciation indirectly, \n; pride, on the other hand, is \u201cthe direct appreciation of oneself.\u201d\nPride, in other words, \u201cis an established conviction of one\u2019s own paramount worth in some particular respect; while vanity is the desire of rousing such a conviction in others.\u201d\nNow, \u201cthe cheapest sort of pride,\u201d in Schopenhauer\u2019s opinion, is national pride.\nWhy?\nWell, because \u2013 explains Schopenhauer \u2013 \u201cif a man is proud of his own nation, it argues that he has no qualities of his own of which he can be proud; otherwise he would not have recourse to those which he shares with so many millions of his fellowmen.\u201d\nAnd he goes even a step further: only people who see the follies of their nations and don\u2019t really like them can be considered intelligent ones.\nTake that, nationalists!\nRank has \u201cpurely conventional value\u201d and, in Schopenhauer\u2019s opinion, can be dismissed in a few words.\nAnd those few words are these: rank \u201cis a sham; its method is to exact an artificial respect, and, as a matter of fact, the whole thing is a mere farce.\u201d\nSchopenhauer wrote at a time when it mattered a lot to be a prince or a count or a Sir, and a century and a half later, we see that he was right in the above \n.\nThere are fewer and fewer people today who think that someone is worthier than them merely because he has obtained some kind of a state title; consequently, there are fewer and fewer people really dreaming about them.\nWhich is a great thing!\nSchopenhauer admits that talking about honor is much more difficult than talking about rank, but, ultimately, he dismisses it as well as because mostly it is a \u201cprimitive and innate characteristic of human nature,\u201d the other side of \n.\nThere are two types of honor, he argues: objective (in the eyes of others) and subjective (in your own eyes). The latter one doesn\u2019t matter as much as the former one since one\u2019s opinion of oneself doesn\u2019t count if it isn\u2019t reaffirmed by others.\nAnd others can affirm it in four different ways:\n. This is the basic type of honor, \u201cthe widest sphere of all;\u201d it is what prevents us from using \u201cany unjust or unlawful means of getting what we want,\u201d aka \u201cthe condition of all peaceable intercourse between man and man,\u201d aka the thing which allows for societies to exist.\n. This is the honor you get (or at least you \na century or two ago) when you\u2019re serving other people in the public sphere; yup, Schopenhauer is talking about teachers, doctors, lawyers, and soldiers;\n. You\u2019ve met the racist Schopenhauer, now it\u2019s time you meet the sexist Arthur: a man gets honor from serving the household by bringing in the money, a woman gets honor from (wait for it\u2026) being \n (if girl) and \n (if woman). A woman\u2019s honor is much more important, says Schopenhauer, because \u201cwomen depend upon men in all the relations of life; men upon women, it might be said, in one only.\u201d That\u2019s just fantastic!\n. This is the only one which depends on another person\u2019s opinion \u2013 and, thus, it is the most primitive one. You know, the one which made people organize duels and kill each other over nothing.\nFame is honor\u2019s twin, and in the sense Castor and Pollux were twins in Greek mythology: while one is mortal, the other is not. \nOf course, Schopenhauer is talking about true fame, the one which is undying and lasts more than a day.\n\u201cFame is something which must be won,\u201d he notes, \u201chonor, only something which must \n be lost.\u201d\nIt\u2019s difficult to attain fame: it both takes a lot of effort and, for a large part, it doesn\u2019t depend on you whether you\u2019ll ever get it. \nThis last part is why you shouldn\u2019t worry about it too much.\nFame, in the wrong and outdated opinion of Schopenhauer, is but a reflection of your own great personality \u2013 i.e., what you are (Chapter II).\nIn other words, if you strive for greatness (i.e., achieving a great personality), then you might just become famous (even if merely after death), and you\u2019ll certainly be a bit happier than the other people.\nHowever, if you strive to become famous, not only you\u2019ll never become a great person, you\u2019ll probably never be happy as well.\nThat makes a bit more sense theoretically \u2013 but the 21\n century called, Arthur, and it has given you an F on your essay on this subject.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Wisdom of Life\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If You Can\u2019t Find Any Happiness in Solitude \u2013 Then You Are, by Definition, Stupid\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If You Need Money or Fame to be Happy \u2013 Then You Are, by Definition, Stupid\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If You Are a Nationalist \u2013 Then You Are, by Definition, Stupid\nIf You Can\u2019t Find Any Happiness in Solitude \u2013 Then You Are, by Definition, Stupid\n\u201cA high degree of intellect tends to make a man unsocial,\u201d says Schopenhauer, probably trying to find some comfort in the fact that he didn\u2019t have many true friends.\nThe logic goes like this: the more social you are, the more burden you find in your solitude; and the more burden you find living with yourself, the less interesting things \n one can find inside your head.\nSmart people don\u2019t really need company \u2013 they are their own truest and most engaging and most interesting company.\n.\nIf You Need Money or Fame to be Happy \u2013 Then You Are, by Definition, Stupid\nThere are three kinds of needs in life, and only one of these are natural and necessary: those which, when left unsatisfied, cause pain. Of course, we\u2019re talking about food and clothing and stuff here.\nThe problem is not the second category \u2013 natural, but not necessary (those that give pleasure) \u2013 but the third one: both natural and unnecessary (aka luxuries). Because these ones are \nsatisfied.\nIn other words, if you are feeling unhappy because you are not famous like Beyonc\u00e9 or because you don\u2019t have a yacht, you can be absolutely sure that you\u2019ll \nbe happy.\nIf You Are a Nationalist \u2013 Then You Are, by Definition, Stupid \nNational pride, in the opinion of Schopenhauer, is \u201cthe cheapest sort of pride,\u201d because if you are proud of your own nation, then you have no qualities of your own that you can be proud of.\nIn other words, if you have achieved anything \u2013 absolutely \n\u2013 in your life, then it makes much more sense to be proud in that than in your nation, something you share with so many millions of people and something you\u2019ve achieved by, well, being born.\nLet us make this clearer for you: Schopenhauer says that if you take pride in your nation, then you are not merely stupid, but an entirely unaccomplished imbecile.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nThe Wisdom of Life Quotes\nFinal Notes\nis certainly not a major work by Schopenhauer, and nor is it his best-known minor work (which is, arguably, \n).\nBut even so \u2013 perhaps because of its approachableness \u2013 it is still an influential work and one which has made at least a few lives better and more bearable.\n\u201cWith his truths, Schopenhauer gave me a spiritual world and an awareness of happiness,\u201d said once noted Soviet composer, Sergei Prokofiev \u2013 echoing the views of many.\nEchoing not our views, though, because, for the most part, we believe that \nis an outdated manual for happiness, which is not only racist and sexist but also bases some of its findings on these beliefs; the others seem based on Schopenhauer\u2019s own, personal opinions \u2013 and not on objective facts.\nBut, then again, almost all philosophy is.

And Why?\ncovers, yet again, one of the darkest periods of human history \u2013 the Holocaust \u2013 juxtaposing it against the backdrop of one of our most humane traits \u2013 forgiveness.\nIf you wonder if the two are incompatible \u2013 \n you and \nyou forgive a Nazi \u2013 then \nis the book you should read; as its subtitle suggests, it explores the possibilities and limits of forgiveness, and it does that through more than 50 different pairs of eyes.\nAfter finishing the book, you\u2019ll inevitably lend Wiesenthal (if merely in the quiet repose of your thoughts) another; we dare you not to.\nThe Sunflower Summary\nIf you were a Holocaust survivor and were asked by a Nazi soldier on his deathbed for forgiveness, would you have forgotten the way you had been treated, the fate of your close ones, and the smoke above the gas chambers?\nWell, for Holocaust survivor and famous Nazi hunter, Simon Wiesenthal, this was not merely a thought experiment, but an actual real-life experience. \nAfter recounting it in entirety in the first part of the book, he poses this question to no less than 53 people of varied background; unsurprisingly, their answers differ.\nBut in order to understand why \u2013 first you need to hear the story.\nBook One: The Sunflower\nopens in the Janowska concentration camp, where Simon Wiesenthal spent three years of his life \u2013 between the end of 1941 and September 1944 \u2013 working as a forced laborer. At the very beginning, he introduces us to his \u201cclosest companions\u201d: \n and \n.\nJosek is a sensitive and deeply religious guy, a Jew whose \u201cfaith could be hurt by the environment of the camp and by the jeers or insinuations of others, but it could never be shaken.\u201d Unsurprisingly, Simon jokingly calls him \u201cRabbi.\u201d\nUnlike him, Arthur has lost his faith in God, and his attitude to life is ironic. Consequently, Arthur is often \u201cirritated by Josek\u2019s placidity and sometimes he even mocked him or was angry with him.\u201d\nSimon is somewhere in the middle: to Arthur\u2019s \u201cGod has abandoned us\u201d and Josek\u2019s \u201cGod is with us,\u201d Simon prefers the bitterly funny comment by an old woman: \u201cGod is on leave.\u201d \u201cLet me sleep,\u201d Simon replies upon hearing this from Arthur. \u201cTell me when He gets back.\u201d\nNeedless to say, the conditions in the camp are more suited for beasts than for humans. And it is not just the forced labor \u2013 it is also the scarcity of food and the cold-hearted and sadistic treatment at the hands of the SS officers.\nYou know the drill: you work until you can, and when you can\u2019t, you\u2019re shot.\nAt the height of World War II \u2013 and the Holocaust \u2013 Simon is transferred from the Janowska concentration camp to a makeshift hospital set up in the very same Technical School where Simon had previously studied architecture.\nAs Simon travels to his new job, he notices a military cemetery enclosed by a low barbed wire fence. On each grave behind the fence, there is a sunflower, as straight as a soldier on parade.\n\u201cI stared spellbound,\u201d recalls Wiesenthal:\n\u201cSuddenly I envied the dead soldiers,\u201d he adds. \u201cEach had a sunflower to connect him with the living world, and butterflies to visit his grave. For me, there would be no sunflower. I would be buried in a mass grave, where corpses would be piled on top of me. No sunflower would ever bring light into my darkness, and no butterflies would dance above my dreadful tomb.\u201d\nHaunted by these thoughts, Wiesenthal arrives at the makeshift hospital. \nAnd just before he is about to start cleaning medical waste there, a nurse asks him if he is a Jew. After he replies in the affirmative, she carries him to the bedside of a terminally wounded Nazi soldier by the name of \n.\nThe soldier, surprisingly, asks Wiesenthal for forgiveness.\n\u201cI must tell you something dreadful\u2026 Something inhuman,\u201d Karl says. \u201cIt happened a year ago\u2026 a year since the crime I committed. I have to talk to someone about it, perhaps that will help. I must tell you of this horrible deed \u2013 tell you because\u2026 you are a Jew.\u201d\nAnd Karl proceeds to tell his story.\nWe learn that he had been born in Stuttgart twenty-one years before his conversation with Simon. His father had been a convicted Social Democrat, and his mother \u2013 a Catholic. \nThat\u2019s why, neither of them was happy when Karl joined the Hitler Youth, where, by his own admission, his days were full, since he had found both friends and comrades.\nSoon after the beginning of the war, Karl made the next, almost natural, step in his career: he started volunteering in the SS. \nAnd then came the crime.\nOne day, about three hundred Jews were forced into a house. The house was then set on fire. Karl was one of the SS-officers tasked with shooting at those who would try to escape.\n\u201cBehind the windows of the second floor,\u201d he goes on, \u201cI saw a man with a small child in his arms. His clothes were alight. By his side stood a woman, doubtless the mother of the child. With his free hand, the man covered the child\u2019s eyes\u2026 then he jumped into the street. Seconds later the mother followed. Then from the other windows fell burning bodies\u2026 We shot\u2026 Oh God!\u201d\nKarl remained haunted by the sight.\nAnd one day, while fighting in Crimea, this image came back to him: climbing out of the trenches near Taganrog, the memory of the burning family seized him, and he suddenly lost all will to fight. \nAnd then a shell exploded by his side.\n\u201cI lie here waiting for death,\u201d Karl says after recounting his experiences. \u201cThe pains in my body are terrible, but worse still is my conscience. It never ceases to remind me of the burning house and the family that jumped from the window.\u201d\n\u201cI cannot die,\u201d he goes on, \u201cwithout coming clean. This must be my confession\u2026 I know that what I have told you is terrible. In the long nights while I have been waiting for death, time and time again I have longed to talk about it to a Jew and beg forgiveness from him.\u201d\n\u201cI know that what I am asking is almost too much for you, but without your answer, I cannot die in peace.\u201d\nWhile Karl is telling his story, Simon, though disgusted and at times all but determined to leave, holds Karl\u2019s hand and shoos a fly away from his rotting body.\nAnd now, after he is finished, Simon is so taken aback that he doesn\u2019t know what to say. \nSo, he doesn\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cI stood up and looked in his direction,\u201d writes Wiesenthal, at his folded hands. Between them, there seemed to rest a sunflower. At last, I made up my mind and without a word I left the room.\u201d\nThe next day, he returns to the hospital only to find out from the nurse that Karl died in the night.\nSurprisingly, he left him all of his possessions, in addition to his mother\u2019s address. Simon refuses to take anything telling the nurse to send the bundle at the address, to Karl\u2019s mother.\nAfter rejoining his friends at the camp, Simon retells them the story above. All of them are quite happy with the outcome, and even Josek is pretty glad that Simon decided not to forgive Karl \u2013 we can\u2019t forgive sins on behalf of other people, he says to him.\nDuring the next two years, both Josek and Arthur die. \nSo, one night, Simon, still haunted by his experiences with Karl, recounts this same story to a recent inmate, a young Catholic Pole named Bolek.\n\u201cIt is true that you can only forgive a wrong that has been done to yourself,\u201d Bolek says to Simon. \u201cYet on the other hand: whom had the SS man to turn to? None of those he had wronged were still alive.\u201d\nIn other words, in Bolek\u2019s opinion, Simon should have forgiven Karl, as difficult as it seemed to him at the time.\n\u201cHere was a dying man repenting for his sins,\u201d concludes Bolek, \u201cand you failed to grant his last request.\u201d\nSimon is liberated in 1945, and one day, a sunflower reminds him of Karl and his mother\u2019s address. He goes there and, in discussion with her, he realizes that Karl\u2019s mother still believes that her son died an innocent young man.\n\u201cI can well believe what people said,\u201d she says to Wiesenthal, \u201cso many dreadful things happened. But one thing is certain, Karl never did any wrong. He was always a decent young man.\u201d\nSimon doesn\u2019t reveal to her the truth about Karl.\nOnce again, he remains silent, choosing not to diminish her faith in the goodness of her son.\n\u201cThere are many kinds of silence,\u201d concludes Wiesenthal. \u201cIndeed it can be more eloquent than words, and it can be interpreted in many ways.\u201d\n\u201cWas my silence at the bedside of the dying Nazi right or wrong?\u201d Simon asks, before directing this question to the reader of his book:\nBook Two: The Symposium\nIn the second part of Wiesenthal\u2019s book, 53 people \u2013 from writers to architects, from jurists to human rights activists, from Holocaust survivors to former Nazis, from religious to political leaders, from victims of the genocide in Bosnia to victims of the genocide in Tibet \u2013 try to answer this question.\nAnd these are their answers.\n9 of the interviewed people don\u2019t really give an answer, choosing not to say definitely if forgiveness was the right or the wrong thing to do in the situation.\nThese 9 come from very different backgrounds: three of them are Judaists, four Christians (Protestant, Lutheran, Presbyterian, and Roman Catholic), one a Muslim, and one not a religious person.\nIt is the answer of the last one \u2013 Hubert G. Locke \u2013 which we feel that, somehow, sums up the opinion of these nine: perhaps Simon\u2019s silence \n the right answer, if not the only imaginable one. \n\u201cIf God was silent,\u201d writes Locke, \u201cdare any of us speak?\u201d\n34 out of 53 respondents \u2013 which is about 65% of the interviewees \u2013 gave a negative answer to Simon Wiesenthal\u2019s question: in their opinion, you shouldn\u2019t forgive one if he merely repents for his sins.\nInterestingly enough, most of these 34 respondents are Judaists: 19 to be exact. And this makes sense since their \u201cno\u201d is connected to Judaism\u2019s fundamental idea regarding forgiveness, the one uttered by Josek to Simon in the camp.\nNamely, that only those who have been sinned against can forgive the sinners. If one is killed, the perpetrator can never be forgiven \u2013 at least here, on Earth.\nEven a non-religious person such as Bulgarian-French polymath Tzvetan Todorov shares this opinion, summing it up thus:\nPrimo Levi, a Holocaust survivor himself, offers yet another reason: \u201cthe figure of the SS man as portrayed in [Simon\u2019s] book does not appear as fully reinstated from the moral point of view.\u201d\nWhy?\nBecause he\u2019s asking for a Jew to utter his forgiveness \u2013 \n Jew; meaning, even on his deathbed, he still doesn\u2019t think of the Jewish people as anything other than a distinguishable half-human group of people, which is how everything began in the first place.\nAnd then there are the 10 forgivers.\nAlmost unsurprisingly, just like Bolek, most of them are Christians, and the other three are Buddhists.\nAll of them think that though difficult, the answer to Simon\u2019s question is \u201cyes, he should have forgiven Karl.\u201d\nWhy?\nWell, first of all, because forgiveness is the only path toward a more peaceful future, and because it is not the same as forgetfulness.\nAlso, because forgiveness gives peace of mind to the forgiver as well \u2013 and Simon Wiesenthal doesn\u2019t deserve to be haunted by Karl\u2019s memory; forgiving him may have helped him more than not forgiving him.\nThe Dalai Lama retells \u201can interesting incident\u201d to make his point (made in \nas well):\nDesmond Tutu, the coauthor with the Dalai Lama of \n, concurs, reminding the readers of Jesus\u2019s words on the cross \u2013 \u201cFather, forgive them for they know not what they do.\u201d \u2013 and of a similar example to the one offered by Tenzin Gyatso.\nNamely, his very own president: \n.\nIt was him forgiving the whites (who took 27 years of his life) which made South Africa the country that it is today.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Sunflower\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Would You Forgive Your Tormentor If He Sincerely Asked You To?\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judaists Think That There\u2019s a Limit to Forgiveness\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Christians and Buddhists Believe That Forgiveness Is Always the Rightful Path \nWould You Forgive Your Tormentor If He Sincerely Asked You To?\nThe question posed in the title of this lesson is the reason why Simon Wiesenthal wrote and published \n.\nIt is an event which has haunted him to this very day: back in 1943, a terminally wounded Nazi soldier asked him to forgive his sins in the name of all Jews.\nSimon remained silent.\nWhat would you do? \u2013 he asks after telling his story.\nJudaists Think That There\u2019s a Limit to Forgiveness\nMost of Simon\u2019s Judaist friends think that his silence was the best answer possible: under no circumstance, he was allowed to forgive the Nazi soldiers.\nThey offer two reasons: 1) repentance doesn\u2019t mean salvation \n; and, more importantly, 2) nobody is entitled to forgive someone else\u2019s sins.\nChristians and Buddhists Believe That Forgiveness Is Always the Rightful Path\nEven though they acknowledge the difficulty of the situation, most of the Christians and Buddhists asked by Simon Wiesenthal chose a different path: forgiving the Nazi soldier.\nThey too have reasons, at least three of them: 1) forgiving doesn\u2019t mean forgetting; 2) a murderer can\u2019t be forgiven by his victim by definition; and 3) we\u2019ll never attain peace (both individually and as a humanity) unless we learn to forgive each other.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nThe Sunflower Quotes\nFinal Notes\nTouching and thought-provoking, \nis a unique book.\nBoth a memoir and a symposium, it is certainly one of the most haunting books you\u2019ll ever read, not merely because of its story, but also (and maybe even more) because of the question it poses and the differing answers this question instigates among various people.\nIn case you wonder, we still don\u2019t have one. \nBut, we guess, that\u2019s why some books are better than others: when their authors don\u2019t have an answer, they are satisfied with merely posing the right questions.\nAnd Simon Wiesenthal\u2019s question is one of the most difficult you\u2019ll ever have to think about."},

And Why?\nis one of those books \u2013 akin to Daniel Kahneman\u2019s \n or Charles Duhigg\u2019s \nwhich discover and explain things you\u2019ve certainly felt before, but couldn\u2019t really understand the mechanism.\nAnd these books are great because once you understand how something works, it\u2019s fairly easy to use it to your benefit.\nNow, look back at the title of the book.\nThat\u2019s right: this is the book which can help you get better grades!\nDid we pique your curiosity?\nHow We Learn Summary\nPart One: Basic Theory\n\u201cThe science of learning is, at bottom,\u201d writes Benedict Carey, \u201ca study of the mental muscle doing the work \u2013 the living brain \u2013 and how it manages the streaming sights, sounds, and scents of daily life.\u201d\n\u201cThat it does so at all,\u201d he adds, \u201cis miracle enough. That it does so routinely is beyond extraordinary.\u201d\nSo, what will you be able to see if you\u2019re allowed a peek behind the curtains? Who are the protagonists, what are the relations between them, what helps them do a better job and what doesn\u2019t?\nUnsurprisingly, the guys we\u2019re interested in when studying memory are the 100 \n neurons which make up the grey matter of your brain.\nNow, these guys are stimulated constantly. Memories are nothing more but patterns of stimulations. \nTo understand this better, say that you have merely 10 neurons. If an event stimulates three of them in the order 1\u20135\u20138, these three neurons would form a pattern, a network of neurons which are called synapses.\nEach time you\u2019d try to recall that memory, these synapses will be stimulated yet again; that way, they grow thicker; and the thicker they are \u2013 the more you remember something.\nThere\u2019s a twist, though.\nMost of the conscious here-and-now memories are stored by the neurons located in the hippocampus; however, after a while, if they are important enough, they are transferred to the neocortex. \nThat\u2019s why people whose hippocampus is destroyed are still able to remember old stuff, though unable to create new memories.\nWe\u2019ve already introduced you to guys such as \n, an International Grandmaster of Memory and two-time Memory World Record holder, and \n, the 2006 US Memory Champion.\nThere\u2019s an interesting thing science has discovered \u2013 and Benedict Carey wants you to know about them: the \u2018losers\u2019 in these memory competitions stumble not because they remember too little, but because they remember too much. \nIn other words, they are, in a way, much more incapable of \nthe wrong things remembering the right ones.\nWhat does that say about how we learn?\nWell, writes Carey, \u201cif recollecting is just that \u2013 a re-collection of perceptions, facts, and ideas scattered in intertwining neural networks in the dark storm of the brain \u2013 then forgetting acts to block the background noise, the static, so that the right signals stand out. The sharpness of the one depends on the strength of the other.\u201d\nIn other words, remembering, counterintuitively, doesn\u2019t work without forgetting. \nContrary to what your textbooks would have you believe, it\u2019s much easier to remember things than forget them.\nThe problem is your brain stores all kind of information, and the trick is how to teach it to store the \ninformation, the one you\u2019re actually interested in.\n\u201cUsing memory changes memory,\u201d writes Carey, \u201cand for the better. Forgetting enables and deepens learning, by filtering out distracting information and by allowing some breakdown that, after reuse, drives retrieval and storage strength higher than they were originally.\u201d\n\u201cThose are the basic principles that emerge from brain biology and cognitive science,\u201d he concludes, \u201cand they underlie \u2013 and will help us understand \u2013 the various learning techniques yet to come.\u201d\nPart Two: Retention\nYou\u2019ve probably heard this quite a few times, but it\u2019s worth pointing it out again: the surroundings during a study session affect your ability to remember things.\nPossibly the most famous proof of this is the opening scene in Marcel Proust\u2019s \n when the main protagonist suddenly remembers the all-but-forgotten early days of his life after tasting a madeleine, the cookie which on Sunday mornings his aunt gave him when he was merely a child. \nAnd a study by a psychologist named Steven M. Smith has proved this.\nIn 1985, Smith had a group of 54 Psych 101 students study a list of 40 words. The students were divided into three groups: one group studied in silence, another group was listening to Milt Jackson\u2019s \u2018People Make the World Go Around,\u2019 and a third one studied to Mozart.\nThe students spent ten minutes memorizing the words and two days later were asked to retrieve them without a prior warning.\nYou guess what happened!\nIf one studied to Mozart and was asked to recall words while Mozart was once again playing in the background \u2013 he did twice as good as one who studied to Mozart and was asked to recall words in silence or to the tune of \u201cPeople Make the World Go Around.\u201d\nApparently, the music didn\u2019t matter: the same equation held true for the ones who studied while listening to Milt Jackson. But silence did: the ones who studied in silence remembered twice less than the others, regardless of which environment they were asked to remember the words.\nHowever, what this research shows is not that we need to learn with music \u2013 but that we need to change the context if we want to remember the \nitself without \n \n.\nHas your mother ever told you something along the lines of \u201cHoney, don\u2019t you think it would be better to study for a little bit tonight and a little bit tomorrow, rather than trying to learn everything at once?\u201d\nWell, if she has \u2013 then (surprise! surprise!), she was right, and you (chances are) were wrong not to heed to her advice.\nThe technique your mother suggested is called, scientifically, \n or, more commonly, the \n.\nIt means that people learn at least as much \u2013 and retain it a lot longer \u2013 when they distribute (or \u201cspace\u201d) their study time as opposed to concentrating it.\nIn layman\u2019s terms: cramming the night before the exam will probably help you pass the exam as much as spacing out the study material over the week. However, by the time the second semester comes, you\u2019ll probably remember nothing.\n\u201cIn terms of reliability,\u201d Carey uses a nice analogy, \u201cnocturnal sprint is a little like overstuffing a cheap suitcase: the contents hold for a while, then everything falls out.\u201d\nThe lesson?\nIf you want to pass the exam, it doesn\u2019t make any difference whether you\u2019ll cram or space out; however, if you \n want to learn and remember something than cramming is the very, very wrong way to go.\nIt will get you a degree, sure \u2013 but not knowledge.\nHave you ever found yourself in a situation such as this?\nYou\u2019ve just finished reading an interesting book, and your colleagues start a conversation related to the topic this book examines.\nYou feel confident to interrupt them: \u201cBut no \u2013 that\u2019s not the way things are.\u201d \nAnd then you start explaining the things you\u2019ve just learned and, even though at home you felt like you\u2019ve understood everything, suddenly you are unable to clarify even the basic premises.\nStage fright?\nCould be \u2013 but it \n not.\nWhat it is \u2013 a misjudgment of the depth of your knowledge.\nIn other words, you had the right neurons fired up while reading, you did; but the synapses you just formed were too weak and gangling to help you remember the things afterward.\nThe solution?\nIf you want to remember something well, try explaining it to someone else, even if that someone is, well, you.\nTest your knowledge in the silence of your room in any way possible \u2013 because that\u2019s not actually testing, but \n.\nAnd it is not just regular studying \u2013 it is studying \u201cthe high-octane kind, 20 to 30 percent more powerful than if you continued sitting on your butt, staring at that outline. Better yet, those exercises will dispel the fluency illusion. They\u2019ll expose what you don\u2019t know, where you\u2019re confused, what you\u2019ve forgotten\u2014and fast. That\u2019s ignorance of the best kind.\u201d\nPart Three: Problem Solving\nTrue, we live in a distraction-\n world and, as you probably already know, distractions are not helpful if you want to do some \n.\nInterestingly enough, they seem to be a shortcut to a better problem-solving ability.\nYup, we\u2019re talking about \n.\nWe still don\u2019t know why \u2013 but studies have confirmed it over and over again \u2013 taking a break from a project helps you finish that project not merely \n \n but also \n \n.\nFor one reason or another, a period of incubation (a period during which you\u2019re not thinking about a project) makes you \n capable of solving problems.\nA decade ago, a pair of psychologists at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom \u2013 Ut Na Sio and Thomas C. Ormerod \u2013 tried to understand this phenomenon better and their final results are as thus.\nFirst of all, they concluded that the incubation effect is real. However \u2013 and secondly \u2013 it doesn\u2019t always work as expected, because of the circumstances and the distractions included.\nSio and Ormerod divided incubation breaks into three categories:\n\u2022 \n (like listening to music);\n\u2022 \n (like surfing the Internet); \n\u2022 \n (like writing a short essay).\nWell, it seems that as far as math or spatial problems are concerned, you can benefit from either of these three. However, in the case of linguistic problems (such as anagrams), only the second category actually helps.\nAlso, incubation periods seem to work better if they are longer \u2013 i.e., about 20 minutes \u2013 and don\u2019t do the job if they are short (i.e., 5 minutes).\nThe most important thing?\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t benefit from an incubation break unless they have reached an \n.\u201d Or, in layman\u2019s terms: \u201cKnock off and play a videogame too soon and you get nothing.\u201d\nWe guess percolation is not a word you\u2019ve heard before \u2013 not unless you\u2019ve read this book. \nBecause it is a word Carey introduces to describe something usually mixed up with incubation \u2013 namely, to describe longer-term, cumulative thinking processes similar to incubation.\n\u201cTo solve messier, protracted problems,\u201d writes Carey, \u201cwe need more than a \n, a short break here and there. We need an \n.\u201d\nIf you are an artist or a poet, you probably already know what we\u2019re talking about.\n\u201cI have to be alone,\u201d explained once Joseph Heller, \u201cA bus is good. Or walking the dog. Brushing my teeth was marvelous \u2013 it was especially so for \n. Often when I am very tired, just before going to bed, while washing my face and brushing my teeth, my mind gets very clear\u2026\u00a0and produces a line for the next day\u2019s work or some idea way ahead. I don\u2019t get my best ideas while actually writing.\u201d\nThis may have to do a lot with something called the \nafter Russian psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik.\nShe was a student of Gestalt psychologist Kurt Lewin who once noticed that a waiter remembers better the unpaid orders than the paid ones.\nAfter she did a couple of experiments, she realized that this is a natural bias: we tend to remember better things that are not finished than finished ones.\nWhy?\nBecause finishing them is akin to crossing out something on your checklist: a cue for your brain to stop thinking about it anymore.\nThe reverse is true as well: constantly starting something \u201coften gives that job the psychological weight of a goal, even if it\u2019s meaningless.\u201d\nConsequently, interruption pushes the thing you\u2019re interrupting to the top of your mental to-do list.\nAnd that\u2019s percolation at its best!\nHave you ever heard the phrase: \u201cit\u2019s not an adventure until something goes wrong\u201d?\nIf so, you already know that it comes from the world of climbers and hikers, where wrong means \n: \u201ca rope snaps; the food supply flies overboard; a bear crawls into the tent.\u201d\nAnd you know what happens next: suddenly climbers and hikers start to think more clearly and understand things they wouldn\u2019t otherwise.\nWhy?\nWell, because we\u2019re creatures of habit and \n. While that is good for your body and your brain in terms of conserving energy for later, it is not good for your learning capabilities.\nBecause adapting to something puts your brain on autopilot; and you don\u2019t want your brain to be on autopilot if you really want to \n something.\nThe solution?\n.\nInterleaving is a cognitive science word, but it simply means \u201cmixing related but distinct material during study.\u201d\nBasically, it is the reason why your music teacher switches from scales to theory, to pieces all in one sitting; it\u2019s not a bad idea \u2013 but, actually, the \n one.\nInterleaving is \u201cessentially, about preparing the brain for the unexpected,\u201d a \u201cway of building into our daily practice not only a dose of review but also an element of surprise.\u201d\nIt is \u2013 to use an analogy \u2013 a sort of an alarm, a reminder, a cue to signal your brain that it shouldn\u2019t be on autopilot.\nPart Four: Tapping the Subconscious\nis the reason \n.\nNamely, he\u2019s not able to see \n than the other QBs in a shorter time; quite the opposite: he\u2019s able to see \n, aka discern the \nthings in an instant.\nWhen you\u2019re in the pocket, there are so many things happening around you that it is fairly difficult to realize what\u2019s happening even as an outsider watching it on TV.\nThe moment you find out what has \n happened is the slo-mo replay.\nWell, in a way, Brady sees it in slow motion throughout: that\u2019s why, for many sports players, the phrase \u201cthe game has slowed down for me\u201d is practically synonymous with \u201cnow, I make better decisions.\u201d\nThe mechanism underlying this is \n: the ability to see only what it matters. And if there\u2019s such thing as perceptual seeing, there\u2019s also a thing such as perceptual learning.\nAccording to Eleanor Gibson, a pioneer in the field, perceptual learning has three traits:\n\u2022 It is not a passive absorption, but an \n, \u201cin the sense that exploring and searching for perception itself is active.\u201d In other words, \u201cwe do not just see, we look; we do not just hear, we listen.\u201d\n\u2022 It is also \n, \u201cin the sense that modification occurs without the necessity of external reinforcement;\u201d\n\u2022 Finally, it is \n, \u201cwith the goal of extracting and reducing the information simulation.\u201d \nTo sum up, \u201cthe system works to find the most critical perceptual signatures and filter out the rest.\u201d Tom Brady doesn\u2019t need to see everything: he just needs to see the movements of the people who might stop him.\nHe filters out the rest.\nAnd \u201cdiscovery of distinctive features and structure in the world is fundamental in the achievement of this goal.\u201d\n\u201cIf only I could sleep less than three hours \u2013 I would have learned \n more!\u201d\nNow, how many times have you said that before an important exam?\nIf you\u2019re like most of the students \u2013 probably at least three or four times a year. Which is exactly the number of times you were wrong about it!\nWe don\u2019t know a lot about sleeping, but we do know this: it is so intricately related to memory, that it is virtually impossible to consolidate new memories if you remain awake for longer periods of time.\nHowever, as you know full well, there are different phases of sleep, and some of them are more important to certain types of activities than others; even more importantly, sleeping during different periods of the day makes a difference as well.\nFor example, if you are interested in retaining facts and learning vocabulary words, then it\u2019s best to go to bed early in the night; however, if you are a creative person, then you better become a night owl: creative thinking requires REM sleep, and this happens mostly in the morning hours.\nNow that you know this, it\u2019s time to start a \n in your life; which is essentially the same as a studying revolution.\n\u201cI no longer think of naps or knocking off early as evidence of laziness, or a waste of time, or, worst of all, a failure of will,\u201d concludes Carey. \u201cI think of sleep as learning with my eyes closed.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cHow We Learn\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Remembering Is Not the Opposite of Forgetting \u2013 But Its Corollary\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Incubation, Percolation, and Interleaving: Three Concepts to Know If You Want to Solve Problems\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Change the Studying Context and Test Yourself to Remember Better\nRemembering Is Not the Opposite of Forgetting \u2013 But Its Corollary\nWe learn and remember things by creating networks of neurons called synapses; the thicker these synapses are, the more long-term the memory and the easier to recall it.\nHowever, if you want to remember specific things, then the trick is to forget everything else\nForgetting acts as a sort of a background noise blocker, a static, which makes the right signal stand out.\nAs Carey says, the sharper your forgetting, the stronger your memory.\nIncubation, Percolation, and Interleaving: Three Concepts to Know If You Want to Solve Problems\nIncubation, percolation and interleaving are three interrelated concepts which can help you solve problems better.\nIncubation is basically another word for the Eureka effect: we tend to see old problems better after a 20-minute break.\nPercolation is the same, but over a longer period: if you want to write a better novel, then interrupt writing it daily with a long walk or something like it; this will stimulate to think of better ideas.\nFinally, interleaving means mixing things up: don\u2019t learn just theory and then practice, but learn a chunk of theory, then practice it, then another chunk of it.\nChange the Context and Test Yourself to Remember Better\nIf you sometimes forget somebody\u2019s name, go to the place where you met the person, and there\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019ll remember it.\nThe other side of this coin: if you really want to remember \n regardless of the context, then study them in different situations and circumstances, so that they don\u2019t get too attached to a certain set of conditions.\nAlso, once you do learn them, test your knowledge by transforming your mental knowledge into a speech. \nThat is the only way for you to realize whether you know them fluently.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nHow We Learn Quotes\nFinal Notes\n \u2013 to quote a review by \n\u2013 \u201cis more than a new approach to learning; it is a guide to making the most out of life.

And Why?\n is a book by an economist for people who are not interested in economy; also, for people who have had it enough with the discipline, believing (like us) that it\u2019s stopped being a science ever since it proclaimed itself as one.\nFinally, it is a book for all those concerned that economic growth has all but destroyed our planet; this is one of the rare books by economists which prefers the latter to the former.\nIn fact, that\u2019s its main idea.\nDoughnut Economics Summary\nUnfortunately, economics has failed us \u2013 over and over again.\nAs \n demonstrated \u2013 for the thousandth time \u2013 economics is not capable of predicting, let alone preventing apocalyptic events which cause the downfall of corporations and cost thousands of people their homes and even lives.\nAnd you know why is that?\nWell, as \n \u2013 who fervently advocates the cancelation of the Nobel Prize for Economics \u2013 has made it clear on more than one occasion, it is because economics is not actually as scientific as all those equations and graphs would have you believe.\nSimply put, financial crises happen over and over again because our existent economic model (\n) has these crises embedded within it.\nIf you need an analogy to understand, \n: it explains a lot about our world, so we brush away the mistakes by thinking that they are outliers or anomalies.\nBut how many anomalies should we allow before realizing that the \n might be wrong?\n\u201cYou never change things by fighting the existing reality,\u201d Kare Raworth reminds us of Buckminster Fuller\u2019s well-known quote in the introductory chapter of \n\u201cTo change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.\u201d\n\u201cThis book,\u201d she goes on, \u201ctakes up his challenge, setting out seven mind-shifting ways in which we can all learn to think like twenty-first-century economists. By revealing the old ideas that have entrapped us and replacing them with new ones to inspire us, it proposes a new economic story that is told in pictures as much as in words.\u201d\nSo, before we proceed to the words of our summary, here\u2019s its pictorial version, provided by Raworth:\n1. Change the Goal: from GDP to the Doughnut\nRegardless of where you\u2019re living, there\u2019s a good chance that your government\u2019s main economic (and even political) goal is the country\u2019s GDP growth.\nInterestingly enough, it wasn\u2019t always like that.\nIn fact, for most of history, economics wasn\u2019t interested in continual growth but in ways to properly manage the household (which is what the word \n actually means in Ancient Greek).\nConsequently, nobody considered economics a scientific discipline for millennia: it was an art form, more akin to literature than to mathematics. Sure, there are some rules you should follow, but there are many \n goals to achieve as well.\nThis changed with \n, John Stuart Mill, and Milton Friedman who were interested in rationally deducing the laws which govern our economic lives; too bad none of them really cared about (or even knew) \n.\nAnd this left a void where there was none: suddenly, nobody knew what was the goal of economics, even though originally the field was founded mainly with its objective in mind. \nThe result?\nA somewhat invented goal: GDP growth.\nThe problem?\nWell to quote Simon Kuznets, \u201cthe hallowed creator of national income itself,\u201d: \u201cDistinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth, between its costs and return, and between the short and the long term\u2026 Objectives should be explicit: goals for \u2018more\u2019 growth should specify more growth of what and for what.\u201d\nWell, that\u2019s where Doughnut Economics comes in.\nIts name comes from Kate Raworth\u2019s visual representation of its objective:\nAs you can see from the graph, doughnut economics has a pretty discernible goal: to reach the sweet (and safe and just) spot between the social foundation of human well-being and the ecological ceiling of planetary pressure.\nFor all of humanity.\n2. See the Big Picture: from Self-Contained Market to Embedded Economy\nIf you are an economist \u2013 or have seen an economics textbook published in the 20\n century \u2013 you have probably already seen the image below:\nSupposedly, this Circular Flow diagram should explain away macroeconomy; and for many economists out there, it does.\nThe problem?\nIt is utterly and completely wrong.\nAnd there are two reasons why it is wrong.\nThe first one: the market isn\u2019t self-contained, and it isn\u2019t the only economic sector which creates value. Too neoliberal or libertarian to believe that?\nWell, allow Kate Raworth to ask you a question: who cooked Adam Smith\u2019s dinner?\nHer answer:\nIn other words, unpaid household labor creates a lot of value; otherwise, you won\u2019t have Wikipedia.\nThe second problem is even bigger: the economy isn\u2019t a closed system. \u00a0It is \u2013 as Herman Daly first suggested \u2013 \u201can open subsystem of the closed Earth system.\u201d\nAnd it looks something like this:\nIn other words, an economy which constantly grows will one day be brought to a halt when it inevitably overshoots Earth\u2019s regenerative capacities.\nAnd that day is, well, today.\n3. Nurture Human Nature: From Rational Economic Man to Social Adaptable Humans\nAccording to Kate Raworth, the most influential portrait in the history of civilization isn\u2019t Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \n, but the \u201cequally enigmatic yet utterly different character\u2026 the rational economic man.\u201d\nDespite being\n\u201cthe smallest unit of analysis in economic theory,\u201d this \n is such an exaggerated and distorted version of \nthat it\u2019s basically a caricature, if not a cartoon.\nYou know him well: he/she is the \u201csolitary, calculating, competing and insatiable\u201d creature, \n who (to paraphrase John Stuart Mill) desires to possess wealth and luxuries, but deeply disdains work.\nNow, even Mill was aware that his caricature was a caricature, describing his \n of the \n as \u201can arbitrary definition of man,\u201d based on \u201cpremises which might be totally without foundation.\u201d\nFoundations-shmoundations, said just about every economist after him and proceeded to develop a concept of the economy in general with this being as the atomic foundation.\nOf course, everything economics says it\u2019s wrong, because, as we now know full well, humans are \n, social creatures who often make decisions based on a complex network of premises.\nFor example, as both \n, most humans value fairness far above selfishness and are willing to lose things if they see injustice in winning them.\nThe only exception of this group \u2013 economists, influenced by the vision of the rational man from their textbooks.\nSo, let\u2019s influence humanity in a different manner altogether.\nWhat should replace \n?\n\u201cMany new names have been proposed,\u201d writes Raworth, \u201cfrom \n and \n to \n and \n. But it makes no sense to pin ourselves down to just one of these identities: we inhabit them all simultaneously.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s a \n.\n4. Get Savvy with Systems: From Mechanical Equilibrium to Dynamic Complexity\nBut if humans are so complex, then how do market balance themselves?\nWell, the truth is: they don\u2019t. If they did, things such as \n or the financial crisis of 2008 shouldn\u2019t have happened in the first place.\nOf course, hardcore market-believers would say, well, even though they did, after a while, they balanced themselves out. \nHowever, this is wrong on so many levels that we don\u2019t even feel the need to refute it (for one, some people earn a lot of money in the process, and others \n \u2013 and, really, is this what economics should be all about?)\nAnyway, if you think that the market is all about \u201csupply and demand\u201d and believe in the \u201cequilibrium point,\u201d then you\u2019re thinking too simplistic, and you\u2019ll \nhave to deal with bubble-boom-bust cycles.\nThe image you know from your textbooks \u2013\n\u2013 should be immediately replaced by a more complicated one which really shows the inner workings of a complex system (because that\u2019s what the economic system is):\nConfused about those chickens and eggs in the graph?\nWell, the image shows how feedback loops work and uses an analogy to describe it. \nImagine chickens living by the road and laying eggs. More eggs mean more chickens and more chickens mean more eggs. This is the left side of the graph which demonstrates how a reinforcing loop works (R), amplifying what is happening.\nHowever, there\u2019s also a balancing loop (B) on the right side. It works like this: more chickens \u2192 more road crossings \u2192 more deaths \u2192 fewer chickens. The balancing loop counters the reinforcing one.\n\u201cIt is out of these interactions of stocks, flows, feedbacks and delays,\u201d writes Raworth, \u201cthat complex adaptive systems arise: complex due to their unpredictable emergent behavior, and adaptive because they keep evolving over time.\u201d\n5. Design to Distribute: From \u2018Growth Will Even It Up Again\u2019 To Distributive by Design\nWe quoted him above, we\u2019ll quote him again: Simon Kuznets, a guy who won a Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his contribution to the transformation of economics into empirical science.\nAlso: the guy who gave us this:\nAbove you can see the Kuznets curve which suggests \u2013 if it is not obvious enough already \u2013 that as countries get richer, inequality must rise before it will eventually fall. \nIn other words, if you want economic success then you\u2019d better deal with economic inequality because that\u2019s an inevitable stage of it; as for equality \u2013 that should come a bit later.\nIn other words, \u201cdevelopment \n be inegalitarian\u201d (W. Arthur Lewis, also a Nobel Prize winner), so \u201cpoor countries should concentrate income in the hands of the wealthy since only they would save and invest enough of it to kick-start GDP growth.\u201d\nGood news \u2013 for the rich. \nBad news for just about everyone else.\nBecause, you see, even though you can apparently get a Nobel Prize for it and the Kuznets curve is still considered an economic law (so much so that \n), this theory is merely clever, but utterly and dreadfully wrong.\nAnd you know how we know this?\nWell, first of all, because Kuznets himself said that. Both in private correspondence \u2013 \u201cno evidence whatsoever\u201d \u2013 and (well, this is tragic) in the very texts where he introduced the idea, which, in his words, was based on \u201c5 percent empirical information and 95 percent speculation, some of it possibly tainted by wishful thinking.\u201d\nAnd secondly, because when \n.\nThe solution?\nTo start thinking about creating a society where development is \nBecause it \n possible.\n6. Create to Regenerate: From \u2018Growth Will Clean It Up Again\u2019 To Regenerative by Design\nAnother thing mainstream economists are pretty sure will sort out itself with growth?\nThe Earth.\nAnd once again, the problems are created by the very people who believe they\u2019ve discovered a law which demonstrates that they\u2019ll be sorted out.\nIn this case, American economists Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger did a study in the 1990s and supposedly discovered that pollution decreases with growth \u2013 after increasing for a while.\nYou can notice the pattern here, can you?\nIt\u2019s basically the same idea that Kuznets had as far as inequality is concerned.\nIn fact, the graphs are so similar that this one we don\u2019t even need to copy/paste here; you\u2019ll just figure it out via its giveaway name: Environmental Kuznets Curve.\nThe problem with this curve?\nWell, apparently \u2013 and once again \u2013 that even its authors didn\u2019t believe it. Unfortunately, everybody else did \u2013 and by \n we do mean rich people in power \u2013 and soon it was difficult to debate with people that growth might mean serious environmental problems.\n\u201cOf course it does,\u201d they\u2019d say. \u201cBut they\u2019ll sort out themselves in the end.\u201d\nThe logic may be sound on paper \u2013 technological advancements create environmental problems, but if not regulated they also come up with solutions for these very same problems \u2013 but the data doesn\u2019t support it.\nOn the contrary: it seems we may already be near the last return point. (If we\u2019re past it then thanks, \n economists and God help us!) \nAnd maybe we should try to do something before it\u2019s too late.\nAnd that something is quite obvious: transform our linear, caterpillar economy into a circular, butterfly one, shifting from a present filled with disposable products to a future of reusable goods. \nTrue, we\u2019ve already started doing this.\nBut we need to do even more.\n7. Be Agnostic about Growth: From Growth Addicted to Growth Agnostic\nIt all pointed to this, didn\u2019t it?\nAs strange as it may seem at first glance, it\u2019s even stranger how it hasn\u2019t become part of the mainstream science of today.\nBear with Raworth for a second.\nStudies and empirical data have demonstrated \u2013 beyond reasonable doubt \u2013 that, at least so far, \u201cno country has ever ended human deprivation without a growing economy. And no country has ever ended ecological degradation with one.\u201d\nIn other words, if we want a better quality of life for more people, then it\u2019s only smart to devise ways for our economy to grow; however, if we don\u2019t want to destroy the resources which allow it to grow, then we must hinder its growth.\nThe solution?\nWell, that doughnut from the start: finding the right balance. \nBut that all starts with an almost counterintuitive notion: after a certain limit, economic growth is probably not good anymore.\nIn layman\u2019s terms: there should be such thing as \n money.\n, but we seem to have forgotten it.\nSo, Raworth proposes rebuilding our system so that we are constantly reminded that hoarding (especially \n) is not only selfish but, in the long run, detrimental to everybody \nyou.\nAn Argentinian-German businessman by the name of Silvio Gessel \u2013 who lived between the 19\n and the 20\n century \u2013 proposed a solution for this: \u201cwe must make money worse as a commodity if we wish to make it better as a medium of exchange.\u2019\u201d\nMoney, in other words, ages well: unlike most commodities (be they potatoes or smartphones), it \n with time.\nA good way to inspire people not to \n money?\nIntroduce money which \nvalue the longer it is held.\nIt\u2019s called demurrage, and you should really read all about it.\nKey Lessons from \u201cDoughnut Economics\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Economics Has Failed Us Big Time\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seven Ways in Which Economics Is Wrong About the World \u2013 and Seven Ways to Fix This\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Doughnut Economics Is All About Thriving While Preserving the Planet \nEconomics Has Failed Us Big Time\n\u201cEconomics,\u201d to quote Kate Raworth, \u201cis broken.\u201d\nNot only it has failed to predict financial crises which have shaken our society to its very foundations, but it has also shown no interest even to devise ways to prevent these in the future.\nEconomics\u2019 \u201coutdated theories have permitted a world in which extreme poverty persists while the wealth of the super-rich grows year on year. And its blind spots have led to policies that are degrading the living world on a scale that threatens all of our futures.\u201d\nSeven Ways in Which Economics Is Wrong About the World \u2013 and Seven Ways to Fix This\nThere are seven ways in which mainstream economics is fundamentally wrong about the world \u2013 and seven things to do if we want to get back on track:\n#1. Mainstream economists believe that the rise of GDP should be the goal; in fact, it should be the doughnut (wait\u2026 what? See lesson number 3 for more).\n#2. Self-contained markets don\u2019t exist; embedded economy is the real deal.\n#3. The idea of the rational and selfish economic man is utterly wrong; homo sapiens is both the most irrational and \u201cthe most cooperative of all species when it comes to living alongside those who are beyond next of kin;\u201d\n#4. Mechanical equilibrium is possible only in closed and predictable systems; reorient to understand dynamic complexity if you want to understand the market;\n#5. Growth doesn\u2019t bring equality; distribution should be part of the economic systems by design;\n#6. Growth doesn\u2019t solve environmental problems as well; economic systems should be regenerative by design; and, finally,\n#7. Economic systems should not be about never-ending growth \u2013 that is not possible \u2013 but about thriving within limits.\nDoughnut Economics Is All About Thriving While Preserving the Planet\nThe essence of Doughnut Economics is this: to create \u201ca social foundation of well-being that no one should fall below, and an ecological ceiling of planetary pressure that we should not go beyond. Between the two lies a safe and just space for all.\u201d\nIn other words, we are all humans, and we all live on this planet; let\u2019s all live our lives as humans and \ndestroy our planet.\nHow\u2019s that for an objective, economics, ha?\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nDoughnut Economics Quotes\nFinal Notes\nIn our humble opinion, \nis practically \nan economics book for the 21\n century should be: comprehensible, environmentally-friendly, aware of the challenges that lie ahead, interested in solutions which favor humanity as a whole (and not merely a certain group of people).\nAnd unlike most economic books, it is also honest, out-of-the-box enlightening, and prefers images to equations.\nKate Raworth \u2013 thank you.\nThe rest of you \u2013 please read the book."},

And Why?\nIf you enjoyed reading \n\u2013 Ariely\u2019s debut book \u2013 then \nis the book you\u2019ve been waiting for.\nSince we can say pretty much the same thing about Ariely\u2019s other two books \u2013 \n and \n\u2013 it\u2019s safe to say that this is an author it makes a lot of sense to follow.\nIn case you don\u2019t know him, and you need a reason why we\u2019ll give you one: Ariely is a sort of \n/\n mashup.\nConsequently, \nis a perfect gift for psychology and behavioral economics students; but everyone interested in the irrational aspects of human behavior should read it.\nThe Upside of Irrationality Summary\n\u201cThere is a great deal to be learned from rational economics,\u201d writes Dan Ariel in the \u201cIntroduction\u201d to his second book, \u201cbut some of its assumptions \u2013 that people always make the best decisions, that mistakes are less likely when the decisions involve a lot of money, and that the market is self-correcting \u2013 can clearly lead to disastrous consequences.\u201d\nWhy?\nWell, for the simple reason that, despite our biological designation in the hierarchy of species, we are actually \nrational beings.\n\u201cHow else do you explain,\u201d Ariely poses a rhetorical question, \u201cwhy millions of gym memberships go unused or why people risk their own and others\u2019 lives to write a text message while they\u2019re driving?\u201d\nAbout the latter: you wouldn\u2019t expect transportation to work without proper regulation measures, now, would you? After all, despite seat belts, rearview mirrors, antilock brakes, properly designed roads, and a thousand other safety precautions \u2013 people still make all kinds of errors while driving.\n\u201cNow think about \n,\u201d writes Ariely:\nAnd this is where \ncomes in handy; it is a book of experiments which uncover our irrational sides \u2013 and all the downsides and benefits from them in a real-world environment.\nThe book is divided into two parts, each of which contains five different aspects of our irrational behavior.\nPart I: The Unexpected Ways We Defy Logic at Work\nIf you give an electric shock to a rat put in a maze, expectedly, the first thing that would come to that rat\u2019s mind would be \u201cgood lord, they\u2019re going to kill me here: I need to find an escape right now!\u201d\nHowever, if you up the intensity of the shock, the rat doesn\u2019t perform better \u2013 i.e., doesn\u2019t find the escape route faster \u2013 but, on the contrary, struggles much more; after a certain point, it is just too shocked to find the escape route altogether.\nNow translate this into real-world human situations: \n or does stress, after a certain point, hinders your performance?\nOf course it\u2019s the latter!\nInterestingly enough, the same holds true for money bonuses. The bigger they are, the more stress they cause and the more mistakes the person promised to get them is bound to make.\nThere are times when this isn\u2019t true \u2013 when people are tasked with mechanical or manual jobs \u2013 but they don\u2019t get big bonuses to start with; the ones who do get (CEOs and high-level managers) perform much worse with a big-bonus incentive hanging over their heads.\nThe solution?\nIncentivize within the averages.\nIn 1776, in \n seminal economic work, \n,\nAdam Smith \u2013 through a pretty famous pin factory example \u2013 suggested that \u201cdivision of labor is an incredibly effective way to achieve higher efficiency in the production process.\u201d\nThat\u2019s true.\nHowever, it is also inhuman: as Karl Marx argued about a century later in \n, division of labor alienates the workers from their work, demotivating them and making them much less interested not only in their work but in their lives as well.\nFor all this hate of communism around, it turns out that psychological studies prove Marx right.\nIn the one Ariely interprets in his book, two groups of people were paid to build Lego constructions individually; all of them were told they could quit any time they like.\nAfter completing their structures, the people in the first group had them carefully examined by a researcher; the second group wasn\u2019t as lucky: their Lego constructions were dismantled promptly upon completion.\nThe outcome?\nMost of the people in the first group were quite happy to go on working; on the contrary, the majority of people from the second group lost all interest and were more likely to quit building altogether.\nAnd really \u2013 do we value efficiency more than human dignity?\nAs the above two experiments already suggest, we feel much more pleasure when we are creatively engaged than when all we need to do is just manually complete a task.\nThis is called the IKEA effect because, well, the reasons are pretty obvious; however, the effects might not be at this moment.\nTo understand them better, feel free to ponder over this example.\nBack in the 1940s, the home-baking world should have been revolutionized when companies discovered a way to create cake mixes which could magically turn into a cake in no time.\nHowever, this didn\u2019t happen: for some reason, women didn\u2019t want to buy these cake mixes, even though, on the face of it, they saved them a lot of time.\nAnd then Pillsbury realized why: they left out the dried egg from their mixes and marketed their products along the lines of \u201cjust add a fresh egg \u2013 and you\u2019re done.\u201d\nThis made all the difference: the simple effort of adding an egg to the mix was enough to make the housewives think that they\u2019ve prepared the cake altogether.\nNow, you can understand why brands are interested in offering you \n products. \nNamely, you want to feel special, and you want to believe that you\u2019ve made some contribution toward the completion of a product.\nIn other words, we don\u2019t want maximized pleasure for minimum effort: we \nto be involved in one way or another.\nAnd this is true even for animals.\nDon\u2019t believe us?\nFind out more about \n.\nIn a famous Mark Twain essay, \u201cSome National Stupidities,\u201d the great American author describes his utter bewilderment at the fact that the Americans of his day didn\u2019t use German stoves, despite the fact that the latter were ten times better.\nWell, psychologists now know the exact reason why this is happening: for the simple reason that it was not ours.\n\u201cThe attraction to one\u2019s own ideas,\u201d writes Ariely, \u201chas not escaped the collective folk wisdom of the business world, and, like other important business processes, this one also has an unofficial term attached to it: the \u2018Not-Invented-Here\u2019 (NIH) bias. The principle is basically this: \u2018If I (or we) didn\u2019t invent it, then it\u2019s not worth much.\u2019\u201d\nStunningly, this means that even if you have exactly the same idea as someone else, you\u2019d prefer your wording. What does that say about when you have different ideas?\nOf course, there\u2019s a good side to this: strong bias against ideas which come from the outside initiates internal research and development and results in support and reinforcement of the local economy.\n\u201cLike many other aspects of our interesting and curious nature,\u201d concludes Ariely, \u201cour tendency to overvalue what we create is a mixed bag of good and bad. Our task is to figure out how we can get the most good and least bad out of ourselves.\u201d\nHere\u2019s a great game which fundamentally subverts the idea of \n.\nJust called the Trust Game, this one begins with you and a friend of yours receiving $10 each. You are the one making the first move, which can be either keeping the money for yourself or giving it to your friend.\nThe latter one, of course, comes with a twist.\nIf you choose to give the money to your friend, the experimenter will quadruple it and ask the other participant to make the next move: either give you half of it or keep it all for himself.\nSo, in other words, you can either get $10, $25 or none whatsoever; your friend can either get $10, $50 or $25.\nIt is quite rational for your friend to not give you back anything; consequently, it is more than rational for you \nto give him the opportunity to decide for you.\n$10 is not better than $25, but it is certainly better than $0 \u2013 and if we are rational people, that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d get if you decide to give away your $10.\nHowever, the Trust Game usually ends otherwise: with both people getting $25.\nWhy?\nBecause \u201cpeople are more trusting and more reciprocating than rational economics would have us believe.\u201d\nAnd it gets even more irrational!\nNamely, if player A doesn\u2019t receive anything from his friend and is offered the option to for each dollar of his own money, $2 to be extracted from his friend, Player A would almost always spend $25 dollars so that his friend is left with nothing.\nIn other words, even though costly and completely irrational, revenge is just too sweet to be passed by.\nAnd it is sweet because it (sometimes) spells justice.\nPart II: The Unexpected Ways We Defy Logic at Home\n\u201cMan is a pliant animal,\u201d wrote once Fyodor Dostoyevsky, \u201ca being who gets accustomed to anything.\u201d\nApparently, this is more than true: we get accustomed to just about everything, pain included.\nThere are two examples which prove this.\nThe more famous one includes a study of lottery winners. After the initial sense of euphoria, almost all of them revert to the state of happiness they had been before becoming millionaires. \nAnother experiment shows the other side of the coin: even people who lose their legs or end up paralyzed after a car accident, somehow manage to adapt to the new limitations.\nAt this point, it may seem to you that this is something impossible, but, in fact, it is often the \nprobable scenario: \u201cnumerous studies have shown that we adapt more quickly and to a larger degree than we imagine.\u201d\nThis type of adaptation is called hedonic adaptation, and it is the reason why you stop feeling happy about your new shoes only a few days after buying them; it is also the reason why you buy new things constantly: you just fail to recognize your adaptation to the ones you\u2019ve just bought.\nA good way to hack this preprogrammed adaptive bias?\nHedonic disruptions.\nIt\u2019s exactly what it means: whenever you\u2019re feeling happy, find a way to interrupt that happiness so that you \nadapt to it. \nIn other words, calling the one you love constantly will inevitably level out the love. \nAdaptation is also the reason why you feel bored in long-term relationships. So, do something new, something radical to disrupt the pattern.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be an astute observer of human nature,\u201d writes Ariely, \u201cto realize that, in the world of birds, bees, and humans, like attracts like.\u201d\nIn other words, \u201cto a large degree, beautiful people date other beautiful people, and \u2018aesthetically challenged\u2019 individuals date others like them.\u201d\nThis birds-of-a-feather phenomenon is usually referred to by scientists as \u201cassortative mating.\u201d\nNow, it is easy to understand why the 10s date other 10s; what\u2019s more difficult to explain is why do the \u201caesthetically challenged\u201d 5s or 6s settle for other 5s or 6s? Why aren\u2019t they interested in the 10s since, \n, it would be rational for them to prefer the more beautiful ones?\nA great way to understand what happens in the world of aesthetic social hierarchy is if you think of Aesop\u2019s fable \u201cThe Fox and the Grapes.\u201d After the fox is unable to reach the enticing grapes, it walks away mumbling \u201cI\u2019m sure they were sour anyway.\u201d\nWell, this \u201csour grapes\u201d strategy is what regulates the beauty market.\nIn other words, 5s or 6s start attributing more value to non-aesthetic and non-physical qualities, such as kindness or a sense of humor.\nIn addition \u2013 and this is the more interesting part \u2013 they start finding seemingly aesthetically pleasing traits \n.\nSo, next time you see someone rolling his eyes over a picture of Megan Fox or Brad Pitt, be aware that the guy or the girl are not lying: they have merely adapted to a world where they\u2019d never get a Fox or a Pitt.\nOnline dating is a thing for at least two decades now; however, the stats conclusively prove that it doesn\u2019t actually work: very few people meet their romantic partners online.\nBut why shouldn\u2019t it work?\nAccording to a study by Ariely, dating website users spent more than 5 hours a week scanning profiles, almost 7 hours emailing potential partners and about 2 hours a week meeting people face to face.\nSurely, that has to lead somewhere, right?\nWell, guess again.\nThe problem with online dating is pretty fundamental for the market ever to work. \nNamely, we don\u2019t choose partners rationally. And dating sites are rational.\nHowever, checklists, yes/no questions, hair color, and favorite movies don\u2019t mean a thing if when you meet the guy/girl, \n doesn\u2019t click. \nAnd that something is still elusive enough for a dating site to ever work.\nThough Ariely quotes him explicitly, Joseph Stalin never said this: \u201cOne man\u2019s death is a tragedy, but a million deaths is a statistic.\u201d \nOn the other hand, Mother Teresa did say this: \u201cIf I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at one, I will.\u201d\nInterestingly enough, though used to illustrate two very different outlooks on life, both things are thoroughly correct.\nPsychological studies \u2013 and many, many experiments and real-world situations \u2013 prove over and over again that we\u2019re incapable of comprehending large tragedies and are much more likely to empathize with a single person than a group of people (though the latter one is quite evidently worse).\nWhy?\nBecause of something we call the Identifiable Victim Effect, aka you\u2019ll probably donate much more to a 3-year-old starved girl from Mali whose face you can see then to a cause such as \u201cfeed 11 million Ethiopians.\u201d\nMany charities know this and that explains all of those commercials: whether it is Save the Children or Children International, \u201cthe key to our wallets is to arouse our empathy\u201d and \u201cexamples of individual suffering are one of the best ways to ignite our emotions (individual examples \u2192 emotions \u2192 wallets).\nThis is, of course, irrational. \nBut does that mean that being utterly rational \u2013 i.e., a Mr. Spock \u2013 would solve things and make you a better person?\nProbably not \u2013 because then you wouldn\u2019t care about anyone besides the people you can benefit from: it \nirrational to care about someone who lives far away.\nIt is the mixture of these things \u2013 rationality and irrationality \u2013 which makes us human.\nAnd, apparently, humane.\nYou\u2019ve heard this lesson a few thousand times before, worded anywhere between \u201cit\u2019s not healthy to repress emotions\u201d and \u201clet it go when you feel like it.\u201d\nThe problem?\nWell, science says that this is basically the worst thing you can do.\nWhy?\nBecause short-term emotions program long-term decisions, i.e., they tend to transform themselves into a habit.\nAnd why is that?\nFor the simple reason that we are programmed to act in accordance with our past actions. \nThis is called self-herding, and it is the reason why some people start cursing a lot after having cursed once in quite a casual situation. In other words, if you do something once, the next time you\u2019re found in a similar situation, your brain will try to instigate you to repeat that answer \u2013 because it doesn\u2019t know better.\nAnd this is why Ariely suggests that you should try canoeing, start living together or plan your wedding with your romantic partner way before you actually marry.\nJoint behavior in environments that don\u2019t have well-defined social protocols may reveal things that go far deeper than superficial attraction and behavioral precedents which are bound to repeat in the future.\n\u201cIt is worthwhile,\u201d writes Ariely, \u201cto keep an eye open for deteriorating patterns of behavior. When we observe early-warning signs, we should take swift action to correct an undesirable course before the unfortunate patterns of dealing with each other fully develop.\u201d\nChapter 11 \u2013 Lessons from Our Irrationalities: Why We Need to Test Everything\nAriely signs off with a great chapter, one that could be rightly deemed a data-based apology of experimentation.\nOr, to turn that around, a head-on attack on intuition.\nAs these experiments show, Ariely warns, trusting your intuition is not exactly the best thing you can do in many, many situations.\nSo he fervently hopes that you will doubt your intuition and run your own experiments in an effort to make better decisions. \n\u201cAsk questions,\u201d he writes. \u201cExplore. Turn over rocks. Question your behavior, that of your company, employees, and other businesses, and that of agencies, politicians, and governments. By doing so, we may all discover ways to overcome some of our limitations, and that\u2019s the great hope of social science.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Upside of Irrationality\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rational Economics Has Human Nature Figured Out All Wrong\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You Overvalue Your Creations \u2013 and Wouldn\u2019t Trade This Feeling Even for a Hefty Bonus\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You Are Just Too Adaptive to Be Happy\nRational Economics Has Human Nature Figured Out All Wrong\nMany economists today believe that the market regulates things better than external regulators can; the reason being: we are rational enough to make decisions which go our way.\nUnfortunately, this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth: we are just as irrational as rational, and often we do things that defy logic, even if they are detrimental to us.\nJust think of the sheer number of people drinking and driving or driving and texting \u2013 and you\u2019ll understand full well.\nYou Overvalue Your Creations \u2013 and Wouldn\u2019t Trade This Feeling Even for a Hefty Bonus\nApparently, after a certain amount, money can\u2019t buy happiness or inspire you to act smarter and make better decisions. \nIn fact, large amounts of money usually cause just too much stress and people who are promised them are likely to make many more mistakes than people who are promised, say, just a regular bonus.\nThere\u2019s only one exception: manual work.\nThe reason?\nWe enjoy creating things, and this enjoyment is such that we prefer it over money; and when money causes stress, we don\u2019t like it one bit; it makes us hate what we love without it.\nIn manual work, there\u2019s no enjoyment, so the only motivation is money.\nYou Are Just Too Adaptive to Be Happy\nEven if you win the lottery, there\u2019s a high chance that after a while you\u2019ll be no happier than you are at the moment.\nInterestingly enough, the same holds true even if you suffer debilitating injury and remain paralyzed.\nApparently, people learn to adapt to everything, regardless of the amount of pain or happiness attached to it?\nConsequently, your best shot at happiness is somewhat counterintuitive: disrupt it regularly, so it \nbecome a habit. \nIn other words, it is better to spend a week \ncalling your boyfriend/girlfriend than calling him/her every day \u2013 no matter how much you want to.\nIn this latter case, you\u2019d probably just adapt to that level of happiness and stop feeling it altogether.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nThe Upside of Irrationality Quotes\nFinal Notes\nThroughout the years, we\u2019ve come to expect a certain level of quality from Dan Ariely\u2019s books, and \ndoes not disappoint one bit.\nOn the contrary, in fact: this is certainly one of the books we\u2019d suggest to anyone interested in learning how to make better choices.

And Why?\nis a book about everyone ambitious enough to dream of a successful company. \nIt is a book which lays down the essentials of business in a pretty bare, straightforward form \u2013 so it\u2019s best suited for a novice or a future entrepreneur.\nExperienced leaders may consult it as a reminder.\nAbout Wes Berry\n is an American entrepreneur, business expert, and bestselling author.\nAfter turning his family\u2019s 60k florist shop into a $60-million floral, gifts, and plants international business, Berry sold the company to follow other passions and enjoy other endeavors.\nOne of this is \n, a weekly radio podcast of which Berry is the host; the other is sharing his knowledge through the written word, and \nwas the first step in that direction; the book was a \n and \n bestseller.\nFind out more at \n. \n\u201cBig Things Have Small Beginnings PDF Summary\u201d\nIntroduction\n\u201cI chose the title \n for this book,\u201d writes Wes Berry in the very first sentence of it, \u201cbecause I know that I\u2019m living proof of that very truth.\u201d\nEven more, he goes on: \u201cevery successful leader I\u2019ve studied has in some way or another borne out the same truth.\u201d\nAnd the truth is rather simple and straightforward: successful people spend a lot more time and energy on small things that unsuccessful people so often seem to neglect.\nTo illustrate this point, Wes Berry retells a pretty little story you probably already know; but since the moral of that story is \u201cpretty much what this book is about,\u201d we believe it especially worthy of quoting:\nIf it\u2019s not already obvious, here\u2019s what Wes Berry would like you to remember: \u201cwhen you take care of the little stuff, the big stuff has a real nice way of taking care of itself.\u201d\nPart I: Examining the Playing Field\nPart I \u2013 \u201cExamining the Playing Field\u201d \u2013 is the shortest one of the book but it is also the most necessary if not the most important: it sets the tone for what comes next.\nComprised of only three chapters \u2013 \u201cAmbition\u2026 For Better, or Worse?\u201d \u201cThe American Business Climate,\u201d and \u201cYour \u2018Why\u2019 Is a Must-Know\u201d \u2013 the first part begins with a quote by none other than \n:\n\u201cThe person who starts out simply with the idea of getting rich,\u201d noted once the richest man in all of human history, \u201c\n succeed; you must have a larger ambition. There is no mystery in business success. If you do each day\u2019s task successfully, and stay faithfully within these natural operations of commercial laws which I talk so much about, and keep your head clear, you will come out all right.\u201d\nRockefeller\u2019s quote is a more than appropriate for this occasion, and Wes Berry uses it as a springboard to (somewhat unnecessarily) tread a territory already haunted by none other than the messiah of the millennials, \n.\nIf, in combination with that Rockefeller quote, the title of the third chapter of Part I isn\u2019t already a giveaway, let us spell it out for you: you don\u2019t become rich by building a business to become rich; you become rich by building a business that gets you out of bed in the morning (i.e., \n).\nWe know they say that when the going gets tough, the tough get going, but Berry has another idea. In his opinion, when the going gets tough, the ones who have a \u201cwhy\u201d are the only ones who endure:\nDon\u2019t believe him?\nBelieve Viktor Frankl instead: the famous psychotherapist and Auschwitz survivor notes in \n that the ones who survived the Holocaust were not the toughest or smartest, but the ones who had an objective, a goal, a why.\nIt\u2019s that simple.\nAnd what about Berry\u2019s why?\n: a picture of his wife and his four sons on his desk.\nThis picture.\nTo make things a bit clearer, Berry reminds us of an almost half a millennium old essay by William Shakespeare \u2013 ups, pardon us, Stratfordians \u2013 by Francis Bacon, titled simply \u201c\n.\u201d\nIts gist?\nAmbitious people become dangerous if they get their ambitions \n, and not (as common sense often suggests) the other way around; if they are left to roam free \u2013 they become productive and useful.\nSo, if you consider yourself ambitious, then just let your self go. However, don\u2019t forget to use your \u201cwhy\u201d as an orientation, because that\u2019s what ambition is, after all.\n\u201cYour very desire to succeed \n your ambition,\u201d writes Berry. \u201cEmbrace it! Without ambition, your chances of success in business are pretty slim.\u201d\nAnd then he marries this personal \u201cwhy\u201d of ambition with a more universal \u201cwhy\u201d: \u201ctruly ambitious people would rather taste defeat than never have the chance to wear the laurel wreaths of victory. And the best ambitions are not just for oneself, but for an ideal, something greater than the individual.\u201d\nEven though Berry dedicates a whole chapter to explaining this idea, may it be merely a side note in our summary, because it\u2019s not something that needs a lengthy explanation.\nNamely, if you are living in 21\n century USA, consider yourself one of the luckiest people in history: it \n, and this truly is \n.\n And if you are not using the opportunities the Land of the Free gives you, then you\u2019re really looking for an excuse \n to\ndo what is necessary.\n\u201cThe real freedom that American Exceptionalism champions,\u201d concludes Berry, \u201cis \n. Yes, it does take work. But if one is willing to do that work, then that mobility, that position, is waiting for you; it\u2019s pulling for you to reach it.\u201d\nPart II: The Challenge of Leadership\nIf the first part of \nis all about the theoretical framework of becoming \n by finding your \u201cwhy,\u201d the second part (interspersed with many examples taken straight out of Berry\u2019s life: chapter 6 is almost exclusively biographical) is all about becoming \n by putting the \u201cwho\u201d between the \u201chow\u201d and the \u201cwhat.\u201d\nConsequently \u2013 as you might have already deduced (we left you quite a few traces) \u2013 if the first part was haunted by the shadow of Simon Sinek, the second part of Berry\u2019s book is an almost explicit homage to Jim Collins.\nUnsurprisingly, the epigraph is that memorable metaphor from \nin which Collins compares a business leader to a bus driver and a business to a bus.\nHere\u2019s it in full:\nThe main idea of this \u201cwho\u201d in terms of your company is summarized at the very end of Part II, when Berry writes: \u201cIf you want to build a successful company, you\u2019ve got to build successful leaders at every level of that company.\u201d\nIn other words, as someone said once, \u201ca great teacher has always been measured by the number of his students who have surpassed him.\u201d\nWhy should leaders be any different?\nHowever, in order to \n, you need first to become a successful leader yourself. And to do this, you need to follow a few simple steps \u2013 but quite thoroughly and really \n to them:\n. Meaning: know your destination beforehand and divide your journey into many milestones; put target dates and predict bumps on the road; and never forget: no destination is too far if you know where you\u2019re going and how to get there.\n. OK, this one\u2019s pretty self-explanatory. And we have summarized quite a few \n to help you organize yourself.\n. Always be in step with innovation; analyze other leaders and emulate them; read, read, read.\n. It\u2019s all about gaining perspective \u2013 and having an open mind to gain one.\nPart III: Seeking Out That Needle in the Haystack\n\u201cYou may not know of Elbert Hubbard,\u201d writes Berry in Chapter 12 (second of Part III), \u201cbut I could not have written this book if he had not existed.\u201d\nOh, but \n, Wes, and we \n; which, in other words, means that we already know many of the things you say in Part III \u2013 but thanks for reminding us, because every generation should remind the next one of Andrew S. Rowan.\nIn case you don\u2019t remember him, check out the summary linked above; here, a three-sentence summary, just so that we can put this summary to bed.\ntells the partly fictional story of the quite real American army officer Andrew Summers Rowan, who, just prior to the Spanish\u2013American War, was tasked with carrying a message from President William McKinley to the Cuban insurgents\u2019 leader, General Calixto Garc\u00eda.\nIt was a daring escapade, but Rowan just said \u201cYes, sir\u201d and, after a self-driven effort through the mountain vastness of Cuba, he eventually \ndeliver the message to Garcia.\nThe point?\nWell, let us allow Hubbard to tell it: \n\u201cThe point I wish to make,\u201d he writes, \u201cis this: McKinley gave Rowan a letter to be delivered to Garcia; Rowan took the letter and did not ask, \u2018Where is he at?\u2019 By the Eternal! there is a man whose form should be cast in deathless bronze and the statue placed in every college of the land.\u201d\nAnd he goes on\u201d \u201cIt is not book-learning young men need, nor instruction about this and that, but a stiffening of the vertebrae which will cause them to be loyal to a trust, to act promptly, concentrate their energies: do the thing \u2013 \u2018Carry a message to Garcia!\u2019\u201d\nIn other not-so-kind words (once again by Hubbard), Rowan is an antidote to \u201cthe imbecility of the average man \u2013 the inability or unwillingness to concentrate on a thing and do it.\u201d\nWes Berry takes it from here and says: find a few Rowans, manage them well and keep each one of them long enough under your wings, and you\u2019ve built yourself a successful business?\nBut how will you find a Rowan?\nBerry suggests that you look for these four traits:\n\u2022 focus\n\u2022 perseverance\n\u2022 research-oriented mind\n\u2022 submissiveness to orders\nNow, after you\u2019ve found a Rowan, it\u2019s your job to mentor him well so that he doesn\u2019t burn out in his drive; this you\u2019ll achieve by finding a balance between the freedom you\u2019ll allow him and the orders you know he\u2019ll respect.\nIt\u2019s, once again, pretty simple on paper, but a bit difficult in practice.\nThe good thing?\nIt\u2019s not that difficult when you\u2019ve surrounded yourself with Rowans.\nConclusion\nThe \u201cConclusion\u201d of \nis basically a highly personal commentary on the margins of \u201cFor Want of a Nail\u201d and Rudyard Kipling\u2019s \u201cIf.\u201d\nAnd it ends with an inspiring quote:\nKey Lessons from \u201cBig Things Have Small Beginnings\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the Going Gets Tough, the Why Gets You Going\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How to Become a Leader in Four Steps\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Four Traits of a Rowan\nWhen the Going Gets Tough, the Why Gets You Going\nA page taken out of Simon Sinek\u2019s book; but, then again, it\u2019s the most important page.\nThe idea is simple: you shouldn\u2019t spend most of your quite limited time on this planet doing things you don\u2019t want or have no desire for.\nIf, on the contrary, you do something you really like, then you\u2019ll always have a \u201cwhy\u201d to return to when, inevitably, things should go haywire.\nLet us rephrase this: if you struggle to find an answer to the question \u201cwhy you are doing this?\u201d then, by all means, don\u2019t do it.\nHow to Become a Leader in Four Steps\nLeaders are made, not born.\nYou can become one if you just follow these four simple steps:\n#1. Map the journey of your company from start to finish, bumps and everything;\n#2. Manage your time well;\n#3. Know your working tools: innovate, learn from other successful leaders, and never, ever stop being curious, reading quite about everything:\n#4. Listen and learn: understand the others and see the world through their perspective; there\u2019s a lot of empathy in business.\nThe Four Traits of a Rowan\nA successful company, according to Wes Berry, is a company built around Rowans. And a Rowan is a guy who is capable of delivering a message to Garcia without asking too many questions. And \nis a book by Elbert Hubbard \n.\nAnyway, a Rowan has four traits; these:\n\u2022 focus\n\u2022 perseverance\n\u2022 research-oriented mind\n\u2022 submissiveness to orders\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cBig Things Have Small Beginnings Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nis a sort of a Sinek/Collins/Hubbard mashup \u2013 so it should appeal to just about everyone who\u2019s interested in discovering his/her why, becoming great, or finding a Rowan to lead his company.\nWith that being said, the book doesn\u2019t really offer anything quite new in any area \u2013 so, if you feel like you\u2019ve already absorbed everything those three guys can offer, then this book may feel a bit redundant.\nBut, hey, repetition is the mother of knowledge, right?"},

And Why?\nis about everyone who believes that his/her problems will disappear by themselves. As you\u2019ll find out in this book, even therapists need therapists.\nRead this book to find out whether you need one yourself. Read it also if you merely want to find out how therapy works in practice: as we implied above, it is a unique book in that it is written from both the perspective of a therapist and a patient as well.\nAbout Lori Gottlieb\n is a bestselling American writer and a popular psychotherapist.\nShe is most famous for her weekly \u201cDear Therapist\u201d advice column which she writes for \n, where she is also a contributing editor. \nShe has written for \n and makes regular TV appearances, whether on \n, \n,\n, CNN, NPR, etc. \nGottlieb has authored and co-authored a few more books, including \n and \n.\nFind out more at \n. \n\u201cMaybe You Should Talk To Someone PDF Summary\u201d\n is a book which asks, \u201cHow do we change?\u201d and answers with \u201cIn relation to others.\u201d\nAuthor\u2019s words\u2014not ours.\nBut it\u2019s difficult to say much more than that: a unique type of memoir, \nis an exceptional book by an exceptional therapist about the nature of the relationships with her patients, but also a book about her own relationship with her own therapist, i.e., a chronicle of how she became a patient herself. \nThe goal?\nTo reveal our shared humanity so that we can see ourselves more clearly.\nThroughout the book, Gottlieb zig-zags between her experiences with her therapist Wendell, and the experiences of four of her patients (John, Rita, Julie, Charlotte) with \n as the therapist. \nWe\u2019ll mainly focus on Lori in our summary, but we\u2019ll mention some of her patients as well.\nWhat Lies Beneath the Presenting Problem\n\u201cIt all starts with a presenting problem,\u201d says Lori Gottlieb.\nAnd a presenting problem, by definition, is \u201cthe issue that sends a person into therapy.\u201d\n\u201cIt might be a panic attack, a job loss, a death, a birth, a relational difficulty, an inability to make a big life decision, or a bout of depression,\u201d writes Gottlieb. \u201cSometimes the presenting problem is less specific\u2014a feeling of \u2018stuckness\u2019 or the vague but nagging notion that something just isn\u2019t quite right.\u201d\nThe problem with the presenting problem?\nWell, it\u2019s not the \n problem!\nWe can illustrate this with quite a few of Lori\u2019s patients\u2019 stories, but you know this already from one of our recent summaries. \nAllow us to remind you of that one once more.\nIf you remember well, \n she merely wanted to talk to him about her frustration with the election of Donald Trump.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t care about inflection points when they come for their first therapy session,\u201d inform us Gottlieb. \u201cMostly, they just want relief. They want to tell you their stories, beginning with their presenting problem.\u201d\nHowever, they end up somewhere else after a few months\u2014namely, they end up finding out that their problem was merely the first layer, the curtain under which something much darker lies buried.\nFor Chelsea, the real problem was the never-gotten-over death of her beloved 22-year-old brother Chet when she was just 9.\nTrump\u2019s election merely repeated the sequence: things were going great, and then\u2014boom!\u2014the whole world was out of its joint.\n that \u201cPeople will do anything, no matter how absurd, to avoid facing their own souls.\u201d\nBut he also said this: \u201cWho looks inside, awakes.\u201d\nThe Interesting Paradox of the Therapy Process\nWe\u2019ve already talked about \n and how much energy our brain spends to rationalize our irrational behavior.\nThe result?\n and that the whole world is to blame for our misfortune; everyone\u2014but us.\nThe interesting bit?\nWell, even if you know this, there\u2019s no way you can prevent it. It\u2019s just the way we\u2019re built.\nTake it from the author of this book.\nShe\u2019s a well-known psychotherapist\u2014in fact, she writes the weekly \u201cDear Therapist\u201d advice column for The Atlantic\u2014and, yet, she wasn\u2019t able to help herself when she faced a serious problem. On the contrary: when she went to a psychotherapist, she did precisely what she had advised all of her patients not to do\u2014i.e., lied to herself to look better in her story.\nAnd, as she informs us, that\u2019s the interesting paradox of the therapy process:\n#1. Death: \u201cLet Me Fill You In On the Boyfriend Incident\u2026\u201d\nWhat was Lori Gottlieb\u2019s problem, you ask?\nOne of the most common ones: A Boyfriend.\nThe guy we\u2019re talking about here\u2014for obvious reasons, Lori refers to him as nothing more but the Boyfriend\u2014was going out with our therapist for two years, and then, out of the blue, put an end to their relationship, just around the time when Lori was making plans for a wedding.\nThe reason?\nWell, Gottlieb had an eight-year-old child, and the Boyfriend deemed this an unnecessary complication in his life. It was a problem he had never mentioned before, so, of course, in Lori\u2019s eyes, all of this made the Boyfriend either selfish or a liar\u2014or both!\nAnd that\u2019s what she wanted her psychiatrist\u2014a certain Dr. Wendell (of course, his name is changed too)\u2014to confirm. She felt life would be a lot easier of someone as qualified would back up her story.\nHowever, Dr. Wendell wouldn\u2019t admit that the Boyfriend was a sociopath.\nHe just listened and listened, picking up cues. After all, he did know that the Boyfriend was actually the presenting problem. The only way he could reach the real problem was \n.\nAnd one day, he picked up the real cue: Lori said that her life was half over.\nWendell realized: the frustration over her ex-boyfriend was merely an external symptom which masked something rooted deep within Lori\u2014her pretty tangible fear of death.\nYou see, Lori was already in her late 40s, and, not that long before her therapy session, had begun experiencing a mysterious illness which none of her doctors could diagnose.\nThe Boyfriend\u2014and the imagined future built around him\u2014served as a kind of curtain covering this fear. His going away left Lori to face the fear alone.\n#2. Isolation: The Importance of Human Connection\nWendell told Lori that, with the loss of her Boyfriend, she had lost more than her relationship in the present: she lost her relationship in the future as well. \n\u201cWe tend to think that the future happens later,\u201d he went on, \u201cbut we\u2019re creating it in our minds every day. When the present falls apart, so does the future we had associated with it. And having the future taken away is the mother of all plot twists.\u201d\nUnfortunately, if we spend the present trying to fix the past or control the future, \u201cwe remain stuck in place, in perpetual regret.\u201d\nLori couldn\u2019t do anything else but Google-stalking her Boyfriend because she felt that her life had ended. Moreover, that, due to her age, she would never find another partner to be with her.\nThere\u2019s nothing worse than loneliness, is there? \nThat\u2019s why the worst kind of punishment is solitary confinement.\nUnfortunately, sometimes, we pass this judgment upon ourselves, by being not open enough to meet new people, by treating poorly the ones who are around us, or, simply, by being afraid that we won\u2019t be accepted.\nThat was the story of Rita, a divorced patient of Lori who came to her expressing regret over her \u201cbad choices\u201d and a life poorly lived. She even thought about ending it if she doesn\u2019t find a way to better it through her therapy sessions.\nIn a way, it was the therapy sessions themselves that did the trick: Rita needed someone to talk to. She had been isolated for a decade, coming to the point of splurging on pedicures just so that she could feel some human touch.\nIt came from a woman named Connie who didn\u2019t speak \u201ca lick of English;\u201d but her touching her feet was enough to keep her alive.\n#3. Meaning: Happiness Is an Abnormal Condition\n starts with an eye-opening epigraph, which has haunted us ever since we opened it for the first time:\nBefore you scoff it off, let us tell you that this is not merely a philosophical rumination over the nature of happiness.\nOh no!\nIt\u2019s the author\u2019s abstract of \u201c\n\u201d by Richard P. Bentall, a Professor of Clinical Psychology, published in the Journal of Medical Ethics in 1992.\nWhat does this tell us?\nWell, something \n, \n, \n\u2014and many others\u2014have been telling us all along: that it\u2019s pointless to make happiness your objective in life.\nWhy?\nFor the simple reason that nobody ever has been permanently happy. Happiness, in other words, is temporary, has a lot to do with your biology, and is, thus, all but unattainable.\nWhat you should strive for, instead?\nMeaning.\nWe get nothing out of \n things, and, as Frankl so memorably told us, it is only when we find some meaning that we can fight through things.\nThat\u2019s why guys like \n or \n sound so conservative at times: religion, for example, offers pre-packed meaning and, even if wrong, \n.\nLori experienced this herself.\nDuring her therapy sessions with Wendell, she realized that her Boyfriend was not merely a way to hide her fear of death from herself, but also a great distraction from something which had made her anxious for a while.\nNamely, Lori had a book deal with a publisher to write something on the subject of helicopter parenting. She felt utterly disconnected from the topic, and every time she would sit down to write something, she felt uneasiness that struck her to her very core.\nBecause, you see, Lori had received an advance for that book. Moreover, she had already spent it. And the fact that she was obliged to return the money wasn\u2019t the most frightening part. It was the fear that, in the future, she wouldn\u2019t get another deal (at least that\u2019s what her agent had told her).\nHowever, through her therapy sessions with Wendell, Lori realized that all of this was, once again, just a complex distraction.\nThe real problem was that Lori didn\u2019t \nwrite that book: she found the work meaningless and \n to write something else.\nEncouraged by her therapist, she returned the advance and started writing this other book.\nIts title:\n#4. Freedom: Unstuck Yourself\nAccording to the person-centered approach to therapy, there are four reasons why one seeks the help of a professional. \nWe went over three of them\u2014death, isolation, meaning in life\u2014so it\u2019s time to round things up with the fourth one: lack of a sense of freedom.\nThat\u2019s precisely what Lori felt due to her book deal and the advance that came with it. Simply put, she wanted out of it, she wanted to find a way to \n.\nTrue, it seemed complicated, but Lori \nhave a choice; unfortunately, a patient of hers named Julie didn\u2019t.\nA thirty-three-year-old university professor diagnosed with cancer upon returning from her honeymoon, Julie was objectively trapped in her situation.\nIn a way, there was no way out of it: she had no choice but to face the inevitable.\nHowever, \nto do that is an entirely different matter.

Embracing the new kind of freedom meant living to your last breath.\nAnd she did just that!\nShe started risking the way she had never risked before, for the simple reason that she had nothing to lose. And she learned that switching from professorship to being a cashier was a great decision at that time in her life: she craved for social contact, and as a professor, she barely had one.\nIf that sounds like another version of the plot of Ricky Gervais\u2019 \n, it\u2019s because it is. \n, but it\u2019s also what makes life worth living.\nSo, no matter how painful it is\u2014rip off the band-aid sooner rather than later.\nKey Lessons from \u201cMaybe You Should Talk To Someone\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Presenting Problem Is Merely a Curtain for the Real Problem\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We Rationalize Too Much to Be Able to Trust Ourselves\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There Are Four Reasons Why People Go to Therapy \nThe Presenting Problem Is Merely a Curtain for the Real Problem\nWhen someone goes to a therapist, usually, the first question that he/she hears is the one Lori Gottlieb considers the best ice-breaker out there: \u201cSo, tell me what brings you here today?\u201d\nHowever, Lori\u2014and all good therapists, in fact\u2014are aware that the answer to this question is never the answer to the real question: what is \ntroubling the patient?\nThe answer to the question above is always something therapists refer to as \u201cthe presenting problem.\u201d The \u201creal problem,\u201d however, lies much deeper, and can be unearthed through hours and hours of discussion.\nWe Rationalize Too Much to Be Able to Trust Ourselves\nThe reason why therapists need hours and hours to unearth the \nproblem underneath the \n problem is simple: as a species, humans are exceptionally good at lying. \nAnd, \n, the easiest person to fool is yourself.\nUnfortunately, even if you know this, there\u2019s no way around it without the kind and carefully directed words of another person.\nPut otherwise, when you go to a psychotherapist, you\u2019re already prepacked with a narrative which gives an explanation about all of your decisions, making you a nice person in his/her eyes.\nIt is his/her job to dig around these stories and, like a modern Sherlock Holmes, pick up a clue which would redirect the discussion to a territory you\u2019ve never trodden before.\nBecause, let\u2019s face it, that\u2019s the only territory you\u2019d want to go if you want to sort out your problems.\nThere Are Four Reasons Why People Go to Therapy\n, there are four ultimate concerns, i.e., four givens of existence: death, isolation, meaning in life, and freedom.\nIn a way, all of your problems, frustrations, and anxieties boil down to one\u2014or even all\u2014of them. \nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cMaybe You Should Talk To Someone Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nhas already earned enormous amounts of both critical and popular acclaim.\nKatie Couric has called the book \u201cabsorbing,\u201d and Susan Cain \u201cwise,\u201d \nmagazine went with \u201caddictive,\u201d and \nwith \u201cirresistible;\u201d \ndescribed the book as \u201cheartwarming,\u201d and \n used an adjective you don\u2019t see thrown around very often \u201csearing.\u201d\nis all that\u2014and maybe even more!\nRead it before everyone starts talking about: the book is currently being developed as a TV series with Eva Longoria and ABC!"},

And Why?\nWell, it is difficult to answer these questions because we feel that, even though written primarily for Christian audience, non-religious readers might find this book much more appealing than Christians; in fact, some Christians may even be offended by Donald Miller\u2019s beliefs.\nRead it if you think that faith is necessary, but that institutionalized religion has made it seem unfashionable for our atheist, postmodern times.\nAbout Donald Miller\n is an American religious writer, public speaker, and business owner.\nEven though he made his name as an unconventional advocate for faith in our times, Miller is now much more sought-after as a brand maker, being the CEO of StoryBrand, a company which helps businesses clarify their missions and messages.\nIn fact, his last book is titled \n and is pretty different from the books with which he made his name: \n, \n, and \n\u201cBlue Like Jazz PDF Summary\u201d\nSemi-autobiographical and hugely popular, Donald Miller\u2019s second book, \n, is basically a collection of essays on the nature of God and Christianity.\nThere\u2019s a sort of a narrative there, since most of these essays chronicle Miller\u2019s personal experiences and the experiences of several of his friends \u2013 Mitch, Penny, Laura \u2013 all of them students at the liberal arts Reed college in Portland, Oregon, and all of them trying to understand their purpose being here and, consequently, their belief in something larger than human life.\nAfter a more than successful Kickstarter campaign, \nwas adapted into a movie by director Steve Taylor in 2012. If you haven\u2019t watched it yet, here\u2019s a trailer to pique your fancy:\nAuthor\u2019s Note\nFirst of all, let\u2019s get one thing straight: this book barely mentions jazz.\nThen, why the title?\nWell, it\u2019s the arch-metaphor of the book, and it\u2019s kind of difficult to understand it if you skip the author\u2019s note.\nWe won\u2019t allow that.\nHere\u2019s it in full:\nSo, in a way, Donald Miller says that God is like jazz because neither of them resolves, because neither of them is a well-rounded story with an ending; both of them go on, and go on \u2013 and it\u2019s your job to build a relationship toward them.\nMore importantly, this author\u2019s note implicitly uncovers Donald Miller\u2019s belief that maybe seeing (or, in this case, reading about) his unique kind of love for God may make you love God as well.\nJust like he fell in love with jazz after seeing somebody lovingly play it.\nChapter 1 | Beginnings: God on a Dirt Road Walking Toward Me\nIn the first chapter of \n, Donald Miller takes us on a guide through selected events from his childhood, all framed with (surprise! surprise!) quite a few daddy issues (his dad left him when he was young).\nConsequently, you can understand why for Miller, the concept of \n was a strange one: it both signified something which he lacked, and something of which he had a pretty different understanding than most of the other people.\n\u201cWhen I was introduced to the concept of God as Father,\u201d he writes, \u201cI imagined Him as a stiff, oily man who wanted to move into our house and share a bed with my mother. I can only remember this as a frightful and threatening idea.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why when he heard an Indian talking about the pantheistic nature of God, he realized the beauty of such a concept: if God was everywhere, he could swim in Him or have Him brush his face in a breeze.\nAnd in a way, that\u2019s what eventually happened.\n\u201cYears ago,\u201d writes Miller, God \u201cwas a swinging speck in the distance; now He is close enough I can hear His singing. Soon I will see the lines on His face.\u201d\nChapter 2 | Problems: What I Learned on Television\nIn this chapter, Donald really introduces to us for the first time. \nUnlike many other religious people, Donald is just like you, an average Joe. \nMeaning: he likes to be cool, he is not that uninterested in science (the chapter begins with his friend\u2019s note that light exists outside of time), he cusses, he drinks, he smokes \u2013 and he wants to have sex when given the chance.\nAlso, he\u2019s \na Republican. In fact, in this chapter we see him joining his friend \n on an anti-Bush rally; they have their reasons.\nFurther down the chapter, Donald informs us that, in his opinion, Christians are right: we have a sinful nature since it is much easier to do bad things than good ones.\n\u201cAnd there is something in that basic fact,\u201d he concludes in discussion with his friend \n, \u201csome little clue to the meaning of the universe.\u201d\nChapter 3 | Magic: The Problem with Romeo\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t give myself to Christianity,\u201d writes Miller in chapter 3, \u201cbecause it was a religion for the intellectually naive. In order to believe Christianity, you either had to reduce enormous theological absurdities into children\u2019s stories or ignore them.\u201d\n\u201cThe entire thing,\u201d he goes on, \u201cseemed very difficult for my intellect to embrace. Now, none of this was quite defined; it was mostly taking place in my subconscious.\u201d\nHowever, the reason why Miller believed this were watered-down children\u2019s Bibles which think that the essence of religion is the story; during his literature classes at Reed college, Donald Miller realized that it is not.\nOr, at least, that this is merely the beginning.\nThere\u2019s Copperfield saying that nothing is magical, and there\u2019s Copperfield doing a trick nobody can explain. And everybody remains silent and awestruck for a while.\n\u201cI had always hated hearing about it because it seemed so entirely unfashionable a thing to believe, but it did explain things,\u201d concludes Miller. \u201cMaybe these unfashionable ideas were pointing at something mystical and true. And, perhaps, I was judging the idea, not by its merit, but by the fashionable or unfashionable delivery of the message.\u201d\nChapter 4 | Shifts: Find a Penny\nIf you remember well, Reed College is a liberal arts college. And that means, well, read between the lines: drugs, alcohol, atheism \u2013 you name it. (\u201cSome of the Christians in Portland talk about Reed College as if it is Hades.\u201d)\nIt\u2019s highly unfashionable to be a religious person among the artists of today; if not because of something else, because of the fact that religion bans about 90% of the things artists do.\nIn Chapter 4, Donald introduces us to two of his closest friends, who, in a way, seem like two very opposite sides of the same coin:\n\u2022\n, the anti-religion \u201cI can do what I want\u201d student who is too smart for her own sake, barely capable of finding a class challenging enough for her intellect; and\n\u2022 \n, a devout Christen who believes that God once spoke to her.\nChapter 5 | Faith: Penguin Sex\nWell, this one was kind of expected: Laura falls into a severe state of depression.\n\u201cBoy stuff?\u201d \u2013 Don asks. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cSchool stuff?\u201d Another \u201cno.\u201d \u201cGod stuff.\u201d \u201cI guess so, Don,\u201d she says. Because, we guess, these are the only three reasons one might fall into depression, ha?\nAnyway, this whole chapter consists of two attempts to convert Laura into a believer. The first attempt fails: \u201cIf God is real, He needs to happen to me,\u201d says Laura to Don, who can\u2019t explain his faith because, well, it is, by definition unexplainable.\n\u201cMy belief in Jesus did not seem rational or scientific, and yet there was nothing I could do to separate myself from this belief.\u201d\nBut then, in another discussion, Tony asks Don why does he believe at all, and Don starts talking about penguins and their mating rituals.\n\u201cThey have this radar inside them that told them when and where to go, and none of it made any sense,\u201d he says, \u201cbut they show up on the very day their babies are being born, and the radar always turns out to be right. I have a radar inside me that says to believe in Jesus. Somehow, penguin radar leads them perfectly well. Maybe it isn\u2019t so foolish that I follow the radar that is inside of me.\u201d\nOf course, this somehow gets to Laura and, after some time, she sends Don a message:\n\u201cI read through the book of Matthew this evening,\u201d it says. \u201cI was up all night. I couldn\u2019t stop reading so I read through Mark. This Jesus of yours is either a madman or the Son of God. Somewhere in the middle of Mark, I realized He was the Son of God. I suppose this makes me a Christian. I feel much better now.\u201d\nChapter 6 | Redemption: The Sexy Carrots\n\u201cI found myself trying to love the right things without God\u2019s help,\u201d notes Don in this chapter, \u201cand it was impossible.\u201d\n\u201cI tried,\u201d he goes on, \u201cto go one week without thinking a negative thought about another human being, and I couldn\u2019t do it. Before I tried that experiment, I thought I was a nice person, but after trying it, I realized I thought bad things about people all day long, and that, like Tony says, my natural desire was to love darkness.\u201d\nIn a way, nothing helps Don makes sense of his life \u2013 or, even better, the ethical structure of the universe \u2013 in the absence of Jesus.\nNot even rigorous self-discipline.\nChapter 7 | Grace: The Beggars\u2019 Kingdom\n\u201cI was a fundamentalist Christian once,\u201d starts chapter 7. \u201cIt lasted a summer.\u201d \nWhy?\nBecause, in the eyes of Don, self-discipline is almost impossible when there isn\u2019t a goal behind it. It just makes you unhappy. After all, how can you be happy when you\u2019re renouncing all of the worldly pleasures, and there\u2019s no transcendental reason behind it?\nIt\u2019s difficult even when there is: Don\u2019s pastor Rick, \u201canguished by an inability to control his desires,\u201d one evening \u201cswallowed enough muscle relaxants and sleeping pills to kill three people.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t die, of course, but he understood one important thing: God is not a loan shark, and he doesn\u2019t ask anything in return but purity and humbleness.\n\u201cYour life is not your own,\u201d Rick heard God speaking to him at that moment, \u201cbut you have been bought with a price.\u201d\nChapter 8 | Gods: Our Tiny Invisible Friends\nIn this chapter, Don tells the story of a guy named \n, who Don believes offends everything sacred in this world because he uses \u201cIslamic verbiage to make himself look spiritual, and yet he really hasn\u2019t researched or subscribed to the faith as it presents itself.\u201d\nIn other words, he\u2019s using the Koran to make himself trendy and popular, and that, in itself is a reason enough to believe that he\u2019s faking it.\nWell, Tony, Don\u2019s friend, states the obvious: just like this Trendy Christian Writer, we are raping our faith as well. We\u2019re believing only to the point it suits us.\n\u201cWhen Tony said that,\u201d Don writes, \u201cit was as if truth came into the room and sat down with us. I felt as though Jesus were gently holding my head so He could work the plank out of my eye. Everything became clear.\u201d\nTo be more precise, Don \u201crealized in an instant that [he] desired false gods because Jesus wouldn\u2019t jump through [his] hoops, and [he] realized that, like Tony, [his] faith was about image and ego, not about practicing spirituality.\u201d\nChapter 9 | Change: New Starts at Ancient Faith\nIn chapter 9, Don relates us a sort of a religious experience in the Grand Canyon. \nUnder the stars, he starts feeling what that Indian from the first chapter talks about and he starts talking to God:\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, God,\u201d he shouts to the sky. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I got so confused about You, got so fake. I hope it\u2019s not too late anymore. I don\u2019t really know who I am, who You are, or what faith looks like. But if You want to talk, I\u2019m here now.\u201d\nBy the end of the evening, Don realizes something profound:\nChapter 10 | Belief: The Birth of Cool\n\u201cMy most recent faith struggle,\u201d writes Don at the beginning of his chapter, basically making the main point of the book, \u201cis \n one of intellect.\u201d\nIn other words, he doesn\u2019t think that there\u2019s any point in discussing whether God exists or not. \n who believe that he doesn\u2019t and, moreover, believe that they can prove that he doesn\u2019t; there are also other guys who believe the opposite. \nAs far as Don is concerned, it really doesn\u2019t matter one bit: \u201cthe argument stopped being about God a long time ago, and now it\u2019s about who is smarter, and honestly I don\u2019t care.\u201d\nWhy?\nBecause, \n, we rarely do things for intellectual reasons; most of the time, we do them for emotional.\n\u201cIf I walk away from Him,\u201d Don writes, \u201cand please pray that I never do, I will walk away for social reasons, identity reasons, deep emotional reasons, the same reasons that any of us do anything.\u201d\nHence, you can be religious even if your outward appearance doesn\u2019t show this; the question of belief is a deeper, more emotional, and more universal question than the question of coolness.\nChapter 11 | Confession: Coming Out of the Closet\nEach year at Reed there\u2019s a festival called Ren Fayre \u2013 an excuse for getting drunk, getting high, and, we guess, getting laid.\nFor some reason, Don and other Christens at the college decided that this festival is the best place for them to come out of the closet and confess their faith to others.\nHow?\nBy confessing the sins of God, Jesus, and the Church to the non-believers around.\nGet it?\nIt\u2019s the world turned upside-down.\nAnd from the confessional, when asked by another non-religious student named Jake whether he \n believes in Jesus, Don says it out loud: \u201cYes, I think I do. I have doubts at times, but mostly I do.\u201d\n\u201cSo many years before I had made amends to God,\u201d concludes Don, \u201cI had made amends to the world. I was somebody who was willing to share my faith. It felt kind of cool, kind of different. It was very relieving.\u201d\nChapter 12 | Church: How I Go Without Getting Angry\n\u201cThe church is a hospital for sinners,\u201d wrote once Abigail Van Buren, \u201cnot a museum for saints.\u201d As a review of \nnotes, Miller, in a way doesn\u2019t believe either.\nTo him, a church should be understood the very way Jesus described it: wherever two people are talking about him.\nIn fact, he ends this chapter by offering a three-step formula on how to find a church where you can go to without getting angry about the values it fails to represent nowadays:\n\u2022 Pray that God will show you a church filled with people who share your interests and values;\n\u2022 Go to the church God shows you;\n\u2022 Don\u2019t hold grudges against any other churches. God loves\nSounds easy enough, ha?\nChapter 13 | Romance: Meeting Girls Is Easy\nThe highlight of this chapter is a few-page-long quote from \n, a play by Donald Miller himself, \u201cthe story of one man\u2019s life from birth to death, each scene delivered through a monologue with other actors silently acting out parts behind the narrator as he walks the audience through his life journey.\u201d\nIn it, the husband whispers to his sleeping wife words of love which sound romantic, but which also include just too much of God and biblical references to be poignant.\nChapter 14 | Alone: Fifty-Three Years in Space\nIn this chapter, Miller reveals both his loneliness and how he used to think that being in love with someone is the only cure for it.\nNowadays, he doesn\u2019t seem to believe that love is \n opposite of loneliness, but merely \n opposite, because he knows full well from the many moments passed in solitude that, when alone, a man craves for many things, a romantic partner being merely one of them.\n\u201cI think our society puts too much pressure on romantic love,\u201d he writes, \u201cand that is why so many romances fail. Romance can\u2019t possibly carry all that we want it to.\u201d\nWe believe Donald\u2019s right.\nThere are also a few quite interesting paragraphs in this chapter dedicated to Donald Miller\u2019s appreciation of Emily Dickinson\u2019s poetry.\nNow, that\u2019s a long-lasting crash of Don\u2019s.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care why we get crushes on Emily Dickinson,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt is a rite of passage for any thinking man. Any thinking American man.\u201d\nChapter 15 | Community: Living with Freaks\nHave you ever watched Dan Harmon\u2019s \n(which, by the way, was amazing)?\nIf so, then you can guess what this chapter is all about: Donald moves in with some other guys and realizes why his pastor, Rick, doesn\u2019t believe that faith is something you do alone.\nIn fact, Rick is the one who suggests that Don should live in a community: solitude is not something a man should experience, he thinks, you know, being a social being and all.\nOf course, there are plenty of unplanned events and mishaps when you\u2019re living in a community, but, in the end, it\u2019s worth it.\nJust like in marriage: you lose some freedom in the short term, but that\u2019s the only way to earn that coveted victory lap after all is said and done.\nChapter 16 | Money: Thoughts on Paying Rent\nYou\u2019ll understand why we have to quote the beginning of this chapter in full:\n\u201cI hate not having money,\u201d goes on Donald Miller. \u201cI hate not being able to go to a movie or out for coffee. I hate that feeling at the ATM when, after getting cash, the little receipt spits out, the one with the number on it, the telling number, the ever-low number that translates into how many days I have left to feel comfortable.\u201d\nA successful book and a movie later, we kind of guess that Donald\u2019s quite better now. For one, we don\u2019t think that the number on that receipt is low now.\nChapter 17 | Worship: The Mystical Wonder\n\u201cThere are many ideas within Christian spirituality that contradict the facts of reality as I understand them,\u201d writes Don tellingly. \nNow, he\u2019s pretty aware that \u201ca statement like this offends some Christians,\u201d but he stands by it: \u201cthere are all sorts of things our hearts believe that don\u2019t make any sense to our heads,\u201d he goes on. \u201cLove, for instance; we believe in love. Beauty. Jesus as God.\u201d\nDonald says that he doesn\u2019t believe that one can be a true Christian without being a mystic. \n), belief is something beyond our grasp of reality, something inexpressible, something downright mystical. \nAs far as Don is concerned, even if our theology is wrong (as it seems to him that it is), he firmly believes that God has everything figured out. \nAnd he respects this in wonder.\nBecause, he concludes, \u201cwonder is that feeling we get when we let go of our silly answers, our mapped out rules that we want God to follow. I don\u2019t think there is any better worship than wonder.\u201d\nChapter 18 | Love: How to Really Love Other People\nTo our eyes, this is one of the most interesting chapters in the book. In it, Don reveals how living with a bunch of hippies during one summer taught him the \ndifference between being good and bad.\nSurprise, surprise \u2013 it has nothing to do with how you proclaim your faith to others; it has everything to do with how you practice it.\nYou see, there are many people who go to church and dub themselves Christians, but who are, deep down in them, bigots, racists, sexists, and would want to build a wall to keep Mexicans far from the USA.\nWe\u2019re not putting words into Donald\u2019s mouth: he really understands why liberals don\u2019t like Republicans. \nThe real issue in the Christian community, he says, is its conditionality. \nSimply put, if you are with us, we like you. However, if you have questions \u2013 \u201cquestions about whether the Bible was true or whether America was a good country or whether last week\u2019s sermon was good\u201d \u2013 you are not so loved.\nEven worse, you are loved only in word, but not in practice.\n\u201cBy toeing the party line you earned social dollars,\u201d Donald writes, \u201cby being yourself you did not. If you wanted to be valued, you became a clone.\u201d\nNow, how is that relevant to Donald living with hippies for a summer?\nWell, he never felt more alive than that time. And he never felt more loved or loving. Because these people didn\u2019t judge anyone because of their beliefs; even though non-religious, they were far more practicing in what the Bible states than preaching Christians.\nA hippie would have no problems talking about everything with a Christian; a Christian, on the other hand, would have all sorts of problems even with a hippie living two houses from him.\nNow, who\u2019s the \nChristian there?\nChapter 19 | Love: How to Really Love Yourself\nNow that we\u2019ve learned how to \nlove other people, it\u2019s time to learn how to really love ourselves.\nAs far as Don was concerned, this was not an option: as we already explained above, the only way to accept Jesus is by being humble, and loving yourself seems to have arrogance written all over it.\nHowever, after going to a therapist on account of his romantic troubles, Don realizes that the only alternative to loving yourself is hating yourself.\nIn other words, you do not love yourself merely because of you; you love yourself because of those around you. Only the ones who truly love themselves can love others, and only the ones who love others are accepted by God.\nSo, there it is: a great apology for being a narcissist.\nChapter 20 | Jesus: The Lines on His Face\nWell, it\u2019s safe to say that in this chapter you\u2019ll encounter one of the most blasphemous sentences ever written by a preaching/acting Christian: \u201cSometimes I picture this Osama Bin Laden-looking Jesus talking with His friends around a fire\u2026\u201d\nWe may be ignorant, but we don\u2019t remember ever reading someone comparing Jesus to Osama Bin Laden.\nAnd yet \u2013 all you, offended Christian, shut your ears \u2013 this is a fairly correct \n, in the \u201cCharlie Chaplin looks like Hitler\u201d sense.\nThe problem?\nAfter reading this sentence, we can\u2019t seem to think of Osama without thinking of Jesus and vice versa. Hopefully, it will pass.\nAnyway, in this last chapter, Donald returns once again to the introductory jazz/God comparison and expands it to include Christianity.\nAnd this is a beautiful comparison to end our summary with:\nKey Lessons from \u201cBlue Like Jazz\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jesus Is Something You Should Experience, Not Something You Can Know\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Church Is a Place Where People Share Your Interests and Values\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You Love Yourself So That You Can Love Others\nJesus Is Something You Should Experience, Not Something You Can Know\nThere\u2019s no point in looking for a scientific explanation of God; even if it exists, it is, in a way, the antidote to the nature of belief.\nWe believe because of some inner radar which works the same way the inner radars of penguins do: \n, they \n exactly what they should do to save the lives of their unborn children, and yet they never communicate it.\nWell, this is how faith looks like. \nIt is about wonder, not about science.\nA Church Is a Place Where People Share Your Interests and Values\nConsequently, Donald Miller wouldn\u2019t blame you if you don\u2019t like going to church. Many of the people there are simply not good people: they act as if they are religious, but deep in their hearts, they are not.\nThe best way to really start loving going to church is to find a church filled with people who share your interests and values.\nAnd they don\u2019t even have to be Christians: Donald Miller had one such experience with liberal booze-loving drug-using hippies.\nYou Love Yourself So That You Can Love Others\nIn order to love God, and let Him in your heart, you need to be humble; and yet, in order to be humble, you need to first learn to love yourself.\nIt is a bit of a paradox, but it makes sense.\nBecause the only alternative to loving yourself is hating yourself; and people who hate themselves are bitter and can\u2019t love other people, let alone God.\nJust think of it this way: you\u2019ll help more people during a plane crash if you put your protection mask first and then start doing this for those around you.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cBlue Like Jazz Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nis a curious book: it may seem too unchristian to Christians, and too cool for a Christian to atheists.\nBut that\u2019s exactly why you should read this book, regardless of your starting position.\nEven if it does nothing else for you, it will certainly make you think.\nChristion or non-Christian."},
{"title": "The End of Jobs PDF Summary", "url": "https://blog.12min.com/the-end-of-jobs-pdf-summary/", "cover": null, "content": "6 min read \u231a\u00a0\nI\u2019ve been a little bit surprised by the title of \n\u2018s book: \n. My first\u00a0thought was \u201cwouldn\u2019t be a better title: the end of jobs as\u00a0we know them\u201d?\nAfter all, there are a lot of factors involved in this discussion and it depends a lot on the type of job that you are performing.\nWe cannot all become an entrepreneur, that\u2019s for sure. But if you are in doubt and you don\u2019t know if it is the right decision to choose that direction, you are going to love this book.\nThe basic idea of the book is that \n. In fact, the funny part is that: keeping your current job and having nothing else to rely on may be in the end the worst decision.\n tries to give us the insights on this issue.\nThese are phenomena that are not slowing down or stopping: \nMany of the jobs that our grandparents had\u00a0are now obsolete and the specialists say that by the year 2030, around 50% of the job titles that we have today, will no longer exist.\nThis is due to technology. What globalization and the internet did, was to create access for young entrepreneurs to cheap resources from all over the world.\nYou no longer need an office and a staff hired in your country. You can work from home and hire an accountant from India, a web designer from China or a content writer from Russia.\n So what if you don\u2019t make it from the start? You learn your lesson and try again. Just that now your costs are not so high and you are not completely bankrupt:\n gives us an example:\u00a0two young people with the same studies, same aptitudes, but who chose different paths. One went and got a job at a good company.\nHe got a mortgage, indulged in some extra expenses because he was sure that at some point he will be promoted.\nThe other started small as an entrepreneur, many times he hardly \n, but he worked hard and always kept his eyes on the prize: \nThe first one, was substituted with a person working from an underdeveloped country, willing to do the job for a lot less money.\nThe second guy, had a rough start, but managed to build his own company and was not making a profit. So the conclusion of the story is that:\nI think this quote pretty much sums up \nWe reached a development point where people if they really want to, are able to design and create their realities and their jobs. You are no longer trapped in a factory, you just need to focus on what you want to achieve and work for it.\nThe fact that we can find cheaper workforce overseas has its ups and downs. On one hand, \n with relatively small resources and employ or contract people at very good rates.\nBut, on the other hand, it could indicate that you are being laid off because the company you work for decided to employ other people capable to do your job, but also prepared to work for far less money:\nIt is hard even for the new generations to understand and cope with the level of intensity at which technology is developing. Let\u2019s take the sequencing of the human genome.\nIt took seven years only for a small portion (1%) to be analyzed and segmented and then in only fifteen years, the project was completed. People were not able to make these kinds of predictions.\nOnce a discovery is made, the progress coming out of it is dramatically increased and people find it hard to keep up with all the information available and the systems created.\nThe book also tries to deal a bit with \n. They think \n, they \n, and they \n.\nTaylor Pearson tells us in a reassuring tone that other people are not necessarily smarter than the rest, but they have something that is crucial in order to be successful: \nYou don\u2019t need a great idea from the beginning. Ideas will come to you for sure and the resources will come up as well. What you need are strong, reliable relationships with people that are already successful in business, or that maybe are searching for partners:\nIt was interesting to discover in the book, how the power shifted over the centuries.\nNowadays, we still have a \n, but the power is much more dispersed and available to many people. To some extent, we have more power than ever in the human history to go out and create our own future.\nis that because they were the safe thing to do for such a long time, it will be the safe thing for the future also. We are actually just accumulating silent risk.\nWe think we are doing great at our job, but since it\u2019s not our decision to make, we could get fired at any given time: \nThe book talks also about \n. More and more young people are willing to work hard and for relatively low pay, just to have access to a great mentor and the know-how of a company.\nIt\u2019s a trend that can be transformed into a win-win situation. You are aware that this person will not stick with your company for more than 2-3 years, but they could become a potential partner after they go on their own.\nThe salary is smaller than in the case of a regular employee and they are willing to work very hard.\nOn the other hand, the young person that is entering an apprenticeship has the opportunity to learn valuable stuff and gain experience without investing his own money and he will have time to create the much-needed relationships:\nThe internet is really the one to thank when it comes to the freedom of information. Think about all the resources and wisdom nuggets that we have access to.\nBefore, if you wanted to know something you had to go to a library and pray that they have the right book where you can find the answer. Now, with one click of a button, in few seconds, all you want to know becomes available.\nSo, the direction of the evolution of the world seems to be on the side of those who want to become entrepreneurs.

Moffett is your guy for questions such as this.\nThe title of his book says pretty much everything:\nWho Should Read \u201cThe Human Swarm\u201d? And Why?\nAs Michael Shermer, the author of \nand the publisher of the \nmagazine has noted, \nis yet another addition to the Canon of Big History studies, joining classics such as Jared Diamond\u2019s \n, Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s \n, and Steven Pinker\u2019s \nIf you\u2019ve read and liked any of these five books, then you\u2019re sure to like \nas well. \u201cThis fine work,\u201d says a starred review in \n, \u201cshould have broad appeal to anyone curious about human societies, which is basically everyone.\u201d \nAnd really, there aren\u2019t many books better\u2014or more wide-ranging\u2014than Mark W. Moffett\u2019s \n if you want to find out more about how human societies work and what makes them work.\nAbout Mark W. Moffett\n is an American tropical biologist, specialized in the ecology of tropical forest canopies and the social behavior of ants.\nCalled \u201cdaring eco-adventurer\u201d by none other than Margaret Atwood, Moffett is a research associate at the Smithsonian and a visiting scholar in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. \nHe has received many awards for his work, including the Lowell Thomas Medal for exploration.\nIn addition to \n, Moffett has also written three more books:\n, \n, and \n.\n\u201cThe Human Swarm PDF Summary\u201d\nA 500-pages-long journey, meandering \u201cthrough multiple and varied disembarkation points,\u201d \nis divided into nine sections, each of which is in turn divided into several chapters.\nWe tried replicating the structure in our summary, which, unfortunately, does little justice to the magisterial effort that is Mark Moffett\u2019s exceptional book.\nHopefully, however, our summary will inspire you to buy \nand read it yourself. \nSection I: Affiliation and Recognition\nIn the first section, \n, Mark W. Moffett talks about \u201cthe wide range of vertebrate societies.\u201d\nWhether by biologists or anthropologists, societies are often defined either in terms of identity or in terms of cooperation. \nAs far as humans are concerned, the latter definition seems better: after all, we humans have evolved such that cooperation is central to our survival. \nHowever, following Benedict Anderson\u2019s idea of the \u201cimagined community,\u201d Mark W. Moffett uses the introductory chapter to reconsider the role of cooperation in societies, and show that it is \u201cless essential than the matter of identity.\u201d\nIn other words, not just in humans, \u201csocieties consist of a distinct set of members in a rich tapestry of relationships, not all of which are harmonious. \u201c\nIf you remember the ideas of any of the Enlightenment philosophers\u2014say, \n or \n\u2014you already know that the basic idea behind the creation of society means giving away some of your own freedoms so that you get safety in return.\nIn this chapter, Moffett shows that the same mechanism works in vertebrates\u2014and especially in the world of mammals.\nNamely, despite the imperfections in the system of partnership, animal societies exist because they provide their members with better protection from outsiders and, thus, are a guarantee for the satisfaction of their basic needs.\nYou\u2019ve probably heard the words \u201cfission\u201d and \u201cfusion\u201d before, right? However, we doubt that you\u2019ve heard them in the context of animal and human societies.\nWell, Moffett borrows them from the world of nuclear physics and reuses them here to describe a special type of animal societies: fission-fusion types.\n\u201cFission-fusion sounds esoteric,\u201d writes Moffett, \u201cbut there\u2019s an abundance of reasons to look at this lifestyle. The fission-fusion species include virtually all the brainy mammals that anthropologists studying the social brain hypothesis salivate over\u2014most significantly, us, \n\u201d\nWhat does a fission-fusion society entail?\nPrecisely what the two words imply: constant dispersion and recreation of the society.\nIn other words, in fission-fusion societies, \u201csociety members temporarily cluster here and there in social groups that form, dissolve, and reform elsewhere.\u201d\nAs we\u2019ve already uncovered above, we\u2019re not talking merely about spotted hyenas, lions, bottlenose dolphins, bonobos, and chimpanzees; we\u2019re talking about hunter-gatherers as well.\nBut we\u2019ll get there.\nNow, the most fascinating aspect of human societies\u2014and the one Benedict Anderson was especially interested in\u2014is that humans do not need to know each other for their societies to stay together.\nHence, \u201cimagined communities.\u201d\nPut simply, in most animals, all members of a society are obliged to know each other as \n, whether they like it or not.\n, you already know that there\u2019s a limit to the number of people you can actually know, i.e., the number of people you can call friends.\nBritish anthropologist Robin Dunbar gave us an actual number (now, of course, called Dunbar\u2019s number): humans can maintain about 150 stable relationships.\nHowever, most human societies number far, far more than 150 members. For example, there are 300 million people living in the United States!\nApparently, you don\u2019t need to know them all\u2014or even a significant number of them\u2014to consider that they belong in the same society as you!\nSo, how did humans break free from the constraint of being obliged to know each member of a society and, thus, create the most powerful societies in history?\nRead ahead to find out!\nSection II: Anonymous Societies\nWe said above that there\u2019s a population limit \u201cin most animals;\u201d the second section of \nis about the animals where such a limit doesn\u2019t seem to exist: social insects.\nNo matter how strange it may seem to you, when it comes to building a society, we are more akin to ants than we are to bonobos. \nAnd Mark W. Moffett uses the fifth chapter to show why.\nAlmost expectedly, the size of a society increases its complexity\u2014with almost no exception\u2014which results in some ant societies being more similar to human societies than ape societies.\nAfter all, unlike bonobos, ants are capable of doing all kinds of \u201chuman\u201d things like building roads, creating traffic rules, having public hygiene workers, and even working on assembly lines!\nHow do ants know that they belong in the same community as other ants?\nWell, because of chemistry, i.e., a scent; for comparison, another mighty society\u2014that of the sperm whales\u2014is founded upon another sense, i.e., shared sounds.\nNeither scent nor sounds are memory-dependent; nor are they (with a few exceptions, but let\u2019s not go into them) hackable.\nIn other words, the societies of ants and sperm whales can reach immense size because they can be sure in the allegiance of their members.\nAnd they don\u2019t allow in anyone who doesn\u2019t have the same scent or can produce the same sound.\nThat\u2019s why they are the ultimate nationalists.\nAnalogously, humans have broken the membership glass ceiling through comparable markers.\nYou know that you are an American\u2014or whatever else\u2014even though you haven\u2019t met even \n part of the members of your society, because of several markers you share with your fellow beings: language, religion, history, philosophy of life, etc.\nAnd it goes even further and deeper than that, including behaviors so subtle they may only be noticed subliminally.\nFor example, in Iran and Bulgaria they nod for \u201cno;\u201d if you nod for \u201cyes,\u201d then you are an outsider.\nSection III: Hunter-Gatherers Until Recent Times\nThe three chapters included in Section III ask what the societies of our species were like before the advent of agriculture. \nMoffett refers to as \u201cband societies\u201d the people who lived nomadically in small, spread-out groups called bands. \nThis is the fusion-fission life we talked about before: \n\u201cPeople mostly clumped here and there in bands,\u201d writes Moffett. \u201cEach band consisted of on average 25 to 35 individuals comprising several, usually unrelated, nuclear families, often spanning three generations.\u201d\nNormally, a person could visit other bands, yet tended to keep a long-term connection with one. \n\u201cShifts between bands usually came about with little effort but not often,\u201d concludes Moffett, \u201ca far cry from the eternally fluid movements of chimpanzees and other fission-fusion species characterized by ever-changing parties.\u201d\n\u201cTo get some idea of how a band society functioned in the day-to-day,\u201d Moffett goes on in the next chapter, \u201cthink of each band, with its two- or three-dozen residents, not merely as a neighborhood in the social sense\u2026 [but also as] a local manufacturing center.\u201d\nMore precisely:\nBut you already know this for two reasons: first and foremost, because the nomadic hunter-gatherer societies are treated as \u201cthe gold standard for our ancestral condition,\u201d and secondly, because we\u2019ve already introduced you to them via James Suzman\u2019s exceptional \n.\nHowever, the band societies weren\u2019t the only type of hunter-gatherer societies that existed: there were also the settled hunter-gatherers as well.\nAnd there\u2019s a big difference between how a nomadic hunter-gatherer society functions, and what it turns into after settling.\nIf you remember from our summary of James Suzman\u2019s book, nomadic hunter-gatherers are \u201cequality-minded jacks-of-all-trades, who solved issues by discussion,\u201d but the societies of settled hunter-gatherers have leaders, divide labor, and result in immense disparities in wealth.\nNowadays, most of us behave like settled hunter-gatherers. However, the very existence of nomadic hunter-gatherer societies is evidence in favor of \u201ca psychological versatility we still possess.\u201d\nIn other words, there\u2019s another\u2014arguably better\u2014way for organization. Why did the other one win? That\u2019s covered in Section IV. \nSection IV: The Deep History of Human Anonymous Societies\nSection IV consists of only one chapter: \u201cPant-Hoots and Passwords;\u201d it tries to explain \n how nomadic life evolved into settled, but why settled hunter-gatherer societies were the only ones capable of becoming anonymous, which, as we explained above is the hallmark of a developed society.\nIn other words, at some point in the distant past, \u201cour ancestors must have taken the crucial but heretofore overlooked evolutionary step of making use of badges of membership that would, in time, permit our societies to grow large.\u201d\nTo understand how this happened, Moffett scrutinizes the behavior of our nearest relatives: the chimpanzees and the bonobos. \nAnd he puts forward a striking hypothesis.\nNamely, that \u201ca simple shift in how the apes use one of their vocalizations, the pant-hoot, could make that sound essential for identifying each other as society members.\u201d\n\u201cSuch a transformation,\u201d Moffett explains, \u201ccould have easily occurred in our distant ancestors. Ever more markers would have been added to this initial \u2018password,\u2019 many of them connected to our bodies, transforming them into flesh-and-blood bulletin boards for displaying human identity.\u201d\nIn other words, if your parents don\u2019t approve of you getting a tattoo, tell them that tattoos are the reason why modern societies exist.\nSection V: Functioning (or Not) in Societies\nSection V moves on to exploring the psychology underlying these markers and society membership. It consists of five chapters.\nIn the first chapter of the fifth section of \n, Mark Moffett analyzes how these initial markers evolved to function the same way smells and sounds function in social ants and sperm whales.\nIn other words, in time, these artificial markers started possessing some underlying essence which made the members of one society (and ethnicity and race) feel so \nand \n that, in comparison to other groups, they see themselves as nothing short of separate biological species.\nOf course, \n, these markers are most powerful when they are (essentially fake) narratives which are passed over from generation to generation.\nIn order for this to happen, these fake narratives are also sacred and unquestionable: members who question them are questioned themselves, i.e. if you doubt the validity of a story shared by your community, people would start wondering if you are a member of that community or an outsider.\nYup, we\u2019re talking about stereotypes.\nIn time, because of mechanisms such as the one described above, stereotypes get attached to prejudices, and prejudices are, \n, expressed automatically.\nBecause of this, members of a society often perceive an outsider not as a unique individual\u2014which he/she, by definition, is\u2014but as a member of another society.\nThis, in turn, deepens the differences between societies and results in using the outsider societies as a cohesive element for any given society.\nIt seems that we have an innate \u201cpenchant for ranking outsiders as \u2018below\u2019 our own people or in some cases as subhuman altogether.\u201d\nIn other words, because of the deepened differences between societies, a person can believe that, even though \n \na unique individual functioning within a society relatively freely, a member of another society acts solely as a clog in a larger machine which has goals and objectives of its own.\n\u201cWe are disposed to discount the differences between individuals,\u201d writes Moffett, \u201cand to perceive the members of other societies\u2014and to a lesser extent those of our own\u2014as both similar and forming a unified whole.\u201d\nThe final chapter of the fifth sections considers \u201cthe ways in which the psychology of families relates to perceptions of our society, granting the influence of both in human affairs.\u201d\nIn other words, are societies something like extended families?\nThe interesting conclusion is that, even though, by definition, they are not\u2014families share genes, and communities nothing but imagined stories\u2014they are still as foundational and as important about the healthy development of the human psyche as families.\nSection VI: Peace and Conflict\nTitled \u201cPeace and Conflict,\u201d Section VI takes on \u201cthe issue of the relationships among societies.\u201d\nThe good news: the answer to the question above is \u201cno.\u201d\nThe bad news: \u201cwhile animal societies need not be in conflict, peace between them is relatively rare, present in just a few species and supported by situations of minimal competition.\u201d\nAs you know full well, in addition to your highly developed neocortex, your brain also includes the amygdala, still wired the way it is in all animals, i.e., firing its \u201cage-old cautionary reflexes of fight or flight\u201d around the clock!\nThat is why \u201ceven for groups on excellent terms, sublimated biases ensure the playing field is never perfectly level, as each side jockeys for a better deal.\u201d\nAfter all, even hunter-gatherer societies\u2014relatively peaceful between each other when there were enough resources\u2014didn\u2019t act peacefully when resources and opportunities would dry up.\nSo, how do we keep the peace when competition is raging?\nWell, \n, there\u2019s some good news:\nSection VII: The Life and Death of Societies\nSection VII, \u201cThe Life and Death of Societies,\u201d examines \u201chow societies come together and fall apart.\u201d \nEven though \u201cthe dynamics of society genesis and transformation play out in a manner unique to each species,\u201d depending on \u201cthe rules by which the members of the species interact and identify each other, and the resources available at a certain time,\u201d a theme emerges:\nAnd this theme\u2014analyzes Moffett throughout this whole section\u2014is observable in both animal and human societies.\nAs an excellent example of how an animal society crumbles, Moffett uses the case of the Gombe chimpanzees documented by Jane Goodall in the early 1970s.\nWhen Goodall first came to Gombe about a decade before 1971, there was no evidence of factions. But in that year, it was clearly visible that the original group had split into factions, later named Kasakela (on the north) and Kahama (on the south).\nAt first, the two factions were somewhat amicable between each other, but after some time the Kasakela apes obliterated the Kahama community and took back much of its territory in the following few years.\n\u201cThe two-step process at Gombe\u2014the emergence of internal factions followed by division\u2014seems to be omnipresent among primates that live in societies, having now been documented for the troops of at least a couple dozen monkey species,\u201d writes Moffett?\nIs the same true about human societies as well?\nUnfortunately\u2014yes.\nAnd the reason is simple: as Charles Darwin wrote in the final sentence of \n: \u201cEndless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\u201d\nAnd this evolution occurs at different rates, and over time, creates insurmountable obstacles.\nTo understand this better, think of languages splitting over time: it is difficult to note a point in time when this happens, but it is evident that it happens.\nWell, the same occurs with human societies as well.\nSimply put, the markers which keep a society together can\u2019t be shared for all times. \nAnd when they are no longer recognized by all members of a single community, that community breaks into factions, the members of which no longer see each other as being similar.\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d writes Moffett, \u201cthe metamorphosis of societies as they splinter off from each other has been labeled \u2018pseudo-speciation,\u2019 in effect turning what had been one species of human into two.\u201d\nHunter-gatherer societies fell apart because of poor communication across hunter-gatherer bands; modern human societies fall apart because the original uniting markers keeping a society together are no longer shared. \nIt is not only that imagined things unite us\u2014it is also that imagined things (or even stranger: their reinterpretations) separate us as well.\nSection VIII: Tribes to Nations\nThe penultimate section of \n, titled \u201cTribes to Nations,\u201d explores the social changes which made the expansion of societies into states (nations) possible.\nSo, how did settled hunter-gatherer societies evolve to become something bigger, and, eventually, nations?\nPrecisely as you would expect them to: by conquering other societies.\nMark Moffett says that across the animal kingdom there\u2019s little to no evidence of societies freely merging. \nSo, it\u2019s only natural to suppose that early human tribes didn\u2019t merge either.\nAfter some time, due to growth or need for it (roadways, ships, etc.), leaders of certain villages decided to expand their dominion over the territories of their neighbors.\nThis resulted in something exceptional: the original fold started including outsiders.\nMost animal societies don\u2019t want that: when the society of the Gombe chimpanzees split, one faction wanted to destroy the other.\nHowever, humans\u2014like some social ants\u2014developed something far better than this: believe it or not, slavery!\nDue to slavery and the subjugation of entire groups of people, the exchange of membership between tribes was taken to a whole new level.\nOutsiders were now members of the original fold, but they didn\u2019t share the same status. Even though unwillingly, however, they worked for the benefit of this new tribe.\nPrecisely because of the fact that these new and larger tribes didn\u2019t consider the outsiders as equals, they were built to be destroyed from the start.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s typical of societies put together by conquest,\u201d writes Moffett, \u201cisn\u2019t division between factions\u2026 nor utter collapse, though it can happen, but rather a fracturing that almost always occurs roughly along the ancient territorial lines of the peoples that have come to make up the society.\u201d\nBecause of this, \u201clarge societies may be no more durable than small ones, fragmenting on average once every few centuries,\u201d as archeologist Joyce Marcus has demonstrated.\nSection IX: From Captive to Neighbor\u2026 To Global Citizen?\nThe final section explores the \u201ccircuitous route that led to the rise of ethnicities and races and the, at times, muddy waters of current national identities.\u201d\n\u201cTo become an interlocking whole,\u201d writes Moffett, \u201ca conquering society had to make the shift from controlling what had been independent groups to accepting them as members.\u201d\nThis, of course, \u201crequires an adjustment in people\u2019s identities, in which ethnic minority groups adjust to the majority people\u2014the dominant group that most often founded the society and controls not only its identity but also most of the resources and power.\u201d\nHowever, as we implied above, this assimilation can only be accomplished to a degree.\nYou don\u2019t need to look further back than the 20\n century to understand what we mean: both Yugoslavia and the USSR broke apart because \u201cno society can persist unless being a part of it is important to its people.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why, in the 1970s, no Yugoslav or Soviet would have believed that their countries would eventually balkanize into smaller states. But only twenty years later\u2014this seemed all but inevitable.\nSuddenly, Yugoslavia and USSR meant less to people than, say, Serbia and Croatia, or Georgia and Armenia\u2014as it had been before their creation.\nNow, there\u2019s another way to incorporate other humans within a society: immigration.\nAs you know full well, it is almost always the case that immigrants are assigned lower power and status when compared to the natives. \nIn addition, \u201cthe identity immigrants had once treasured in their ethnic homeland is often recast into broader racial groups. The shift in perception may initially be pushed on the newcomers, but they can accept the changes because of the advantages of having a more extensive base of social support in the adopted society.\u201d\nOf course, the more immigrants come, the fiercer the opposition against them is because, as is often the case, they want to save their identity by ghettoizing. And that\u2019s how and why nationalism and patriotism develop.\nAnd the circle won\u2019t be broken.\nIn an address to the United Nations, Ronald Reagan once made the following observation: \u201cI occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world.\u201d\nIf you\u2019ve read/seen \n, you know what Reagan was thinking: when the definition of an outsider changes, the definition of the member of a society changes as well.\nAn outsider can be a person who speaks another language\u2014but only until someone who, say, walks on four feet and doesn\u2019t understand the difference between languages attack us. Then, the outsider from yesterday becomes your ally; and, thus, you learn to see the similarities between you and start ignoring the differences.\nSo, will a global human society form if humankind is forced to face a common enemy?\nMark Moffett doesn\u2019t believe that\u2014even though no single society is essential, societies (as a phenomenon) are more than necessary for growth and interhuman understanding, and our \n will survive even the threat of Martians.\n\u201cSpace aliens wouldn\u2019t make nations irrelevant any more than Europeans arriving in Australia caused Aborigines to dispense with their tribes,\u201d writes Moffett. \u201cThat would be so regardless of how much the aliens shattered the beliefs people held about their own societies, whose beloved differences would now look trivial by comparison.\u201d\n\u201cMoreover,\u201d he goes on, \u201cwhen societies of our species turn to one another, whether for commercial advantage or to defend against aliens, that reliance doesn\u2019t diminish the weight they place on their differences. The notion of cosmopolitanism, the idea that the people of the world will come to feel a primary connection to the human race, is a pipe dream.\u201d\n\u201cDivided we will be,\u201d Moffett concludes somewhat bittersweetly, \u201cand divided we must stand.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Human Swarm\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anonymous Societies Are Complex Societies\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stereotypes Are Built into the Very Fabric of Human Societies\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Societies Have Always Been and Always Will Be Inevitable\nAnonymous Societies Are Complex Societies\nThe questions \u201cwhy haven\u2019t chimpanzees formed more complex societies?\u201d and \u201cwhy did the equality-minded nomads who solved issues by discussion lose the organizational war to the settled agricultural communities?\u201d have pretty much the same answer: because only anonymous societies are complex and prosper.\nAnts have anonymous societies, and so do sperm whales; chimpanzees, unlike developed humans, don\u2019t.\nIn an anonymous society, it isn\u2019t necessary that you know all members of your community because there are ways you can differentiate them from the rest.\nAnts, for example, use unchangeable scents, and sperm whales\u2014sounds. \nHumans use very complex networks of symbols\u2014called markers\u2014which can include everything from language and religion to clothing and subliminal gestures.\nStereotypes Are Built into the Very Fabric of Human Societies\nWe think of stereotypes as something one can be done with.\nUnfortunately, stereotypes are built into the fabric of human societies: it is impossible for a society to exist in the first place if it doesn\u2019t devise stories in which it is both different and superior to outsiders.\nThe very idea of an outsider stems from the existence of a stereotype, a story which defines a society. \nAnd thousands of years ago, it made absolute sense for a member of any society to trust his inner stereotypes. \nFor comparison, if a chimpanzee ventures into the territory of a different group, it will almost certainly be killed.\nSocieties Have Always Been and Always Will Be Inevitable\nEven though it may seem like a nice thought experiment a war-of-the-worlds or Armageddon-scenario in which all humans unite in one super-society because of an external threat once and for all\u2014this, says Mark Moffett, is very unlikely.\nSimply put, even before they are created, all societies have an inherent expiration date, for the simple reason that both their members and their unifying markers evolve unpredictably.\nIn time, some of these markers\u2014say, language or religion\u2014start meaning/looking differently for different people, and that\u2019s how factions are formed. \nSo, even if we manage to create one \n human society in some very distant future, it is inevitable that this society too should fall apart in no more than five hundred years.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Human Swarm Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nDescribed as \u201ca tour-de-force\u201d by Donald Johanson (the discoverer of the famous missing-link fossil \u201cLucy\u201d and founder of the Institute of Human Origins), \nbrings so much food for thought on the table that sometimes it feels as if it is several books packed into one.\n\u201cThis highly readable book,\u201d \n, \u201cis ambitious in its interdisciplinary breadth, rigorous in its science, and deeply thought-provoking in its implications.\u201d\n\u201cRead this manifesto if you like to have your mind changed,\u201d adds Kevin Kelly, author of \nand founder of \n.\nAnd we can\u2019t think of a better recommendation than Kelly\u2019s!"},

It was customary to stay on to get a master\u2019s degree in India before going abroad for a Ph.D., but I was eager to go to America as soon as I could.\u201d\nWhy, you ask?\nWell, for three reasons.\nThe first one \u2013 and the most obvious one \u2013 \n, the United States \n a land of opportunities for young people. \nThe second one \u2013 and the most compelling one \u2013 Venki\u2019s parents had already gone to the US because his father was taking a short sabbatical at the University of Illinois in Urbana.\nThe third one \u2013 and the one you\u2019ll remember best \u2013 because the USA was the home of \n and a hero for Venki and about a million other science-loving people out there. \nThree things happened afterward.\nFirst, in 1975, Ramakrishnan married Vera Rosenberry, a recently divorced woman with a daughter; \u201cat the age of twenty-three,\u201d he writes, \u201cI found myself married and the stepfather of a five-year-old girl.\u201d\nThen, a year later, he obtained a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Physics from Ohio University.\nAnd then, as soon as the latter happened, Venki realized that he doesn\u2019t want to do \u201cboring and incremental calculations that wouldn\u2019t result in any real advance in understanding.\u201d\nSo, he abruptly changed his career focus and enrolled as a graduate student in biology at the University of California, San Diego.\nThe reason?\nWell, why don\u2019t we say a couple of words about it in the next section.\nThe Ribosome, the Ultimate Code-Cracker\n\u201cMention DNA and almost everyone nods in understanding,\u201d writes somewhat despondently Ramakrishnan. \n\u201cWe all know \u2013 or think we know \u2013 what DNA means. It determines the essence of who we are and what we pass on to our children. DNA has become a metaphor for the fundamental qualities of almost anything. \u2018It is not in their DNA,\u2019 we say, even when referring to a corporation.\u201d\n\u201cBut mention the word ribosome,\u201d Venki goes on, \u201cand you will usually be met with a blank stare, even by most scientists.\u201d\nThis is both pointless and scandalous, because to DNA, the ribosome is what your video codec is to the 1s and 0s which are packed in the mkv or avi file: the thing which makes sense of it all.\nOr, in other words, the ribosome is the DNA interpreter, decoder, the molecular machine.\nThe Gene Machine.\nDefined in strictly biological terms, the ribosome is an organelle which can be found in absolutely every living cell, from bacteria to humans. It is essential for all life on Earth, and it is, consequently, as old; the information stored in the DNA molecules would be irrelevant in the absence of a ribosome to decode it.\nWriting of its importance, Ramakrishnan shares an interesting anecdote:\n\u201cThe discovery of the ribosome and its role in making proteins,\u201d concludes Ramakrishnan, \u201cis the culmination of one of the great triumphs of modern biology.\u201d\nNow, by the late 1970s (when Venki Ramakrishnan decided to change his career focus), the structure of the DNA had already been determined and solved; but how the body decodes and uses this information to pass on traits from generation to generation was barely understood.\nIn fact, just about then \u2013 in 1974 more specifically \u2013 George Emil Palade, Albert Claude, and Christian de Duve were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of the ribosome (something Palade first did about two decades before).\nRamakrishnan started working on something else though: in the laboratory of Mauricio Montal, Venki studied \u201cproteins that let ions pass through the thin membranes of lipids that envelop all cells.\u201d\nHowever, one day, in the October 1976 issue of the \n, he came across an article that would change his life.\nThe article \u2013 \u2018Neutron-scattering Studies of the Ribosome,\u2019 signed by Donald M. Engelman and Peter B. Moore, \u2013 \u201cdescribed how to locate the many different proteins on the ribosome using neutron scattering \u2013 a technique known to physicists but hardly used in biology.\u201d\nRamakrishnan immediately wrote Don, but unfortunately, he had no vacancies left at the time of his inquiry. Fortunately, the neighboring laboratory of Peter Moore had one \u2013 and the rest, as they say, is history.\nEspecially since \u2013 and interestingly enough \u2013 Moore\u2019s close collaborator was Thomas Steitz, Ramakrishnan\u2019s fiercest competitor in the race for the discovery of the structure of the ribosome.\nFour decades later, and the guys would end up sharing the Nobel Prize.\nThe Race and the Competitors\nBut first, let us introduce you to the nature of this race and the competitors at the beginning of Ramakrishnan\u2019s biology career.\nThe objective: to obtain three-dimensional crystals or images of ribosomal particles; the prospect: somewhat bleak; the existing methods: producing splotches rather than images (in fact, Venki and his colleagues explicitly and scathingly referred to crystallography as \u201cblobology.\u201d)\nAnd then a pediatrician named Hasko Paradies appeared out of nowhere, publishing an article in which he claimed to have crystallized tRNA before anyone else. \nIt turned out that he was lying, but, as Ramakrishnan writes, \u201coften, just being told something is possible breaks down a huge psychological barrier and spurs people to try things.\u201d\nAnd the people who started trying things? \nWell, dozens mentioned and hundreds of unmentioned and unsung heroes.\nHere are the main guys:\n\u2022 \n, \u201ca tall, courteous, and somewhat reserved person with a deep love of art and literature\u2026 working away in relative isolation at the Wadsworth Center in Albany for years;\u201d Frank won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2017;\n\u2022 \n, \u201cthe Sage of Santa Cruz,\u201d a bearded, long-haired jeans-wearing guy with a fondness for motorcycles and Ferraris and the \u201cdemeanor of a mellow, pot-smoking California hippie;\u201d\n\u2022 \n, \u201cthe Ferrari Boy,\u201d called that way because he rejoiced at the early maps of the ribosome just like a teenager would at the keys of a Ferrari;\n\u2022 \n; the guy already mentioned, \u201ca burly, imposing figure\u201d with Amish-like chin-strap beard and immense knowledge; direct in his approach and married to Joan A. Steitz, \u201ca top molecular biologist;\u201d\n\u2022 \n, an Israeli crystallographer with \u201cexactly the right combination of ambition and tenacity\u201d needed for the project; and\n\u2022 \n, the \u201cdark horse\u201d of the race.\nThe Politics of Recognition and the Collaborative Nature of Science\nIn 2009, the last three \u2013 sometime rivals, most of the time friends \u2013 would end up sharing the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. \n\u201cI thought you had to be really smart to win one of those,\u201d said Vera Ramakrishnan to the author upon finding out the news.\nBut there may be a deeper point behind this joke.\nRamakrishnan constantly insists on the fact that it\u2019s merely a coincidence that these three \u2013 and not some other three guys \u2013 won the Nobel Prize.\nWhy?\nBecause science is a constant pursuit by the multitude and not something that an individual does. \nTrue, Ramakrishnan worked tirelessly, but so did thousands and thousands of other people, whose studies opened his \u2013 or his colleagues\u2019 \u2013 eyes to some new discovery.\n:\nKey Lessons from \u201cGene Machine\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ribosome Is a DNA Decoder\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Venki Ramakrishnan is a Physicist \u2013 and He Won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Science Is a Collaborative Field\nThe Ribosome Is a DNA Decoder\nThe DNA is a blueprint for all life: it\u2019s where the important all the genetic instructions are written.\nHowever, without the ribosome, that information would be unusable: the ribosome is a molecular machine which reads the info from the DNA and turns the code into proteins and, therefore, us.\nIn other words, a DNA without a ribosome is pretty much a BD without a Blu-ray Disc player: neither is enough in itself, but, in combination, they work wonders!\nVenki Ramakrishnan is a Physicist \u2013 and He Won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry\nIn 1976, Venki Ramakrishnan obtained a Ph.D. in physics from Ohio University. \nMost people would consider that the summit of their scientific pursuit, but for Venki it was merely the beginning of something \n: he enrolled as a grad student in biology at the UCSD, in an attempt to find a practical use for his physics-related knowledge.\nIn 2009, Ramakrishnan won a Nobel Prize \u2013 in Chemistry!\nScience Is a Collaborative Field\nVenkatraman Ramakrishnan shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with two other people \u2013 Ada Yonath and Thomas A. Steitz.\nNothing surprising: not merely because, since about two decades ago, it\u2019s only normal for these scientific Nobel Prizes to be awarded to three people, but also because that makes much sense.\n\u201cIf I have seen further,\u201d wrote Newton in 1675, \u201cit is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.\u201d\nRamakrishnan admits that he was in that position exactly; and that even if he hadn\u2019t existed, someone else would have discovered what he did.\nAnd that\u2019s the collaborative nature of science for you.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cGene Machine Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nPart-memoir, part-detective story, \nis an engaging, wittily written, immensely important and \u2013 to quote our beloved \n \u2013 \u201cbeyond superb\u201d gem of a book.\n compares its \u201cdisarming frankness\u201d (justly) to \n, noting that \u201c\nwill be read and re-read as an important document in the history of science.\u201d\nIt is also unputdownable \u2013 so, just pick it up as soon as you find the time!"},

and\n\u2022 Part V: Speaking in the First Person (chapter 18).\nAll in all, \nencompasses 92 columns by Charles Krauthammer, framed between a fitting \u201cIntroduction\u201d and a heartbreaking \u201cEulogy\u201d by his son, Daniel.\nSince it would be impossible to summarize all of them in a couple of thousand words, we\u2019ve opted to summarize a few \u2013 of course, the ones which piqued our fancy the most.\nPraise for the Conservatives\nAs we implied above, Charles Krauthammer began his writing career as a liberal, writing speeches for Democrat Vice President Walter Mondale. \nTrue, he was a staunch anti-communist and (after all, he was Jewish) a somewhat radical pro-Israeli advocate, but, nevertheless, he was far from being a neoconservative; a \n compares Krauthammer\u2019s early political positions to those of Democrat Washington Senator, Henry M. \u201cScoop\u201d Jackson.\nIn time, however, Krauthammer\u2019s beliefs moved to the right and, just like a hero of his (Irving Kristol) and quite a few other journalists (David Horowitz, James Burnham, Whittaker Chambers), he became a leading public intellectual of American conservationism. \nNaturally, in \n,\nyou\u2019ll find quite a few columns on important figures of the conservative movement; even more naturally, we chose to make these columns the focus of our summary. \nAs you\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll expect some of Krauthammer\u2019s assessments, but you\u2019ll inevitably be surprised by others.\nKrauthammer begins his June 14, 2004, \ncolumn titled as above with a rhetorical question: \u201cWhat made Ronald Reagan the greatest president of the second half of the 20th century?\u201d\nThe implication: Ronald Reagan, the icon of the conservative movement, \nunquestionably the greatest president of the second half of the 20\n century, regardless of your opinion.\nAnd \u2013 to go back to the introductory question \u2013 there are reasons why he deserves this title.\nThe main one?\nLuck.\n\u201cLuck in his looks, luck in his voice, luck in his smile, luck in his choice of mate;\u201d also, luck in the fact that he was a President in a time of trouble and boasted with both \u201ccourage and conviction\u201d to get the USA back on track.\n\u201cThe ungenerous would say he had a great presidency but was not a great man,\u201d writes Krauthammer. \u201cThat follows the tradition of his opponents who throughout his career consistently underestimated him, disdaining him as a good actor, a \n simpleton who could read scripts written for him by others.\u201d\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d he concludes, \u201cReagan frustrated his biographers because he was so complex \u2013 a free-market egalitarian, an intellectually serious nonintellectual, an ideologue with great tactical flexibility.\u201d\nAnd above all, a man of integrity who stood firmly for \u201ca set of ideas.\u201d And, in Krauthammer\u2019s belief, there is no better definition of presidential greatness.\nAccording to Krauthammer, Reagan is also \u201cone of the great liberators of the 20\n century.\u201d The others: Roosevelt, Churchill and \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 Pope John Paul II.\nIf Reagan managed to inspire a spark in Vaclav Havel and Natan Sharansky by predicting the end of communism when few could ever predict such an outcome, Pope John Paull II \u201csparked, tended, and fanned the flames of freedom in Poland and the rest of Eastern Europe\u201d until \n.\nSubtitled \u201cThe Power of Faith,\u201d Krauthammer\u2019s April 4, 2005, \nobituary for Pope John Paul II is a demonstration of how sincere faith sometimes beats sheer power:\nIf we need to describe Bush in one sentence, Krauthammer\u2019s choice is \u201cHe kept us safe.\u201d\nTrue, he says, Bush failed to bring democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq \u2013 blame some of this on Obama, though \u2013 but he did create \u201cthe entire anti-terror infrastructure that continues to keep us safe.\u201d\nAnd that will probably remain his legacy in the mind of Krauthammer, who compares Bush to Truman.\n\u201cLike Bush,\u201d he writes, \u201cHarry Truman left office widely scorned, largely because of the inconclusive war he left behind\u2026 I suspect history will similarly see Bush as the man who, by trial and error but also with prescience and principle, established the structures that will take us through another long twilight struggle and enable us to prevail.\u201d\nDonald Trump \u2013 inevitably \u2013 is mentioned in quite a few of Charles Krauthammer\u2019s columns and his views of him tend to change from one to the next.\nIn one of his last columns on Trump \u2013 published on June 9, 2017, in \n\u2013 in which he weighs in on Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, Krauthammer shows both the extent of his intellect and the depth of his integrity.\nEven though, at least suggesting by its title, the article is primarily aimed at the journalists on the left who hyperbolize each decision made by Trump to absurd heights (this is what calls the Trump Derangement Syndrome), Krauthammer isn\u2019t interested in defending Trump\u2019s decision \n(as the rightists usually do).\nIn fact, he blames the left for mixing \u201clegitimate policy differences on the one hand and signs of psychic pathology on the other\u201d and, thus, really doing nobody a favor.\n\u201cTrump was elected to do politically incorrect \u2013 and needed \u2013 things like withdrawing from Paris,\u201d he writes. \u201cHe was not elected to do crazy things, starting with his tweets. If he cannot distinguish between the two, Trump Derangement Syndrome will only become epidemic.\u201d\nBy the way, Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from Paris was a necessary one, says Krauthammer, since \u201cthe Paris agreement itself was a huge failure\u201d from the start, punishing the West for its \u201ctwo-century head start on industrialization\u201d and giving a pass to China and India.\nThough Krauthammer isn\u2019t that convinced on the climate change consensus, he is all for a climate-change pact, but one much different than the Paris Agreement.\nIn his words, one that will be \u201cstrong and enforceable, that would impose relatively uniform demands on China, India, the United States, the European Union and any others willing to join.\u201d\nThank You, Isaiah Berlin\nFirst published on November 14, 1997, in \n\u2013 so, nine days after the death of Isaiah Berlin \u2013 this article (both a personal essay and a heartfelt eulogy to one of the greatest men of the 20\n century) is one of our favorites in the book.\nIn It, Krauthammer remembers how he was \u201ccured of the stupidities of youth\u201d by Isaiah Berlin\u2019s \n, a book he describes as \u201ca great argument for pluralism.\u201d\nPublished in 1969 (the year of grand theories and grand aspirations: liberation, revolution, historical inevitability) the book got Krauthammer back on the right track by showing him that what all those great seducers (\n, Trotsky, Mao, Ho, Castro, \n) had in common was a \n idea.\nNot one \n unifying idea as the ones in the parenthesis above, but a unifying idea full stop.\nAnd the problem with unifying ideas \u2013 i.e., grand narratives \u2013 is quite simple: they are an antidote to human freedom:\n\u201c\n is available everywhere,\u201d writes Krauthammer. \u201cBuy it. Make your children read it before they go to college, the last redoubt of romantic neo-Marxism. If they think the book is obvious, you have raised them well. If they don\u2019t, Berlin will challenge their complacency.\u201d\nMisc: Chess and Madness\nUnsurprisingly, Krauthammer\u2019s book is filled with quite a few gems of columns, some of which concern his family, others miscellaneous current events, and yet a third group some trivial human pursuits such as sports (baseball, golf, sailing).\nSince he was an avid chess player, Krauthammer couldn\u2019t resist writing a few chess-related columns: \u201cGenius, Insanity, Innocence\u201d (a review of the movie \n), \u201cMan vs. Computer: Still a Match\u201d (an analysis of the Garry Kasparov \u2013 X3D Fritz 2003 chess match) and, the most interesting of them all, \u201cThe Tyranny of Chess.\u201d\nIn all of these columns, Krauthammer notes how genius and madness are connected and how it is almost unsurprising that chess players tend to go mad from time to time.\nWell, one of them, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, a former chess champion, and the president of FIDE from 1995 to 2018, became (back in 1993) the first president of Kalmykia, a Caspian Russian republic.\nAnd he remained on the position for the next two decades (you can guess how), doing what you would expect from a chess player: almost everything wrong.\nAmong other things (some of them really, really bad) he turned Kalmykia (a Godforsaken, impoverished country \u201cwhere the sheep outnumber the people two to one\u201d) into the world\u2019s first \u201cchess state:\u201d\n\u201cCompulsory chess classes in all schools. Prime-time chess on TV. And in the midst of crushing poverty, a just-erected \u201cChess City,\u201d a surreal Potemkin village topped by a five-story glass-pavilioned chess palace where Ilyumzhinov has just staged an international chess tournament.\u201d\nThe result?\nWell, now \u201cthe world knows what chess players have known all along: a passion for chess, like a drug addiction or a criminal record, should be automatic disqualification for any serious public activity.\u201d\n\u201cColumn writing excepted, of course,\u201d Krauthammer wittily quips.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Point of It All\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Monistic Ideas Negate Freedom by Definition\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don\u2019t Underestimate the Legacy of the Conservatives\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You Can\u2019t Pigeonhole a Great Mind\nMonistic Ideas Negate Freedom by Definition\nThis is not an idea by Krauthammer, but it is nevertheless an idea he stood by during his whole life; perhaps because it is one which utterly changed his worldview when he was a 19-year-old boy.\nIt comes from Isaiah Berlin\u2019s \n, in which (among other things) one of the leading intellectuals of the 20\n century argues that monistic ideas such as Marxism fail to understand that human liberty is all about having a multitude of options.\nPutting any idea \u2013 even egalitarianism \u2013 above all others would inevitably result in the enslavement \u2013 and maybe even death \u2013 of millions of people.\nDon\u2019t Underestimate the Legacy of the Conservatives\nCharles Krauthammer deems Ronald Reagan the greatest president of the second half of the 20\n century and thinks that George Bush and even Donald Trump did some things right.\nAlso, though a Jew, he believes that Pope John Paul II was one of the great liberators of the 20\n century, together with the aforementioned Reagan, Roosevelt, and Churchill.\nIf it wasn\u2019t for these guys, he says, we would be living in a dystopian communist society; so don\u2019t forget that.\nYou Can\u2019t Pigeonhole a Great Mind\nThough a leading neoconservative voice, Krauthammer is ambivalent on more than one occasion. \nFor example, he does think that Trump is a bit mad (not as far as his policy decision are concerned but in relation to his use of Twitter), and supports abortion and gay marriage.\nAlso, though not that convinced by the science behind the climate change, he advocates for a strong international agreement and urges the USA to unilaterally start burning fewer fossils.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Point of It All Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nReading Krauthammer\u2019s columns was always a joy; and it is even a greater joy to read them this way, packed in a single volume and in retrospect.\n\u201c\n is very wide-ranging, a true Krauthammer sampler,\u201d notes Jay Nordlinger correctly. \u201cThis is Krauthammer in full, or very nearly so. It is a book that says, \u2018This is what he believed. This is who he was.\u2019 As such, it is invaluable.\u201d\nIndeed, it is."},

You are freer than any of your ancestors, but are you happy?\nDavid Brooks says: most probably, you are not. And it is precisely because of that freedom.\nLet\u2019s follow him in his quest for a moral life, as he climbs:\nWho Should Read \u201cThe Second Mountain\u201d? And Why?\nWe\u2019re living in a world where everybody is free to do whatever he/she wants, and yet most of the people say they are unhappy.\nexplains why is that so, and gives more than a satisfying \u2013 even enlightening \u2013 answer to many questions which burden today\u2019s humanity (especially millennials).\nThat\u2019s why we want to recommend it to anyone who feels lack of fulfillment and lack of joy in his/her life, and especially to those who want to find them in the seemingly unfree communal life of their neighborhoods, cities, towns, or countries. \nAbout David Brooks\n is a Canadian-born American author and journalist, most renowned as an op-ed columnist for \nBefore becoming one of \n most read columnist, Brooks worked as a film critic for \n and a reporter for \n; he is also a senior editor at \n and a contributing editor at \nand \n.\nHe makes regular appearances as a commentator on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d NPR\u2019s \u201cAll Things Considered\u201d and \u201cPBS NewsHour.\u201d\nHe is the bestselling author of five \u00a0books: \n, \n, \n, \n and this one, \n.\n\u201cThe Second Mountain PDF Summary\u201d\nEven though divided into five parts, \nis actually a two-part counter-intuitive and possibly even revolutionizing examination of \u201chow we function and conduct our lives.\u201d (\n). \nIn the first part of the book \u2013 titled \u201cTwo Mountains\u201d \u2013 Brooks offers a theoretical foundation for his belief that individualism is not the path to living a happy and moral life, i.e., is not the mountain you should climb to reach the summit of your existence.\nIn the second part \u2013 which actually consists of four separate parts \u2013 he introduces us to the four commitments which, in his opinion, may give some sense and meaning to your (and everybody\u2019s) past, present, and future.\nPart I: The Two Mountains\nThe two mountains from the title of the first part are the mountain of individuality and the mountain of commitment; separated by the valley of suffering, these two represent (in David Brook\u2019s eyes) the two paths you can go by in life and, whether you want that or not, you\u2019ve already taken one of them.\nHowever, as Led Zeppelin sang, in the long run, there\u2019s still time to change the road you\u2019re on. And Brooks says you really should; because, most probably, you\u2019ve been tricked into taking the wrong one.\nThe First Mountain\nThe first mountain is the one climbed by most modern people on their journey toward a life of happiness and fulfillment.\nIt is the mountain of individualism, as championed most fervently in the land of the free and the brave, the United States.\nAfter all, we spent most of the 20\n century waging wars against the world \u2013 first the Fascist countries such as \n and \n, and then against \n \u2013 to defend this exceptional idea: as long as you don\u2019t harm anyone, you should be able to become anything you want to be.\nAs a result, nowadays, you can \u2013 not only in the United States but also in most of Europe and parts of Asia and South America. The US prides itself in this: against the collective identities of the East, we set an agenda of freedom and individuality, and the right side won.\nPossibly \u201cthe most influential public intellectual in the Western world at the moment,\u201d \n, repeatedly states this: it is, indeed, a story of good vs. evil, and fortunately, the good won.\nWhat was the final result?\nWell, let\u2019s just say it was not the one we expected.\n\u201cThe grand narrative of individual emancipation,\u201d writes David Brooks, \u201cleft us with what some have called \u2018the great disembedding.\u2019\u201d \n\u201cWhereas before people tended to be enmeshed in tight communities with prescribed social norms that sometimes seemed stifling, now they are cut loose. Whereas once they served in hierarchical institutions, now they have trouble thinking institutionally at all \u2013 how to live within an institution, steward an institution, and reform an institution \u2013 so the quality of our social organizations that make up our common life decays.\u201d\nIn other words, individualism didn\u2019t result in a world where everybody is happy; instead, it led both the individuals and our societies as a whole far from the summit of the first mountain and into the valley of suffering and defeat.\n\u201cA half century of emancipation has made individualism, which was the heaven for our grandparents, into our hell,\u201d notes Brooks. \u201cIt has produced four interrelated social crises.\u201d\nPeople may try to tell you differently, but stats don\u2019t lie.\nWe should have realized this sooner: individualism leads to loneliness, and loneliness is a debilitating feeling. \nJust check out these numbers:\n\u2022 35% of Americans over 45 are chronically lonely;\n\u2022 No more than 8% of Americans report having important conversations with their neighbors in any given year (i.e., no less than 92% probably don\u2019t!);\n\u2022 30% of households are single-person households, as compared to less than 10% in 1950;\n\u2022 Since 1999, the U.S. suicide rate has risen by 30%: roughly 45,000 Americans kill themselves each year;\n\u2022 Most stunningly, the life span of the average American has declined for the last three years \u2013 the last time this happened, we were fighting in a war; the First World War!\nIf with individualism comes loneliness, with loneliness comes distrust. As George Eliot wrote almost prophetically in her magnum opus, \n: \u201cWhat loneliness is more lonely than distrust?\u201d We rely more on ourselves because when there is no connection, we can\u2019t rely on nobody around us.\nBack in the 1950s, three-fourths of Americans trusted their government; now, less than one-fourth does. Moreover, roughly 60% of Americans said that their neighbors were trustworthy in the 1950s; now, only half of that do; most frightening: only 18% of millennials!\n\u201cEvery age group in America is less trusting than the one before,\u201d notes Brooks, \u201cand, as Robert Putnam of Harvard points out, that\u2019s for a very good reason: People are less trustworthy. It\u2019s not that perception is getting worse. It\u2019s actual behavior. The quality of our relationships is worse. Distrust breeds distrust.\u201d\nHere\u2019s another problem that comes with individualism: if you\u2019re condemned to be free, \n, you\u2019re also condemned to find your \u201cwhy\u201d in this world by yourself.\nThe problem?\n\u201cWhen you take away a common moral order and tell everybody to find their own definition of the mystery of life, most people will come up empty. They will not have a compelling story that explains the meaning of their life in those moments when life gets hard.\u201d\nThe result?\nIn 2012, less than 6% of young Americans suffered from severe depression; three years later, that number rose up to 8.2%.\nWhether it is Sartre or Peterson, intellectuals who cherish people\u2019s freedom always advise that everyone should write his/her own story; the problem, it seems, is that not everyone is capable of doing that. \nIn the meantime, the great narratives of the past have lost all meaning as well: only half of Americans today are proud to be Americans, and only 34% of millennials agree; and just 15 years ago, 70% of Americans were \u201cextremely proud\u201d to live in this country.\n\u201cMan has a horror of aloneness,\u201d Balzac wrote in \n. \u201cAnd of all kinds of aloneness, moral aloneness is the most terrible.\u201d\nThe three crises above have given rise to a fourth one, \u201cwhich is not a facet of extreme individualism itself, but our reaction to it.\u201d\n\u201cPeople who are left naked and alone by radical individualism,\u201d reminds us Brooks, \u201cdo what their genes and the ancient history of their species tell them to do: They revert to tribe. Individualism, taken too far, leads to tribalism.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s only natural that such a thing should happen: an individual without a sense of purpose suffers from a severe case of existential dread. So, he slips into crisis mode: \u201cI\u2019m in danger! I\u2019m threatened; I must strike back!\u201d\nWe are programmed to do whatever we can to protect ourselves when we are left alone; and the easiest way to do this is to disqualify everyone suspicious. \u00a0Tribalists seek out easy categories and certainty to conquer their feelings of unbearable doubt. They seek out war \u2013 political war or actual war \u2013 as a way to give life meaning. They revert to tribe:\n noted that he who has a \u201cwhy\u201d to live can endure any \u201chow.\u201d And Viktor Frankl witnessed this firsthand in Germany\u2019s concentration camps: \n.\u201d \nIn a world of radical individuality, it is more than idealistic to expect that all people will be able to find a \u201cwhy;\u201d it is, in fact, irrational and impossible: if two \u201cwhys\u201d contradict each other, either one person will end up without it, or a conflict will inevitably erupt, the very thing we tried to axiomatically stop from the beginning (\u201c\n\u201d).\nYup, David Brooks is going where you never expected he would: freedom is overrated and is the wrong foundation to build human societies on.\nIn the dizziness of freedom, he writes poetically, \u201cnobody quite knows where they stand with one another. Everybody is pretty sure that other people are doing life better. Comparison is the robber of joy.\u201d\nDon\u2019t get him wrong: Brooks is no fool to say that all freedom is wrong; but he does think that only one of them (\n) makes sense:\nThe Second Mountain\nInstead of living the committed purpose-driven life of togetherness, most of us are living the unfulfilling and detached Instagram life of loneliness.\nThis is something David Foster Wallace already warned us in \n\u201cLearning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed.\u201d\nAs we\u2019ve implied above, Wallace\u2019s remedy is unrealistic; and you don\u2019t even need to go further than yourself to realize this:\u201cwhen you are in your distraction,\u201d reminds you Brooks, \u201cuntethered to actual commitments, focusing your attention is precisely what you cannot do. Your mind is afloat and at the play of prompts.\u201d\nIn other words, most of us are neither brave enough nor capable enough to write our own stories and find some overall direction for our lives. In a world of distractions, our minds constantly \u201cwander from the meaty big questions, which are completely daunting and unanswerable, to the diverting candy right on your phone \u2013 the tiny dopamine lift.\u201d\n\u201cAll of this, points in one direction,\u201d concludes Brooks, \u201cinto the ditch. The person who graduates from school and pursues an aesthetic pattern of life often ends up in the ditch. It\u2019s only then that they realize the truth that somehow nobody told them: Freedom sucks.\u201d\nThere\u2019s an even deeper reason \u2013 yes, deeper than all those numbers and stats above \u2013 why should freedom suck.\nBecause, in a way, its very nature is \u2013 after a certain point \u2013 incompatible not only with the nature of meaning and morality (the goals of the climber of the second mountain) but also with the nature of happiness itself (the shallow objective of first mountain climbers).\nWhy is that?\nSimply put, because we can\u2019t be happy in solitude; it doesn\u2019t matter if one runs the 100 meters under 9.58 if he doesn\u2019t know how fast someone else has run the same difference. It matters even less even when he does, but nobody has heard of his own achievement.\nAnd it goes even beyond that: as many people have shown\n. When someone has too much, nobody can be happy even if he/she has a lot.\nAbundance? Affluence? Yes \u2013 but for whom? \n. If anything, we\u2019re moving in the opposite direction, making the world a better place for fewer and fewer people.\nThe trickle-down effect means nothing in view of the notion that happiness is relational; and it means even less if you realize that happiness is fleeting as well.\nShould the goal of one be something as temporary as human happiness? Will he/she ever achieve fulfillment? \nThe answer to the question above is a resounding \u201cno.\u201d \nWhich is why we need to waste no more time and start climbing the second mountain \u2013 the mountain of commitments.\n\u201cThe person beginning the second mountain climb wages a silent rebellion against the \u2018I\u2019m Free to Be Myself\u2019 culture that is still the defining feature of our age,\u201d writes Brooks. \u201cThat individualistic culture\u2026 was itself a rebellion against the stifling conformity of the 1950s. The second-mountain ethos is a rebellion against that rebellion.\u201d\nAnd what kind of an ethos is this?\nWell, instead of \u201cShoot for personal happiness and celebrate independence,\u201d the motto of the second-mountain climbers is \u201cShoot for meaning and moral joy and celebrate interdependence.\u201d The former want to be autonomous and speak with an active voice: lecturing, taking charge; the latter praise relations and seek to listen and respond:\nParts II-V: The Four Commitments\n\u201cMost of us make four big commitments over the course of our lives: to a vocation, to a spouse and family, to a philosophy or faith, and to a community,\u201d writes David Brooks. And since the second mountain is the mountain of commitment, it is through a deep understanding of these four commitments that you can reach its summit.\nPart II: Vocation\nIn 1946, George Orwell published an essay titled \u201cWhy I Write\u201d in which he laid down for reasons to explain his decision to dedicate his life to writing novels and essays:\n#1. \n: \u201cthe desire to seem clever and to get talked about;\u201d\n#2. \n: \u201cthe pleasure he gets from playing with sentences and words;\u201d\n#3. \n \n: \u201cthe desire to see things as they are and find out true facts.\n#4. \n: \u201cthe desire to push the world in a certain direction, and to alter people\u2019s ideas of what sort of society they should strive for.\u201d\nWhat happens when two of these reasons collide?\nWell, if you are Orwell, and you have committed yourself truly and fully to your vocation, the only thing that can happen: the higher ideal wins out. \nThat\u2019s why, even though he was a Democratic Socialist, Orwell was nothing if not honest \n.\nWhat gave him this integrity?\nThe commitment, the narrative he decided to write for himself.\nChoosing a vocation is much like choosing a marriage partner: there are almost always more than just a few options, but, at a certain point, you\u2019ll have to settle for one.\nBut that\u2019s not a bad thing: otherwise, you\u2019ll become what the Elizabethans referred to as \n, aka \u201cJack of all trades\u2026\u201d Well, you know the rest of that phrase.\nIndividualism gave birth to people like William Randolph Hearst, the tabloids, reality TV: in order to remain unique, everyone will do anything, even lie about himself.\nCommitting to something doesn\u2019t work that way.\nIt usually means asking yourself the question \u201chow can I be of \nto my field of choice?\u201d and not \u201chow can it be of service to me?\u201d\nPart III: Marriage\nJust like choosing a vocation, choosing a spouse asks for commitment. \nEvolutionary, you are not built to live in a monogamous relationship; and no matter what every single pop group has sung for the past century, love is not for all times and is certainly not just a feeling; it is a scope of actions and rituals, a structure of behaviors.\nIndividualism has resulted in the destruction of the nuclear family for a reason: when you put yourself first, no relationships are possible.\nConsequently, it is almost impossible to cancel the meeting with your boss and risk climbing the corporate ladder for a date with your spouse.\nBut, as team sports have taught us, sometimes taking one for the team is the only way to achieve victory.\nIn the long run, of course.\nPart IV: Philosophy and Faith\n: participating in a spiritual community \u2013 even if secular.\nWe don\u2019t know why it lengthens life, but we can guess: people who believe in something together have a more profound \u201cwhy\u201d than people who believe in something alone.\nThis should surprise nobody: after all, we are animals, and as Aristotle knew, social animals as well; just like you wouldn\u2019t expect from an ant to thrive if separated from its community, you shouldn\u2019t expect that from a human being as well.\nNot that we can\u2019t survive or even live a reasonably happy life; but we need to do it through an enormous amount of willpower and conviction \u2013 something which most of us lack.\nFaith \u2013 and religious communities \u2013 provides \u201ca structure of behaviors\u201d which deal with all of your problems in your stead. It is more difficult to do the latter to start with. Bur more importantly, even when it is very difficult to do the first (fasting, going to church/synagogue/mosque), there\u2019s a sense of reward at the end of the road.\nRituals and vivid religious imagery help people live better and more fulfilled lives \u2013 not the least because they share both of them with other people.\nPart V: Community\nBut what if you are not a religious person? Can you participate in the revival of your community?\nOf course you can!\nThe trick is quite simple: just like in the case of choosing a vocation, a partner, or a religion, you need to put the needs of your community above your needs. \nThere is something small and petty when you do the latter \u2013 even if you become Steve Jobs, in the end, numerous people would still point out the fact that you did so because you didn\u2019t care about the feelings of those around you.\nThere is something grand and beautiful in putting the needs of your community first: even if you fail, there\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019d feel fulfilled and most people will talk only kind words of you and your existence.\nThat\u2019s exactly what many people are doing at this very moment worldwide. And the unit of change isn\u2019t the world, or the country or even the town: it is your neighborhood.\nTake the matters of the other people in your hands and do something. The communities of the world \u2013 and especially the community of the United States \u2013 are falling apart.\nAnd just like Kennedy said half a century ago: they need you to do something for them.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Second Mountain\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There Are Two Mountains You Can Climb in Life\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Climbing the First Mountain Usually Ends with a Plunge into the Valley of Suffering\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Choosing a Life of Commitments Means Choosing a Better Future for Everybody\nThere Are Two Mountains You Can Climb in Life\nThe main metaphor of David Brooks\u2019 book is the metaphor of the two mountains, separated by the Valley of Suffering.\nThe first mountain is the mountain of individual freedom: it is the mountain of autonomy and action, of personal happiness and independence.\nThe second mountain, on the other hand, is the mountain of commitment: it is the mountain of moral joy and meaning, the mountain of giving and interdependence. \nClimbing the First Mountain Usually Ends with a Plunge into the Valley of Suffering\nContrary to what almost everybody in the Western Hemisphere says for the last century, David Brooks claims that climbing the first mountain is not only an individualistic but also a lonely endeavor which almost never leads to its summit.\nOn the contrary, it ends with a plunge into the valley of suffering, as a result of the \u201cneither here nor there\u201d liquidity of absolute freedom. \nPeople, namely, are unable to find meaning in their lives and, in the absence of that \u201cwhy,\u201d they choose short-term pleasures instead of long-term commitments over and over again.\nThey are leading Instagram lives, lives of real or virtual experiences, lives that are so much empty and bereaved of meaning that, in 45,000 cases a year in the USA only, they lead to suicide.\nChoosing a Life of Commitments Means Choosing a Better Future for Everybody\nThe better way is the way of the second mountain. \nBecause, Brooks says, freedom sucks, and it only makes sense if it is a river to pass through and start climbing this second mountain; when it is an ocean, it does nobody any favor.\nThe only freedom which makes sense is the one which allows you to make any choice you like at a \n point in life; the only life which is worth living is the one in which you make certain choices and then stick to them.\nWhether it is a vocation, a marriage partner, a religion, or a community \u2013 the narrative is the same: you say \u201cyes\u201d to something, and \u201cno\u201d to everything else.\nAnd you stride forward \u2013 waving the banner of the communal future above your head, carrying it to the summit of the second mountain.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Second Mountain Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nIn our view, \nmay be one of the most important books that have appeared of lately; and it is our early favorite for the best book of 2019.\nProfound and eloquent, the \u201cbook is written with moral urgency and philosophical elegance\u201d (Andrew Solomon) and is so powerful and haunting \u201cthat works its way beneath your skin.\u201d (Oliver Burkeman).\nHopefully, for a change, it will make you start thinking of the others around you and forget about yourself."},

And Why?\nWomen should read it to understand that they are all in the fight for equality together, and policy-makers to understand why this fight is just.\nRead this book even more carefully if you are a man: hopefully, it will help you see the extent of women\u2019s troubles worldwide, and\u2014who knows?\u2014maybe even turn you into a feminist.\nAbout Melinda Gates\n is a philanthropist, businesswoman, and feminist.\nAfter receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science from Duke University and an M.B.A. from Duke\u2019s Fuqua School, Melinda got a job at Microsoft, where she worked for almost a decade, before leaving the company to focus on her family and philanthropic work. \nAs the co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Melinda \u201csets the direction and priorities of the world\u2019s largest philanthropy.\u201d In addition, she has also founded Pivotal Ventures, an investment and incubation company.\nis her first book.\n \u201cThe Moment of Lift PDF Summary\u201d\nLaunched in 2000, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) is the largest private foundation of the world (and, thus, the world\u2019s largest private charitable organization as well) with primary aims to reduce extreme poverty, expand educational opportunities, and enhance healthcare all over the world.\nIn \n, Melinda Gates tells the whole story behind it: its beginnings, its objectives, its utopian dreams of contributing to a better future.\nThe main focus is girls and women\u2014because they \nbe.\nDon\u2019t agree with us?\nWell, Melinda Gates would like to change your mind!\nChapter 1 | The Lift of a Great Idea\nSoon after founding the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Melinda went to Malawi \u201cand was deeply moved to see so many mothers standing in long lines in the heat to get shots for their kids.\u201d\nWhat got her attention even more was the answer of a young mother with small kids when asked by her, \u201cAre you taking these beautiful children to get their shots?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about \n shot?\u201d she replied. \u201cWhy do I have to walk twenty kilometers in this heat to get my shot?\u201d \n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t talking about a vaccination,\u201d comments Melinda. \u201cShe was talking about Depo-Provera, a long-acting birth control injection that could keep her from getting pregnant.\u201d\nA mother named Sadi Seyni from a small village in Niger said something even more terrifying: \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be fair for me to have another child. I can\u2019t afford to feed the ones I have now!\u201d\nIn time, Melinda realized that these were not lonely voices in the wilderness\u2014this was the leitmotif. Namely, most of these poor African women wanted to protect their children, and the best idea they had in mind was \nhaving more of them.\nOnly, they couldn\u2019t afford that.\nTheir experiences comply with the available data.\nAs Melinda says, in 2012, in the world\u2019s 69 poorest countries, 260 million women were using contraceptives. \nThat\u2019s the good news.\nThe bad news?\nOver 200 million more women in these nations \n to use contraceptives\u2014but couldn\u2019t get them.\nThe problem goes even deeper than you\u2019d think.\nAs a Bangladeshi study spanning over two decades has discovered, contraceptives make the lives of both the mothers and the children better and longer.\n\u201cIt took us years to learn that contraceptives are the greatest life-saving, poverty-ending, women-empowering innovation ever created,\u201d concludes Melinda.\nFortunately, now we know.\nChapter 2 | Empowering Mothers: Maternal and Newborn Health\n\u201cSocialism never took root in America,\u201d wrote someone somewhere (probably Ronald Wright in \n),\nbecause the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.\u201d\nSocialism aside\u2014the second part of the quote sounds quite true: because of the American Dream, most Americans believe that the poor are simply \n and that not having enough money to meet your own needs speaks much more about you than the system.\nHowever, throughout her work\u2014and through an enlightening discussion with the late great \n\u2014Melinda Gates learned another, much better definition of poverty:\nWhat does this mean in practice?\n3 million newborns die \n, and most of them die because of poverty. In other words, most of these 3 million deaths happen in far-off, impoverished places where death holds dominion over areas of life from which it has been banished in the West long, long time ago.\nFortunately, since the early 1990s, the global vaccination drive cut the number of childhood deaths in half.\nYou can see where this is going already: if you want to help mothers protect their children, give them access to free vaccination.\nAlso\u2014as we read in the first chapter\u2014give them access to free contraception as well; because, instead of getting better, things are getting worse during the last few years.\nChapter 3 | Every Good Thing: Family Planning\nIn 1994, the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo drew more than 10,000 participants from around the world. \nIt is still the largest conference of its kind and, as Melinda Gates says, it marks \u201ca historic early statement on the rights of women and girls.\u201d\nWhy?\nBecause it unambiguously \u201curged the empowerment of women, set goals for women\u2019s health and education, and declared that access to reproductive health services, including family planning, is a basic human right.\u201d\nThe problem?\nFunding for family planning hasn\u2019t increased since 1994; in fact, it has dropped \n since Cairo.\nWhy?\nWell, blame it on the conservative governments who are coming to power all over the world.\nDon\u2019t believe us?\nWell, take the United States as an example.\nDuring the past few decades, the US was exceptionally successful in bringing down teen pregnancy rates. \nIn fact, the country is at a historic low for teen pregnancy, and the number of unintended pregnancies is one of the lowest in history as well.\nWhat brought about this outcome?\nTwo things.\nFirst of all, the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program, which spends $100 million a year to reach low-income teens in communities across the United States.\nAnd secondly\u2014yes!\u2014the Affordable Care Act, which allows women to get contraceptives without paying for them out of their pocket.\nYou know where this is going, don\u2019t you?\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d notes Melinda Gates, \u201cthat progress is in jeopardy\u2014both the drop in unwanted pregnancies and the policies that helped make it happen. The current administration is working to dismantle programs that provide family planning and reproductive health services.\u201d\nWhy?\nBeats us!\n.\nIt seems that the goal of his policies is to replace programs proven to work with programs proven \n to work. (Abstinence-only sex? Really?)\nChapter 4 | Lifting Their Eyes: Girls in School\nBecause of the reasons Melinda Gates uncovers above, she decided that family planning should be one of the main objectives of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\u201cBut every time I\u2019ve thought, \n,\u201d she notes, \u201cI\u2019d meet another woman or girl who would show me a \n picture. And my most important teachers were not the experts we would meet with in Seattle. They were women and girls who met us in their towns and talked about their dreams.\u201d\nWell, one of these girls was Sona, a 10-year-old from a very poor community in a village called Kanpur.\nKanpur is mainly inhabited by the lowest of Indian castes. If you\u2019ve read our summary of the incredible journalistic work that is \nyou can already guess how life looks like in Kanpur.\nFor most of the people there, the highlight of the month is finding something valuable in the trash that can be sold in return for some money.\nFamily planning is just one of the problems here.\nAnd, intuitively, the 10-year-old Sona knew that full well.\n\u201cI want a teacher,\u201d she would repeatedly say to Gary Darmstadt, a foundation colleague of Melinda, when he went to Kanpur in 2011 to talk about family planning.\nFamily planning is helpful.\nBut the truth is, unless the kids of the women taught about family planning, get some kind of education they\u2019re going to live the same lives as their parents.\nNo end to the cycle without lifting their eyes, without making it possible for girls to attend school!\nWhy just girls?\nWell, because in most low-income countries, for every 100 boys who go into tertiary education, 55 girls stay at home!\nWhy is that?\nFind out in the summary of the next chapter.\nChapter 5 | The Silent Inequality: Unpaid Work\nAs we said above, the picture is even bigger than family planning and education. And that\u2019s because even educated women have the misfortune of facing thousands and thousands of hurdles in the world of work.\nBut, yet again, we\u2019re not merely talking about \n; we\u2019re talking about something Melinda Gates refers to as \u201cthe silent inequality,\u201d i.e., unpaid work.\nKanpur may be a poor neighborhood inhabited by the most conservative of people, so one would expect for women\u2014and even girls\u2014to carry out all the errands, including childcare itself.\nBut India is a powerhouse.\nAnd yet, the data says that Indian men engage in only one hour of unpaid work on a daily basis, while women engage in no less than six!\nAnd the same holds true even for the richest countries in the world!\nIn the United States, for example, women engage in unpaid work at least one and a half hour more than men\u2014on a daily basis.\nThat means that during any given week, women work one workday more than men\u2014which makes all the difference \n if they are paid equally for the rest of their work (which, oftentimes, are \n).\nHow are we supposed to mend this?\nInspired by Marylin Waring\u2019s exceptionally important book titled \n, economist Diane Elson devised the 3R framework to shrink the gender gap regarding unpaid work.\nIts three steps are quite simple when you think about it:\n#1: We should start by \n that unpaid work is being done; that, of course, means that governments should start counting the hours both men and women spend in unpaid work;\n#2. Afterward, we should work our best to \n the number of unpaid work hours, using modern technology (not only cookstoves and washing machines but also breast pumps);\n#3. Finally, we need to \n the work we can\u2019t reduce so that men and women share it more equitably.\nSounds like a nice plan, doesn\u2019t it?\nChapter 6 | When a Girl Has No Voice: Child Marriage\nDo you know what is the number one cause of death for girls aged 15 to 19 worldwide?\nBelieve it or not, going through childbirth!\nWhy would that be a problem, you ask?\nOf course, because it\u2019s happening in low-income and emerging economies; but, also, because tradition works hand in hand with poverty to make these things happen.\nWhat precisely do we have in mind?\nTwo words: child marriage.\nSo widespread phenomenon that about a third of girls living in emerging economies are married off as teenagers; even worse, every tenth girl in these countries has a husband before turning even 15!\nWhy?\nBecause, unlike a son, a daughter can be married off for money, which makes her marriage a double boon for her family: more money, and one less child to take care of.\nAdd to that biased traditions devised in some times when empathy was barely even a word, and you get a certain recipe for disaster.\n\u201cTradition without discussion kills moral progress,\u201d writes Melinda Gates.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re handed a tradition and decide not to talk about it\u2014just do it\u2014then you\u2019re letting people from the past tell you what to do. It kills the chance to see the blind spots in the tradition\u2014and moral blind spots always take the form of excluding others and ignoring their pain.\u201d\nOn the other hand:\nAnd that\u2019s what the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, in partnership with Tostan, and Dutch Princess Mabel van Oranje\u2019s foundation \u201cGirls Not Brides\u201d are constantly doing.\nHopefully, in a very recent future, child marriages will be a thing of the past, and girls will be allowed to choose their husbands, and their next career moves even in poorer countries.\nChapter 7 | Seeing Gender Bias: Women in Agriculture\nIn 2015, during another one of Melinda Gates\u2019 visits to Malawi, she met a farmer named Patricia, so dedicated to her seeds and crops that she\u2014and she alone from her whole farming community\u2014spent Christmas Day in a field a mile away from the celebrations, \u201ckneeling on the damp earth in her half-acre farm plot, planting groundnuts.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d think that someone with Patricia\u2019s dedication would be hugely successful,\u201d writes Melinda Gates, \u201cbut for years, she had struggled.\u201d\nWhy?\nYou\u2019ve guessed it alright: because she is a woman with the misfortune of being born in sub-Saharan Africa!\nWhat does this mean in practice?\nWell, first of all, women in Malawi are not allowed to inherit land, which means that Patricia has to pay rent for her field; secondly, no matter how dedicated she is, if she needs additional farming supplies, she would have to ask for her husband\u2019s permission, because she\u2014as most of the Malawi women\u2014has no control over the family\u2019s money.\nThe result?\nIn spite of Patricia\u2019s painstaking work, even the basics had been out of reach for her and her family. Not only she didn\u2019t have money for school fees for her kids, but she also didn\u2019t have money to buy a set of cooking pots, let alone something more.\nFortunately, the CARE Pathways, a program dedicated to teaching agricultural techniques and gender equality in agriculture, spelled the way out of this dreadful situation for both Patricia and her family. \nAfter they both attended, her husband started listening to her more, and Patricia was able to buy better seeds. This quadrupled her crop yield and allowed her to send her children to school. Inspired by her, other women joined in.\nThat\u2019s merely the beginning of course: if women in agriculture are empowered the way Patricia is, the resulting food surplus could lift 150 million people out of hunger and poverty.\nAnd now you know why Melinda Gates and the BMGF is interested in agriculture!\nChapter 8 | Creating a New Culture: Women in the Workplace\nIn 1987, when Melinda Gates graduated, 35% of IT graduates in the USA were women; nowadays, it\u2019s only 19%.\nAccording to her, there are many reasons for the drop, but the three most important ones are gender biased:\n#1. PCs were usually marketed as gaming devices for boys, so boys spent more time in front of them than girls in the early days;\n#2. The ideal computer coder is often seen as someone with no outside interests or social skills (hence, this often screens out women much more than men);\n#3. And finally\u2014and most terrifyingly\u2014managers hired many more women for IT-related jobs when programming was seen as clerical in nature, and hire many more men nowadays when it is understood as something more complex.\nAnother reason is the staggering fact that only 2% of venture capital partners are women, and only 2% of venture capital money is going to women-founded ventures! \nThis is the reason why Melinda Gates is investing in specialized venture capital funds\u2014such as Aspect Ventures\u2014that invest in companies led by women or people of color.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t charity on my part,\u201d notes Gates.\n\u201cI expect a good return, and I\u2019m confident I\u2019ll get one because women are going to see markets that men won\u2019t see, and black and Latina and Asian women will see markets that white entrepreneurs won\u2019t see. I think we\u2019ll look back in ten years and see it was crazy that more money wasn\u2019t flowing toward markets understood by women and people of color.\u201d\nRemember the Hammurabi Code as described by Harari in \n?\nIf not, here\u2019s a reminder: according to the Code, one eye of a male commoner was worth twice the life of a female commoner.\nWhy?\nWell, because the Code was written by men.\nAnd that should explain to you more about Melinda Gates\u2019 decision to invest in Aspect Ventures than anything else.\n\u201cIf societies are going to elevate women to equality with men\u2014and declare that people of any race or religion have the same rights as anyone else\u2014then we have to have men and women and every racial and religious group together writing the code,\u201d writes Gates.\nAnd then she gives the best argument for diversity we\u2019ve ever read: \u201cDiversity is the best way to defend equality.\u201d\n\u201cIf people from diverse groups are not making the decisions,\u201d Melinda clarifies things, \u201cthe burdens and benefits of society will be divided unequally and unfairly\u2014with the people writing the rules ensuring themselves a greater share of the benefits and a lesser share of the burdens of any society.\u201d\n\u201cNo group should have to trust another to protect their interests,\u201d she concludes; \u201call should be able to speak for themselves. \u201c\nHighlight that, and never forget it.\nChapter 9 | Let Your Heart Break: The Lift of Coming Together\nAfter returning once again to Hans Rosling and his last lesson given to Melinda Gates, the final chapter of \nbrings the author\u2019s discussion to a worthy closure.\n\u201cEvery issue in this book is a door women must walk through, or a wall we must break through,\u201d she writes, \u201cto become full contributors.\u201d\nWhether it is the right for women to decide whether and when to have children, to marry or not marry, to seek opportunity, attend a university, control their income, manage their time, pursue their goals, and/or advance in the workplace\u2014women need to meet, talk, organize and lead, so that they can break down the walls and open the doors for \n.\nOf course, a casual reader might read into this paragraph something akin to exclusion. \nWell, what about the men? he might ask.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying we should include women and girls \n men and boys,\u201d answers Gates, \u201cbut \n. This is not about bringing women in and leaving others out.

Millions don\u2019t have the right to go to school or earn an income. \nSome are forbidden to work outside the home or even \n outside the home\u2014which results in so many women worldwide not having enough money let alone their own space (\n).\nStarting a business, owning a property, running for office, finding inventors\u2014you name the right, millions of women don\u2019t have it!\nEven when they\u2019re allowed by law!\nWhy Melinda Gates Speaks Up for Women\nIf the reasons above are not enough for you, here\u2019s the story behind \n.\nMelinda Gates started her philanthropic journey two decades ago as an advocate of family planning, believing that contraception would solve so many problems of the women around the world.\nHowever, as time passed, she learned that this is merely the start. It did help a lot, but women were still denied the right to education, with 13 million girls being forced into marriages before reaching the age of 15 on a yearly basis.\nAnd what about owning some land, being paid for household chores, or doing away with the gender-biased work atmosphere?\n\u201cI quickly realized\u2014because I was quickly \n\u2014that it wasn\u2019t enough to speak up for family planning,\u201d writes Melinda Gates. \u201cI had to speak up for women. And I soon saw that if we are going to take our place as equals with men, it won\u2019t come from winning our rights one by one or step by step; we\u2019ll win our rights in waves as we become empowered. \u201c\nThe Policies of Inclusion vs. The Culture of Exclusion\nSpeaking up for women, however, is not easy.\nIn fact, it is always very difficult to speak for the ones who are excluded\u2014be they women, people of color, the poor, the immigrants, the marginalized sexual communities.\nWhy?\nBecause the ones who have excluded them are most probably the ones who are in power.\nSo, your job is to make the people who\u2019ve built their power by developing a culture of exclusion to start implementing policies of inclusion.\nOf course it\u2019s not going to happen very soon.\nBut it must happen\u2014and Melinda Gates is all about putting the wheels in motion today!\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Moment of Lift Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nAcclaimed by both its professional and casual reviewers, \nhas been endorsed by just about everybody from Barack Obama to Malala.Described as \u201can urgent call to courage\u201d by \n and a \u201clesson in listening\u201d by \n, \nis, indeed, \u201ca timely and necessary call to action for women\u2019s empowerment,\u201d as its blurb states.\n\n"},

Freeman has a simple piece of advice: \nJust do \n.\nWho Should Read \u201cThe Next Right Thing\u201d? And Why?\nEmily P. Freeman is a devoted Christian, so there\u2019s a good chance that those who are not will find many of her recommendations and suggestions not only inapplicable but also even useless.\nHowever, even they should be able to extract some guidance from this book. Even if merely the importance of the main lesson \u2013 doing the next right thing \u2013 that may be enough to make them more decisive.\nAbout Emily P. Freeman\n is an American writer, creative director, and spiritual mentor.\nCo-founder of the hopewriters.com community, Freeman has been writing online for over a decade.\nIn addition, she has also authored several Christian-themed books, two of which \u2013 \n and \n \u2013 topped the \nbestseller list.\nFind out more at \n. \n\u201cThe Next Right Thing PDF Summary\u201d\nAs Emily P. Freeman notes in the first chapter of \n,\n\u201cthis is a book about making decisions.\u201d\nConsequently, it is also a book \u2013 as she adds almost instantly \u2013 \u201cabout making a life\u201d:\nFreeman invites you, as you read her book, to bring to your mind those areas in life where you do have a choice, no matter how small (\n).\nAnd also \u2013 to do the next right thing.\nDo the Next Right Thing: The Wisdom of Jesus\nIn Luke 5, Jesus performs two well-known miracles: he cleanses a leper and heals a paralytic at Capernaum; and in Luke 8, he adds an even greater one: he raises Jairus\u2019 daughter from the dead.\nNow, after such miracles, you\u2019d expect Jesus to have some very wise words for the cured (and \n, as readers), but the only things he actually says to them are: \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest\u201d (to the leper), \u201cI tell you, get up, take your mat and go home\u201d (to the paralyzed man), and \u201cGive her something to eat\u201d (to Jairus and his wife).\nEmily P. Freeman thinks that there\u2019s, in fact, an enormous amount of wisdom in these three very simple pieces of advice.\nWhy?\nBecause they all boil down to one universal remedy, \n advice her book is built upon: \n.\n\u201cRather than a life plan, a clear vision or a five-year list of goals, the leper, the paralytic, and Jairus and his wife were given clear instructions by Jesus about what to do next \u2013 and only \n\u201d writes Freeman. \nAnd then she wonders if Jesus knew something about our \u201caddiction to clarity,\u201d and whether what he wanted to say to these people was something stated in The Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous:\n\u201cWe earnestly pray for the right ideal, for guidance in each questionable situation, for sanity, and for the strength to do the right thing.\u201d\nIn other words, most of us make our present choices based on a plan about the future; and quite a long and clear plan, indeed.\nHowever, clear plans never work out, and none of us is capable of living in the future.\nSo, why don\u2019t we start making decisions regardless of it?\nBecome a Soul Minimalist\n\u201cMinimalism is not that you should own nothing,\u201d wrote Joshua Becker in \n. \u201cBut that nothing should own you.\u201d\nWell, Emily P. Freeman notes, this should not be read as merely \n, but also as a decision-making dictum.\nNo matter what choice you make in life, there\u2019s a good chance that \nare not the one making it; in other words, that there are thousands and thousands of distractions which have influenced your decision.\nThink of it this way: if you don\u2019t know which brand of tissues you\u2019re going to buy \u2013 studies have shown \u2013 you buy the one that first pops into your mind. The problem is that this choice has been imprinted in your brain by commercials and Google Ads, and quite a few cheeky psychological tricks the guys who make and place them know by hear.\nIn other words, you \nyou\u2019re the one making a choice, but, instead, your choice has been made by you.\nHow to change this?\nWell, it\u2019s not that difficult, in fact: just eliminate all the distractions.\nStart with disabling notifications on your phone; that way, you\u2019ll be more present in the \n world, you know, the one \n around you. Next, move on to phase 2: silence.\nUnable to recognize the little voice telling you all sorts of things in the silence?\nNews flash: it\u2019s you!\nIt was about time!\nName the Narrative\nNow, silence and distraction-less surroundings are often not enough; and that voice inside you suggesting choices is not enough either.\nWhy?\nBecause that voice has been muffled out so very long time that it may be overwhelmed by the fact that it will finally be heard by the one person it should be heard by!\nThe effect?\nWell, it may not sound clear, but rather like a tuned-out radio station. And we, Westerners, don\u2019t like lack of clarity!\n\u201cOur Western minds are trained to go down the path of explaining,\u201d writes Freeman. \u201cWe think if we can understand it, then we can control it\u2026 We are conditioned to believe the only reason we should do things is if we know why, where we are headed, and for what purpose. No wonder we have trouble making decisions. If we don\u2019t have clear answers or sure things, then taking a big step feels like a risk at best and a wasteful mistake at worst.\u201d\nFreeman thinks she knows the problem:\nFortunately, the solution is rather simple: just name the damn thing!\n\u201cThere is power in naming the unnamed things,\u201d notes Freeman. \u201cThis is an important part of our decision-making practice and key to taking our next right step in love. Remember today is a plot point. See it honestly for what it is, but don\u2019t confuse the moment for the whole story.\u201d\nAsk This Question Before Every Hard Decision\n\u201cSooner strangle an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires,\u201d wrote William Blake in his \n, warning everybody of something psychologists would discover much later: unacted desires turn into something bad and ugly, whether frustration, anger or fear.\nIn time, this results in something strange: your real desires are clouded by these negative feelings, and instead of embracing them, you\u2019re actually running away from them.\nThat\u2019s why, in the silence of your distraction-less surroundings, you should always ask yourself one crucial question before making any difficult decision: \u201cam I being led by love or pushed by fear?\u201d\nYou want an example?\nHere\u2019s one from the author\u2019s life.\nIn 2011, Freeman was supposed to travel with the Christian aid organization Compassion International to the Philippines.\nNow, she had a few valid excuses to turn down the offer: she was, for example, drafting two books at the time, and they weren\u2019t going to write themselves.\nHowever, there was something that bugged her: it seemed that these valid excuses were not the real reason why she wanted to turn down the offer.\nAnd then, through a long and meaningful discussion, the trip leader from Compassion International helped Emily realize what was really happening: she had masked her love to participate in the mission with her fear of flying.\nBut merely naming it and realizing that it was a \u201cfear vs. love situation,\u201d gave Emily the necessary strength to do the next right thing.\n\u201cDesire often lives next door to grief inside the soul,\u201d she concludes. \u201cAccess the grief, and you wake up the longing as well.\u201d\nMake the Most Important List\nIf \u201cam I being led by love or pushed by fear?\u201d is the most important decision-making question you should learn, then making a Life Energy List is certainly the most important decision-making activity you should start doing.\nWhat is a Life Energy List, you ask?\nSimply put, a Life Energy List is a review of the past quarter of your life, which should help you organize the next one.\nIt consists of asking yourself two questions:\n\u2022 What gave you energy during the past three months?\n\u2022 What left you without it during the same period?\nYou can use \n to not only list the things you did in the appropriate columns, but also grade them accordingly (how much energy did each of one gave or took out of you).\nNow, that you know \u2013 and in order to \n know, you must be completely and utterly honest to yourself \u2013 you have more than a vague idea what to do and what not to during the next three months of your life.\nAnd then?\nWell, then it\u2019s time for another Life Energy List.\nSome Other Pieces of Advice\nabounds with practical pieces of advice such as the five illustrated above.\nThe book has 24 short chapters, and almost each of them offers a different type of guidance (regularly coupled with a clarifying experience taken from the author\u2019s life), with all of them pointing in the same direction: how to do the \n right thing.\nFor the purposes of our summary, we chose to recap the five that seemed most interesting and applicable to us.\nHowever, it would be a wrong idea to ignore the rest.\nHere are a few of them:\n\u2022 \n: enough with the self-help books and the mentors: paradoxically, your decision-making capacities are crippled by the plethora of instructions; even if they are good, they prevent you from actually \n something; look at it this way: if most of your mentors are good, then there\u2019s a better way than finding new ones: just choose one and follow him.\n\u2022\neven better, gather co-listeners rather than gurus; people who listen are a rarity nowadays, so when you find them, be sure to never lose them (and, of course, to consult them whenever possible).\n\u2022 \n: as we said above, sometimes things aren\u2019t clear enough; however, rushing clarity is the wrong way to get out of these quandaries; be patient and contemplate things until they become clearer; and, if you are religious like Emily, wait for God\u2019s signs (or\narrows, as\nshe calls them);\n\u2022 \n: even if you\u2019re not religious, sometimes clarity comes in all sorts of unexpected ways; some call them signs, others surprises; be that as it may, they are helpful; much more than going over the same things again and again.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Next Right Thing\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Everybody Makes a Lot of Decisions (on a Daily Basis)\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Decision-Making 101: Do the \n Right Thing\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The One Question You Should Ask Yourself Before Making a Difficult Decision\nEverybody Makes a Lot of Decisions (on a Daily Basis)\nWe don\u2019t need to tell you that you make an abundance of decisions throughout your life. \nHowever, have you ever wondered how much?\nWell, according to conservative estimations, no less than 35,000. \nA day!\nA Cornell University study discovered something even more fascinating: the average American makes 200 daily decisions on food alone.\nDecision-Making 101: Do the Next Right Thing\nNow, even though most of these 35,000 decisions are mindless, at least a few of them are life-changing; and, unfortunately, just too, too difficult.\nWhat should you do?\nWell, according to Emily P. Freeman \u2013 not to mention Jesus, the AA, or everybody from Mother Teresa to Martin Luther King Jr., from Theodore Roosevelt to Anne Lamott \u2013 it\u2019s quite simple: just do the \n right thing.\nWhat does this mean in practice?\nQuite simply, instead of putting things in perspective and deciding what you should do next in relation to your desired future in five or ten years, just do the next thing based on your present situation.\nWhat if it is not clear enough, you ask?\nWell, wait for it to clear!\nThe One Question You Should Ask Yourself Before Making a Difficult Decision\nIt\u2019s quite simple, really: \u201cam I being led by love or pushed by fear?\u201d\nIn the silence of your room, shielded away from distractions such as Facebook notifications and mobile phones, this question is the right place to start thinking over every important decision.\nYou know why?\nBecause, more often than not, we mask our desires with negative emotions and don\u2019t really know what we want on the go.\nThis way, you can find out.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Next Right Thing Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nEven though, as Kendra Adachi (founder of The Lazy Genius Collective) has justly noted, \u201cEmily P.

And Why?\nis a parenting book, which means that it is aimed at parents, especially new parents. \nHowever, this is one book which should not only make the children better adults but also the parents better people.\nBut, then again, these two things should be connected, shouldn\u2019t they?\nAbout Esther Wojcicki\n is an American journalist, educator, and Founder of the Palo Alto High School Media Arts Program in Palo Alto, CA.\nConsidered one of the foremost educators of the 20\n century, she has won numerous pedagogical awards including the 2002 California Teacher of the Year by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, and the 2011 Charles O\u2019Malley Award from Columbia Scholastic Press.\nKnown for \u201cMoonshots: The Woj Way Pedagogical Philosophy (Trust Framework),\u201d Wojcicki was awarded an honorary doctorate from Palo Alto University in 2013. \nis her first book.\n\u201cHow to Raise Successful People PDF Summary\u201d\n\u201cThere are no Nobel Prizes for parenting or education, but there should be,\u201d writes Esther Wojcicki in the first sentence of \n. \u201cThey are the two most important things we do in our society. How we raise and educate our children determines not only the people they become but the society we create.\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s a reason why you should believe Wojcicki, or WOJ as she is known to many of her friends and admirers: she is not only a legendary educator and, unofficially, \u201cThe Godmother of Silicon Valley,\u201d she is also, very official, the exemplary mother of a Super Family.\nWhat does that mean?\nWell, let\u2019s just say that, in her family, you really don\u2019t know who has achieved more.\nTogether with her husband, Stanford University professor of physics, Stanley Wojcicki, Esther has raised three exceptionally talented daughters: Anne (co-founder and CEO of 23andMe), Janet, a Fulbright-winning anthropologist, and Susan, YouTube\u2019s CEO.\nWant to learn how to raise children like \n?\nRead on!\nThe Childhood You Wish You\u2019d Had\nWhen Esther Wojcicki starts the chapter with the title above with \u201cwe all tend to parent the way we were parented,\u201d one cannot be blamed for thinking that she had wonderful parents.\nThat is, however, not the case: \u201cwhen I became a mother,\u201d she goes on, \u201cthe one thing I knew for sure was that I didn\u2019t want to repeat the mistakes of my parents.\u201d\nThe oldest of the three children of two Russian Jewish immigrants, Wojcicki grew up in a family where religious beliefs and practices decided every aspect of upbringing.\nIf you know anything about Orthodox Jewish families, you certainly already know that, in this tradition (as, unfortunately, in many others), women have one clearly defined role: mother of the family. \n\u201cThat means women don\u2019t need an education,\u201d writes Wojcicki. \u201cThey only need to know how to take care of the children and their husband, and how to maintain a household.\u201d\nCase in point: when Esther\u2019s brother Lee was born (on May 23, 1945, five years after her), she was told by her father something rather shocking: \u201cYour brother Lee is a boy, and in our family boys are more important.\u201d\nEsther\u2019s father wasn\u2019t one who only talked the talk: he made this perfectly clear by walking the walk as well: while Lee was showered with presents and attention, Esther was merely watching from the sidelines.\n\u201cPart of what helped me cope,\u201d says Esther in retrospect, \u201cwas the constant love of my mother; she was patient, never critical, and she made me feel important despite what my father had said.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, much of Esther\u2019s parenting philosophy is based on avoiding the mistakes her father had made and repeating the good things her mother had done.\nTRICK Is the Trick\n\u201cI may have figured out a lot on my own,\u201d says Wojcicki, \u201cbut I\u2019m the first to admit that parenting would have been much easier with some guidance. So that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to offer you here \u2013 guidance,\u201d she concludes.\nAnd she writes:\nLet\u2019s look at each of these values in detail.\nTrust\nJust recently, we summarized David Brooks\u2019 immensely important book, \n \nIf you have already read that summary (by all means, you should), you are familiar with the depth and extent of the \u201cfour interrelated social crises of modernity.\u201d\nOne of them is distrust, best exemplified by the fact that less than a fifth of millennials believe that most people are trustworthy \u2013 a serious \u00a0drop compared to the 1950s; and, yes \u2013 those surveys came after a great war!\n\u201cThe digital age and the ease of transmitting information has resulted in a crisis of trust,\u201d writes Wojcicki, \u201cand it\u2019s affecting the way we live and the way we parent.\u201d\nThe problem?\nIf you want your child to grow up in a trustworthy adult, and if you want it to believe in his/her capabilities, then it\u2019s crucial that you start believing other people.\nWhy?\nBecause only that way you\u2019ll allow your children to start roaming freely and experience things, and prevent them from internalizing your distrust.\n\u201cAs parents, we have to take ourselves in hand and trust that we taught our children to make good decisions,\u201d writes Wojcicki. \u201cWe have to trust the basic goodness of people and the basic goodness of the world. And sometimes, our children can be our greatest teachers.\u201d\nRespect\nThe only subtitle of this section of Wojcicki\u2019s \nis, really, all you need to know when it comes to respect: your child is not your clone.\nTake, for example, Greg, \u201ca genius in graphic design\u201d who Wojcicki had the privilege of teaching journalism.\nThe problem?\nGreg\u2019s father was a physician, and his mother was a medical researcher. \u201cThe very last thing they wanted their son to become was some creative type,\u201d informs us Wojcicki. \u201cHe was supposed to be a doctor, a lawyer, or \u2013 best of all \u2013 a scientist.\u201d\nOf course, since Greg was sixteen at the time, his parents chose his courses for him. And even though he wasn\u2019t that great in his science classes, for some reason, these were the ones he attended.\nAfter some time, this resulted in him feeling depressed, withdrawn, and disinterested in absolutely everything.\nFortunately, Greg overcame this and eventually became a well-known graphic artist and web designer who currently runs a successful company in Los Angeles.\nHowever, another student of Esther named Lisa wasn\u2019t that lucky: instead of becoming a teacher, she became a doctor (her parents\u2019 wish) and is still unhappy. \nAnd if you have ever watched \n, you know that these kinds of stories may end even worse than this.\n\u201cChildren will listen to you \u2013 they want your approval and love \u2013 but if they want to be happy, they\u2019re going to have to listen to themselves,\u201d says Wojcicki.\nThat\u2019s what she did after her daughter Anne announced to her that she had no intention of pursuing a professional career (after graduating from Yale!) and wanted, instead, to become a babysitter.\nEsther allowed her daughter to lead the way, and, eventually, it paid off: \n.\nIndependence\nTrust and respect are the foundation of the third trait of good parenting: independence:\n\u201cChildren who learn self-control and responsibility early in life are much better equipped to face the challenges of adulthood, and also have the skills to innovate and think creatively,\u201d writes Wojcicki. \u201cTruly independent kids are capable of coping with adversity, setbacks, and boredom, all unavoidable aspects of life. They feel in control even when things around them are in chaos.\u201d\nMost of us think that independence is something children officially acquire after their 18\n birthday. However, this is a very wrong way to think about things.\nTruly independent adults are formed in early childhood and to help them become such you need to follow two pieces of advice: 1) don\u2019t do anything for your children that they can do for themselves; and 2) give your children grit.\nIf you know what we mean by 2, you have Angela Duckworth to thank for. And that\u2019s because, in her succinctly titled 2014 book, \n, Duckworth revealed to the world something rather interesting: passion and perseverance are more important than innate talents.\nIn other words, the ones who make it are the ones who have set clear goals before themselves, and have the energy to stride toward their completion; even in Auschwitz, \n, the ones who survived were the ones with goals and determination.\nNow, to give your children grit, you need to learn to allow them to do \n they can do by themselves; even if you \n help them.\nIndependence starts there.\nBecause with doing things inevitably comes failure to do some of them; and with that, just as inevitably, comes the determination to try again, aka grit.\nIn short, failure in early years results in grit; in later \u2013 in depression.\nCollaboration\nJulie Lythcott-Haims says that \n: authoritarian (demanding and unresponsive), permissive (undemanding and responsive), neglectful (undemanding and unresponsive), and authoritative (demanding and responsive).\nWe don\u2019t need to tell you that neglectful parenting is the worst kind, but we feel that we do need to remind you that permissive parenting allows children too much.\nAnd, as studies have demonstrated over and over again, children \n some structure!\nPsychologist Diana Baumrind discovered this in two separate studies (from 1971 and 1991) which demonstrated that children with demanding parents are less likely to become involved in drugs and similar delinquent behaviors during adolescence.\nHowever, as described above, there\u2019s a big difference between \nand \nstyle of parenting: the first one is the one practiced by Wojcicki\u2019s father, and the second one the one advised by many psychologists in the world.\nIn other words, you need to be demanding of your child, but, moreover, you need to be responsive as well.\nEsther goes a step further and introduces a new, fifth type of parenting: collaborative. It is the one in which the parent works with the child constantly, about all things and matters.\nFor comparison, an authoritarian parent would choose the color for his/her child\u2019s bedroom and have it painted too; an authoritative one would choose the color and then instruct the child on how to paint it; a collaborative one, finally, would both choose the color and paint the bedroom with the help of his/her child.\n\u201cCollaboration means working together as a family, in a classroom, or at a workplace,\u201d writes Wojcicki. \u201cFor parents, it means encouraging children to contribute to discussions, decisions, and even discipline\u2026 We shouldn\u2019t be telling our children what to do, but asking for their ideas and working together to find solutions.\u201d\nKindness\nLet us start the final trick in the Parenting TRICK manual with a very enlightening quote by Wojcicki:\nNow, let\u2019s go back once again to David Brooks\u2019 \n(we told you it is an important book, didn\u2019t we?)\nIn it, the author expresses his deep concern about the future of humanity in the land of radical individualism: the United States.\nWe don\u2019t even need to analyze why: individualists care for themselves more than they care for the ones around them; and communities are built on the very opposite: togetherness.\nWojcicki comments upon this sad state of affairs through the results of a study done by researchers at the Harvard Graduate School of Education: the Making Caring Common Project.\nA survey of 10,000 children \u2013 mind you, children! \u2013 discovered that 80% of them identified achievement or happiness as their top priority, and only 20% said the same about \u201ccaring for others.\u201d\nBut if everybody cares for himself/herself and not for others, then how are we going to build a human society?\nZoom in a little bit and the same goes for families: it\u2019s either \u201cone for all, and all for one,\u201d or the demise of the nuclear family as we know it! \nKey Lessons from \u201cHow to Raise Successful People\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Trick of Good Parenting Is TRICK\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Independence Relies Upon a Strong Foundation of Trust and Respect\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collaborative Parenting Is All About Kindness and Understanding\nThe Trick of Good Parenting Is TRICK\nTRICK is an acronym which stands for trust, respect, independence, collaboration, and kindness.\nAnd in Esther Wojcicki\u2019s mind, it is also the simple (and, thanks to her, easy-to-remember) recipe for good parenting.\nIndependence Relies Upon a Strong Foundation of Trust and Respect\nDistrust and disrespect breed distrust and disrespect; trust and respect breed independence.\nIt\u2019s as simple as that!\nIf you don\u2019t allow your child to roam freely and explore the world by itself (helicopter parenting), then it will certainly internalize this distrust and grow an untrusty parent itself. If you disrespect his/her choices, it may get even worse (this is one of the main causes of depression and suicides).\nHowever, if you are trustworthy and respectful, your child will grow into just that kind of adult. And this is the difference between independent and needy children.\nCollaborative Parenting Is All About Kindness and Understanding\nMost parenting books advise authoritative parenting, which is different from authoritarian parenting in that it is both demanding and responsive (authoritarian is unresponsive).\nHowever, Esther Wojcicki suggests a new kind of parenting: a collaborative one.\nCollaborative parenting is all about the TRICK values; it\u2019s doing things with your children \nby showing them how to do them, but by doing them \n them.\nIt\u2019s about showing kindness and putting the needs of your children first; finally, it\u2019s about understanding that allowing your children to lead the way from time to time is the best thing you can do.\nThey might teach you things such as trust, kindness, and respect \u2013 you know, the trick to being a better person!\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cHow to Raise Successful People Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\n should really be titled \n because, throughout the book, that seems like Esther\u2019s main objective. \nUnlike Amy Chou, Wojcicki thinks that a successful adult is just that: an independent, trustworthy, respectful, and kind person.\nAnd her book will teach you how to help your children grow up like that; the successes of her children is evidence enough that her parenting methods really work."},

Yalom\u2019s open letter to all therapists and patients out there:\n.\nWho Should Read \u201cThe Gift of Therapy\u201d? And Why?\nis primarily a book targeting therapists: especially those who already know something about Yalom and existential therapy and are familiar with the theoretical aspects of the practice.\nHowever, the very fact that it is not systematic and structured makes it a great introductory book for patients to psychotherapy: if therapists train themselves to look through your window, here\u2019s your chance to look through theirs.\nYou may see a healthier you from the other side.\nAbout Irvin D. Yalom\n is an American existential psychotherapist, emeritus professor of psychiatry at Stanford University, and a bestselling author of both non-fiction and fiction books.\nBorn to Russian parents in Washington D.C., Yalom developed a personal model of existential psychotherapy in the 1970s and his 1980 book \nis considered the classical introduction to the form.\nHe has written as many fiction as non-fiction books, the most famous of which, \n, was adapted into a movie in 2007.\nFind out more at \n. \n\u201cThe Gift of Therapy PDF Summary\u201d\nFirst published in 2001 \u2013 sometime around the author\u2019s 70\n birthday \u2013 \n, as stated by its blurb, is \u201cthe culmination of master psychiatrist Dr. Irvin D. Yalom\u2019s more than forty-five years in clinical practice.\u201d\nAnd despite the fact that, at 87, Yalom is still alive and kicking in 2019, and, has written six more books in the meantime in addition to seeing at least two documentaries made about him, \n also feels as a kind of a testament.\nAs poignant as essential, Yalom\u2019s book \u2013 which has gone through several edition since its first publication \u2013 can be described as a collection of advices given by someone who has come to the end of his journey as a psychotherapist and now looks back to discover the highs and lows and so that he can pass on his knowledge to a new generation of psychotherapists.\nConsequently, it\u2019s no wonder that the book consists of 85 chapters, most of them no longer than two or three pages, and each one focusing on an important aspect of Yalom\u2019s works and beliefs. \nIn the \u201cIntroduction,\u201d Yalom provides a tentative structure of his book; naturally, we\u2019ll try to follow it in our summary.\nIntroduction\n\u201cIt is daunting to realize that I am entering a designated later era of life,\u201d writes one of America\u2019s leading psychotherapists, Irvin D. Yalom, at the beginning of \n. \n\u201cMy goals, interests, and ambitions are changing in predictable fashion,\u201d he adds, implying that if in the past his job was to take and teach patients, now his goal is to guide and inspire a new generation of psychotherapists.\nHowever, he says, this is exceedingly problematic today, because, in Yalom\u2019s opinion, the field in serious crisis.\n\u201cAn economically driven health-care system,\u201d he writes, \u201cmandates a radical modification in psychological treatment, and psychotherapy is now obliged to be streamlined \u2013 that is, above all, \n and, perforce, brief, superficial, and insubstantial.\u201d\nConsequently, Yalom is worried that what he leaves behind is a world in which psychotherapy is seen as just another job from which someone is to make a profit, rather than a humane discipline whose sole objective is to help people \u2013 regardless of the cost.\nHe writes, movingly:\nAnd yet, Yalom concludes, if not only because of this endangered species (or exactly because there are so few of them), it makes sense to write a book such as \n.\n\u201cSince first entering the field of psychiatry,\u201d Yalom says, \u201cI have had two abiding interests: group therapy and existential therapy.\u201d\nThese two are parallel interests, but, nevertheless, they are also separate: as Yalom says, just as there can be no group therapy for one person, there\u2019s also no such thing as existential group therapy. \nThe two things differ in their \n.\nIn groups, Yalom\u2019s frame of reference is \n and is based on the assumption that patients \u201cfall into despair because of their inability to develop and sustain gratifying interpersonal relationships.\u201d\nHowever, when Yalom deals with a single patient, he operates within an \n, which is firmly rooted within the conviction that patients fall into despair due to a confrontation with the \u201charsh facts of human condition \u2013 the \u2018givens\u2019 of existence.\u201d\nIf you have problems understanding what existential psychotherapy actually is, Yalom provides a neat definition: \u201cExistential psychotherapy is a dynamic therapeutic approach that focuses on concerns rooted in existence.\u201d\nHowever, a definition makes no sense if you don\u2019t understand the meaning of the words it encompasses.\nSo, here\u2019s the necessary vocabulary to understand Yalom\u2019s existential approach:\n\u2022 \nis a philosophical study of the human being as a thinking, acting, feeling, and living being in search of authentic existence; (to understand this even better, we warmly suggest you read our summaries of \n and \n)\n\u2022 \nis here used in the technical sense, implying that the forces in conflict with the individual \u201cexist at varying levels of awareness; indeed \n.\u201d\n\u2022 Finally, there are four ultimate \n, i.e., four \n: death, isolation, meaning in life, and freedom. \nNow that you have understood the theoretical definition of existential therapy, it\u2019s time that you understand a bit better how it works in practice.\nAnd to do this, first you must make a distinction between two major aspects of therapy discourse: content and process:\n\u2022 \nis just what the word says it is: \u201cthe precise words spoken, the substantive issues addressed.\u201d \n\u2022 \n, on the other hand, refers to the \u201cinterpersonal relationship between the patient and the therapist.\u201d\nIn other and plainer words: it is one thing to explicitly start a discussion about death, isolation, meaning and freedom (content), and a completely another thing to implicitly derive conclusions from stories which seemingly bear no relation to these existential topics.\n\u201cTherapy should not be \n,\u201d writes Yalom, reminding us of \n, \u201cbut \n.\u201d\nIn fact, that\u2019s exactly how this book was born!\nBecause, in theory, you can say that existential psychotherapy is all about the givens of existence, but in practice, it would be both contra-productive and fruitless to force upon a patient a discussion which includes any of them explicitly.\n\u201cA heightened sensibility to existential issues\u201d and awareness of the \n of interpersonal communication is what helps a psychotherapist really understand what do the actual \n of the words of the patients says about them, their health, and their objectives.\nDescribed by Yalom as both \u201ca sequence of tips for therapists,\u201d and \u201ca nuts-and-bolts collection of favorite interventions or statements,\u201d \nis \u201clong on technique and short on theory.\u201d\nConsequently, the book should not be understood and/or used as a \u201csystematic manual,\u201d but as \u201ca supplement to a comprehensive training program.\u201d\nOriginally, it began as a list of more than two hundred pieces of advice only to be pruned away by Yalom to the most essential eighty-five.\nThese are chosen, by Yalom\u2019s own admission, quite haphazardly, but are grouped, as an afterthought, in five tentative sections:\n\u2022 \n (therapist-patient relationship): first 40 chapters;\n\u2022 \n: chapters 41 to 51;\n\u2022 \n: chapters 52 to 76;\n\u2022 \n: chapters 77 to 83; and\n\u2022 \n: the last two chapters.\nProcess (1 \u2013 40)\nHere are the highlights from the first section:\n#1. Remove obstacles to growth;\n#2. Except in extreme cases \u2013 and for insurance companies \u2013 avoid diagnosis: you are talking with a unique human being, not with a general concept;\n#3. Think of your patient as a fellow traveler, not as your follower;\n#4. Engage your patient in a deeply personal relationship through discussion;\n#5. Be supportive;\n#6. Be sympathetic: look out the patient\u2019s window;\n#7. Do not only practice but also \n empathy;\n#8. Let the patient matter to you;\n#9. Acknowledge your errors: mistakes bring people closer;\n#10. Treat all of your patients as individuals: create a new therapy for each of them;\n#11. Talk the talk, but also walk the walk;\n#12. Engage in personal therapy;\n#13. Never forget that while the therapist has many patients, the patient has only one therapist;\n#14 \u2013 #24. Use the Here-and-Now method: your patients are not only their past experience but also what\u2019s happening during the therapy sessions; develop here-and-now rabbit ears by keeping in mind a simple principle (particularly evident in group therapy: \n;\n#25. Forget the blank screen: instead of being a robot, be \nto your patient;\n#26 \u2013 #32. There are three realms of self-disclosure: a) the mechanism of therapy: be transparent; b) revealing here-and-now-feelings: use discretion; and c) revealing the therapist\u2019s own personal life: use caution;\n#33. Avoid the crooked cure;\n#34. If you can \u2013 and it is possible \u2013 take your patients further than you have gone;\n#35. Sometimes allow your patient to help \n;\n#36. Encourage patient self-disclosure;\n#37. Use the Johari window for feedback;\n#38. Provide feedback effectively and gently;\n#39. Increase receptiveness to feedback by using \u201cparts;\u201d\n#40. As far as feedback is concerned \u2013 strike when the iron is cold.\nContent (41 \u2013 51)\nThe second part comprises eleven pieces of advice.\nThe first three (#41 \u2013 #43) concern the first given of existence: \n.\n\u201cThough the physicality of death destroys us,\u201d writes Yalom, \u201cthe idea of death may save us.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why it is important to talk about it.\nIt is discussions about death which help us move from our everyday mode of existence (full of distractions with our material surroundings) to an ontologic mode of being (filled with wonderment and readiness for change).\nYalom\u2019s advice #44 concerns two givens of existence: life meaning and isolation.\nUnlike other beings, humans are unique in the fact that they are meaning-seeking creatures. However, \n, the goal of the journey is the journey itself.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if one finds meaning; what matters is the engagement in the pursuit; and therapists need to remove all isolation-creating obstacles to this engagement. \nAfter this, the book includes several chapters (#45 \u2013 #51) dealing with the last of the givens of existence \u2013 freedom \u2013 and its corollaries: responsibility and decision-making.\nYalom understands freedom in the way most existential philosophers understand it: as a way of assuming responsibility for your life in a chaotic, unstructured world.\nSo as to help your patients achieve this, never reinforce victimhood \u2013 even if nine-tenths of the bad things that happened to them are someone else\u2019s fault, focus on the one-tenth in which their actions mattered.\n is also glanced upon since it is another boundary experience, located somewhere between freedom and death.\nYou\u2019re free to make a decision, but that usually means \nmaking some other decision which means that you\u2019re willingly cutting yourself off from other possibilities.\nThat\u2019s where anxiety stems from \u2013 and therapists need to deal with this appropriately.\nEveryday Therapy (52 \u2013 76)\nThe third section (#52 \u2013 #76) is, not even arguably, the most random one.\nHere, interspersed with examples from his own clinical practice, you\u2019ll find many useful pieces of advice regarding numerous different aspects of psychotherapy.\nHere they are:\n#52. Conduct therapy as a continuous session;\n#53. Take notes of each session;\n#54. Encourage self-monitoring: may your patients take notes as well;\n#55. When your patient weeps, encourage him to go even deeper;\n#56. Give yourself some time for repose between patients;\n#57. Express your dilemmas openly with the patient;\n#58. When you can, do home visits;\n#59. Don\u2019t take explanations too seriously;\n#60. Use therapy-accelerating devices such as the \u201cWho am I\u201d question;\n#61. Consider therapy a dress rehearsal for life;\n#62. Use complaints as leverages;\n#63. Don\u2019t be afraid of touching your patient;\n#64. However, unlike Jung, never be sexual with patients;\n#65. Look for anniversary and life-stage issues;\n#66. Never ignore \u2018therapy anxiety;\u2019\n#67. Ask your patient what you should say to make him feel better;\n#68. Love and therapy are incompatible: \u201cthe good therapist fights darkness and seeks illumination, while romantic love is sustained by mystery and crumbles upon inspection;\u201d\n#69 \u2013 #73. When in need, systematically collect the history of your patient, including interviewing his/her significant other and exploring previous therapy;\n#74. Share the \n with your patient;\n#75. Freud was wrong about many things \u2013 but he was not always wrong;\n#76. Don\u2019t be afraid of the EVT (empirically validated therapy) bogeyman. \nDreams (77 \u2013 83)\nNext on Yalom\u2019s agenda: the interpretation of dreams.\nOf course, he advises therapists to use dreams in their sessions; however, he\u2019s not that keen on a deep, full interpretation such as the \n.\nUse dreams pragmatically: first master some dream navigational skills, then pay attention to the narrative and then pillage and loot through them!\nHazards and Privileges (84 \u2013 85)\nIn the last two chapters, Yalom unearths the occupational hazards and privileges of being a therapist.\nAs far as the former ones are concerned, you need to be careful of a few dangers:\n\u2022 First of all, you need to try hard not to isolate yourself from others: therapists are sometimes just too solitary creatures;\n\u2022 Secondly, find nourishment in your friends and family; otherwise, you\u2019ll too become anxious and confront problems;\n\u2022 Nevertheless, be aware that some patient difficulties can \u2013 and sometimes \n\u2013 disrupt your life and may cause relationship strains and even thoughts of suicide;\n\u2022 If so, attend support groups for therapists: apparently, this exists as well.\nWhy bother being a therapist if this is the cost?\nWell, Yalom has an answer for that in the final chapter:\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Gift of Therapy\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Existential and Group Therapy\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Four Givens of Existence\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Therapists Are Descendants of Jesus and Buddha\nExistential and Group Therapy\nIrvin Yalom practices two types of therapy: existential and group therapy.\nThe former is reserved for individuals and is \u201ca dynamic therapeutic approach that focuses on concerns rooted in existence;\u201d it is based on the assumption that despair is the result of a personal confrontation with the givens of existence.\nGroup therapy is interpersonal and operates within the idea that patients \u201cfall into despair because of their inability to develop and sustain gratifying interpersonal relationships.\u201d\nThe Four Givens of Existence\nAccording to existential psychotherapy, there are four givens of existence: death, isolation, meaning in life, and freedom.\nThese are the things everyone is explicitly or implicitly interested in; it is through an analysis of a subject\u2019s relation to them that we can learn most about him or her.\nTherapists Are Descendants of Jesus and Buddha\nAccording to Irvin Yalom, therapists are privileged with hearing out the deepest and most intimate secrets of their subject; and they should act accordingly.\nHe writes:\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Gift of Therapy Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nis not Irvin Yalom\u2019s best book \u2013 if you want to read that one, look for \n \u2013 but it may be the one which will endure the longest.\nAbsorbing and wise, this one is also self-help styled, so it\u2019s more accessible than other books by Yalom.Yalom is right: \nis perfect as a supplement to a comprehensive psychotherapy training program.\n\n"},

so, around 2:00 PM, Nick takes a loose razor blade and slashes his left wrist; then he slashes his right.\nEven though he feels faint and nauseous and is bleeding profusely, he is not sure that he has done enough damage; bleeding across the basement floor, he finds a power cord, ties it into a noose and hangs himself.\nEven that is not enough: a few moments later, his wife finds him unconscious, bleeding, and hanging by the power cord, and calls 911.\nThey arrive too late: at around 2:30 PM, a DC coroner pronounces the 37-year-old Nick Marsh dead from asphyxiation.\nSix weeks earlier, on August 9, 2010, former Senator Ted Stevens boards \u201ca single-engine amphibious de Havilland DHC-3 Otter airplane for a day of Alaska\u2019s finest fishing.\u201d\nUnfortunately, the plane never arrives at its final location: it crashes into a slope of a heavily forested mountainside.\nOut of the nine people on board, five die, and four \u2013 including former NASA Chief Sean O\u2019Keefe and his son Kevin \u2013 survive.\nUnfortunately, Ted Stevens is not among the latter.\nTo anyone who watches the news from time to time and is older than 20, Ted Stevens is much more than just another name.\nBecause the breaking news that fateful evening of August 9 back in 2010 ran something like this over every single channel in the entire country:\nFORMER SENATOR TED STEVENS, BELOVED CHAMPION OF ALASKA, HAS BEEN KILLED NEAR DILLINGHAM, ALASKA, IN THE CRASH OF A PRIVATE PLANE WHILE HE WAS ON A FISHING TRIP WITH LONGTIME FRIENDS\nHowever, during the two years preceding this accident, Ted Stevens was somewhat less than beloved \u2013 even in his very own Alaska where he was considered all but a legend for most of his life.\nOne of the longest-serving U.S. Senator in history, Stevens was found guilty of all seven counts of making false statements (failing to report gifts properly) on October 27, 2008.\nJust eight days later, Stevens was defeated by Mark Begich for the Senate seat by no more than 3,724 votes.\nHowever, just a few months later, an FBI agent by the name of Chad Joy suggested that FBI agents and prosecutors may have intentionally withheld and concealed evidence which could have resulted in a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict for Stevens.\nIt turned out that Joy was right: \u201cthe prosecutors from the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice had broken ethical rules,\u201d reminds us Powell, \u201cdisregarded court orders, and violated constitutional law while they hid evidence favorable to his defense\u2014called \u2018Brady material.\u2019\u201d\nTed Stevens\u2019 death renewed interest in both fabricating evidence and the prosecutorial and government misconduct during his trial.\nAnd where\u2019s Nick Marsh in the story?\nYou\u2019ve guessed it alright:\nHe was one of the prosecutors in the elite Public Integrity Section of the Criminal Division of the US Department of Justice.\nThe Enron Debacle and the Arthur Andersen Conviction\nHold your horses: \nis not a book about Ted Stevens or Nick Marsh, and despite the thriller-like beginning, it is both much profound and, thus, inevitably more boring than \n.\nHowever, much like \n, it is about a pattern of injustice and government misconduct which may have cost the lives and the sanity of thousands and thousands of people.\nIn fact, after the first chapter, \ndelves deep into a long 200-page analysis of the Enron disaster of the 1990s, and particularly the prosecution of one Jim Brown of Merrill Lynch.\nWhy?\nWell, because Powell was tasked with representing Brown in his post-trial defense.\nBy now, you certainly know a lot about \n.\nAmerica\u2019s Most Innovative Company for six consecutive years, Enron was a giant in the energy business, employing over 30,000 people and claiming revenues of over $100 billion during 2000, the last year of its existence.\nSo, what happened?\nThe Enron scandal did, during which it was discovered that Enron\u2019s financial condition didn\u2019t really align with the actual facts.\nAnd you know that this is a subtle euphemism for fraud; systematic, creative and institutionalized fraud.\nHowever, asks Sidney Powell, do you know that almost every Enron-related conviction which has gone up on appeal has resulted in a complete or partial reversal?\nWait\u2026 \n?\n!\nTake Arthur Andersen, for example.\nThe only American company in the \u201cBig Five\u201d accounting firms \u2013 along with Netherlands-based KPMG and the British giants Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Ernst & Young) \u2013 back in 2001, Arthur Andersen was one of the world\u2019s largest multinational companies.\nUnfortunately, it was also the firm in charge of the Enron audit.\nThe result?\nOn June 15, 2002, Andersen was convicted of obstruction of justice: Nancy Temple (from Andersen\u2019s legal department) and David Duncan (lead partner for the Enron account) had apparently ordered the shredding of Enron-related documents.\nDespite employing close to 85,000 people, since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission doesn\u2019t accept audits from convicted felons, the company had to be closed soon afterward.\nAnd then, three years later in the case of \n, the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously reversed the conviction due to serious errors in the trial judge\u2019s jury instructions.\nApparently, hungry for a conviction, the prosecutors had pieced together parts of different statutes to fabricate a crime and purged criminal intent from the jury instructions.\nWhat about all those jobs, you ask?\nWell, that\u2019s what Powell is interested in as well.\nBecause while representing Jim Brown of Merrill Lynch, Powell had to deal with the very same pattern.\nAnd it all started with a relatively small business transaction between the two conglomerates at year-end 1999: Merrill Lynch entered into a \u201cbest efforts\u201d agreement with Enron over some Nigerian barges.\nBetter put, \u201cEnron solicited \u2013 indeed pushed and cajoled \u2013 Merrill Lynch to invest $7 million cash to purchase a minority equity interest in a company that would profit from three electrical power barges stationed off the coast of Nigeria.\u201d\nNow, Enron held the majority interest and controlled the barge project. Supposedly, it had sent the barges to the Nigerian coast \u201cto help the war-torn country with emergency electrical power\u201d at the request from the US State Department.\nOn December 23, 1999, there was \u201ca five-minute telephone conversation between Andrew Fastow (Enron\u2019s chief financial officer), Jeff McMahon (Enron\u2019s treasurer), Daniel Bayly of Merrill Lynch, and several others \u2013 but not Jim Brown.\u201d\nDuring this conversation, Fastow ensured McMahon that it \u201cwould use its best efforts and continue the process it had already started to remarket Merrill\u2019s interest in the barges to another party within six months.\u201d \u00a0\nThis was great, since, as Bayly made clear to Fastow, Merrill did not want to hold its equity in these barges very long.\nThe prosecutors, however \u2013 Andrew Weissman, Kathryn Ruemmler, Matthew Friedrich, and John Hemann \u2013 saw something much deeper and more sinister beneath this agreement.\nAccording to them:\nFor Weissman, Ruemmler, Friedrich & Hemann \u201cit didn\u2019t matter that none of the Merrill defendants personally profited from this transaction. It didn\u2019t matter that none engaged in any conduct that they thought was unlawful.\u201d And it didn\u2019t even matter that some people such as Jim Brown were not present during the phone call.\nSimply put, all it mattered to them was that there was some kind of a conspiracy based on nothing more but a possible (and never proven) \u201csecret oral side deal that Enron guaranteed to buy back the barges.\u201d\nThis negated even the fact that the Merrill Lynch corporate counsel had approved the transaction: the prosecutors claimed that the Merrill executives had lied to their own lawyers and kept them in the dark about the real deal, the one not in writing. \nEpilogue\nDo you even have to ask?\nWe started with a suicide and a lost election; we end, retroactively with hundreds of thousands of people left jobless, and the lives of quite a few innocent people irretrievably ruined.\nAnd what about the prosecutors?\nWell, you already know everything about two of them.\nKathryn Ruemmler, for example, who \u201cplainly suppressed\u201d evidence favorable to the defense in the Barge case became a partner at Latham & Watkins, then Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General at the Justice Department, and finally, White House counsel between 2011 and 2014.\nAndrew Weissman fared, arguably, even better: after destroying Arthur Andersen and Merrill Lynch, Weissman became deputy director/general counsel of the FBI; in late 2013 he \u201cquietly slipped from FBI to NYU,\u201d and in June 2017, he was appointed as a member of the 2017 special counsel team headed by Robert Mueller.\nAnd Sidney Powell?\n \u201cAs for me,\u201d she writes:\nDear Sidney, after your book, we are as well.\nKey Lessons from \u201cLicensed to Lie\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prosecutors Don\u2019t Care About Justice: They Care About Their Careers\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe Best Lack All Conviction, While the Worst Are Full of Passionate Intensity\u201d\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026and Justice for All\nProsecutors Don\u2019t Care About Justice: They Care About Their Careers\nAs evidenced in many cases surveyed in Sidney Powell\u2019s \n\u2013 the Enron scandal, the Andersen and Merrill Lynch convictions, the Ted Stevens debacle \u2013 prosecutors are often willingly and consciously hiding evidence in an attempt to win a case.\n\u201cMuch more must be required,\u201d writes Powell in the last paragraph of her book, \u201cof those who have the honor, privilege, and responsibility of representing us in our courts. They hold in their hands the very lives of our citizens while they are entrusted with and wield the fearsome might and unbridled power of the Sovereign to seek Justice or deal egregious Injustice.\u201d\n\u201cThe Best Lack All Conviction, While the Worst Are Full of Passionate Intensity\u201d\nUnfortunately, prosecutors hiding evidence often end up being on the winning side: not just of a certain case, but of life as well.\nKathryn Ruemmler, for example, and Andrew Weissman, who destroyed companies and cost the jobs of hundreds of thousands of people by \u201cplainly suppressing\u201d evidence made it to the White House. \nSidney Powell is furious:\nBrady Disclosure\u2026 and Justice for All\nAs can be seen from these cases, even the rich are not safe from obstructions of justice \u2013 a dish best served to the poor and unguarded. \nWhy?\nBecause if prosecutors want to achieve something, they have means to achieve it, and they usually don\u2019t care how ethical or unethical these means are.\nDon\u2019t know if you know \u2013 we didn\u2019t \u2013 but prosecutors have discretion with regard to the evidence they are obliged to provide to the defendants, i.e., they are the ones who decide which evidence is relevant to a defendant.\nThis, in effect, means that they are preparing his or her defense \u2013 which is not only unjust but also downright senseless.\n! \nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cLicensed to Lie Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nWe are not lawyers or that much interested in legal dramas but \nreally held our attention from beginning to end.\nThe book \u201creads like a cross between investigative journalism and courtroom drama\u201d (William Hodes) and it unearths the unethical behavior of numerous prosecutors \u2013 be they Republican or Democrat \u2013 harbored within the Department of Justice.\nWe applaud Powell for her courage and demand others to follow her lead and take a stand.\nHighly recommended."},

And Why?\nWell, it would be totally imprudent to categorize this book, as we believe that it is suited for everyone.\nYou will be surprised by Nick\u2019s determination and eagerness to defeat the odds and rise to the occasion despite what everyone else was saying.\nWe fully encourage you to take the time off, and have a glimpse into \u201c\n.\u201d\nAbout Nick Vujicic\nTruthfully, there are no words to describe \n and his life-endeavors\u2026\nOn a personal note: He is one of the most inspiring and influential people currently on this planet. It\u2019s not about what he\u2019s doing, but how and why.\nA shy boy, who turned into a sensation for millions of people across the globe.\nBorn without limbs, but with a pure heart that follows God.\n\u201cLife Without Limits PDF Summary\u201d\nYou can\u2019t just wait for a miracle to fall out of a clear blue sky, you got to get up and become one! Nick is regularly asked multiple questions along the lines of: \n?\nPeople fail to realize that despite his physical limitations, Nick has been living the life of his dreams, no excuses, no mantras, no sorry, only cheerfulness. In his words, happiness can only be reached when you accept the imperfect version of yourself.\nFor those of you that don\u2019t know, Nick Vujicic was born without limbs but has decided to embrace life as it is.\nAs we continue down this path, it\u2019s crucial to give a second thought to your \u201csupposed\u201d limitations.\nGod has created us under the notion of free choice, which means you are entitled to choose whatever life you so desire.\nIf dejection is what you settle upon then, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get.\nHowever sad and shallow life may seem at a given point, there\u2019s always this one thing called \u2013 hope, lurking beneath the surface.\nTo illustrate the real meaning of life, Nick Vujicic shared his parents\u2019 birth-experience with their first child \u2013 him.\nDuring the pregnancy, Nick\u2019s mom was told that everything is going smooth and there\u2019s no reason to be worried about anything.\nBut then all of a sudden, dead silence came to pass as the doctors laid eyes upon the baby.\nDushka Vujicic, being a nurse herself, knew that something is wrong when they escorted Nick\u2019s dad out of the room.\nLater on, they told them that their son was born with Phocomelia.\nIt was a big shock, and everyone started crying, including the nurses. His parents were not keen to lay out how it all turned out at the day of his birth but waited until Nick is old enough to be able to take it.\nOn his journeys, Nick often emphasizes the value of focusing on something you have, rather than on the things you don\u2019t have at arm\u2019s length.\nWhen we want to \n, more suffering is what we usually come across.\nA great paradox of human existence is that Nick\u2019s parents worried that he was going to grow up without a future, and life will be too hard for him.\nThey even considered adoption but decided to raise him as best they could.\nAs a young infant, Nick was blessed for not knowing his state and the challenges that are yet to be revealed.\nNick would perform some crazy stunts including hauling himself into an upward position, which left his parents speechless.\nRaising a child is by no means a picnic, but Nick always seemed to be eager to find a way on his own.\nNo doubt, life can sometimes seem like a mess but then again; try not to judge yourself too quickly if things don\u2019t turn out as planned.\nRemember, life is a marathon not a 100 meters sprint.\nAs you move along with the flow, your existence will start to reveal itself, like a butterfly ready to engage with the world.\nRight about the time, Nick was fifteen years of age; he had felt this push towards God and asked for forgiveness. \nOne time, Nick was preparing to give a speech at Knott\n in Anaheim, pretty close to his house.\nThe next moment, an older gentleman started shouting \u201cNick, Nick\u201d to get his attention.\nHe pointed to a man sitting next to him that had a child. That man stood up, lifted the child above the crowd so that Nick could see him.\nThe boy also didn\u2019t have any limbs. Upon laying eyes on him, Nick knew exactly what his parents are going through, and felt sorry for the boy\u2019s \u201climitations\u201d that will only amplify as it grows older.\nLife without meaning is nothing and a complete waste of time.\nPerhaps, if I can help this boy out a bit, then maybe he could overcome some of the challenges that I couldn\u2019t in my early years \u2013 Nick thought to himself.\nHis parents might look for someone to share their burden with, and by burden, Nick means not the child, but the cruelties of today.\nNick knew that God was testing him; he knew that the boy brought to him was a sign of mercy, love, and faith.\nTime and time again, Nick emphasizes the importance of the spirit, and how nothing can break it unless you allow it.\nHope appears with almost every breath, and this temporary life should not be taken for granted, to say the least.\nNick reckons that hope is tied to eternity and should be regarded as a test one must undergo in order to see the Godly grace.\nGod or this Universal force knows how much our hearts can bear, without exception; what sort of challenges should be put in front of them and why.\nOne of the best things you can do to ease off the burden is to talk to someone.\nNick admits that he doesn\u2019t have all the answers, but when the lights go out, and darkness emerges, the pathway to salvation is harder to find. By nurturing a close relationship with the people you love and cherish, you can find compassion even in the most inhospitable environments.\nIn 2008, Nick embarked on an adventure to China and went to marvel at the beauties of this ancient country.\nLater on, he saw a young Chinese girl whose eyes sprinkled with joy.\nNick found out that this girl, along with four thousand others were struck by an earthquake that decimated an entire region and left them homeless.\nHe was asked to speak in front of the kids of the orphanage, but he didn\u2019t know how to raise their spirits. His team already packed up some stuff for them including blankets and clothing that will keep them warm during the winter.\nUpon arriving at the orphanage, Nick was the one left speechless. One kid after another approached him, and hugged him, not saying a word.\nA mind-boggling moment for him, indeed!\n (Full Assurance in the Heart) is difficult to grasp, especially to people who don\u2019t believe in anything without seeing it. Living without faith and hope, as the Bible puts, loses its substance and meaning.\nSometimes by putting trust in something that is far beyond your level of understanding, you can achieve peace and comfort knowing that someone is watching out for you. \nAlso, Nick doesn\u2019t quite restrict the notion of \n, as he also endorses all other forms of establishing a spiritual bond. \nIt goes without saying that FAITH must be tested before that person receives a shower of blessings.\nNick in this autobiographical spin of life, also reveals that when he was around the age of ten, he suffered from depression.\nConstantly nagging yourself with thoughts of failure is merely the end result of focusing on the things you don\u2019t have.\nNick puts it delicately \u2013 \n.\nDuring a speaking event in Singapore, a distinguished gentleman approached Nick and asked for help. The man was what we usually call successful in the material sense, but had this gap in his personal life. He told Nick that his daughter who is 14 years old, feels intense dislike and hatred for her body and appearance.\nNick understood this man\u2019s pain because there\u2019s nothing more painful than seeing your child suffer.\nGod tells us that we are all wonderful and uniquely made. But sometimes, we find it hard to love ourselves for some vague and invalid reasons. Insecurities during this teenage period could induce lower self-esteem in advancing years, which could also lead to depression.\nWhen you fall prey to \u201cI am not good enough\u201d mentality, you are both right and wrong.\nSo, Nick did a little test.\nWhile addressing the crowd, he asked: \n?\nAlmost all of them raised their hands, but when he asked: \n?\nThen, they realized how we all are judgemental to some degree, more or less. Don\u2019t get it the wrong way; you are not required to seek love and acceptance from others but redirect that effort in building a strong inner bond with yourself.\nMost of the time, we bury our beauty so deep within us, that any form of lightness that might announce itself is immediately stifled.\nThrough our own actions and mindset, we amplify even the less significant problems and make a big deal out of everything.\nAs imperfection kicks in, some of us can\u2019t seem to cope with the idea of not having high stature in society.\nIndividuality is lost, faith is nowhere to be found, and the one thing we have left is dismay.\nIn all probability, even those people who appear perfect on the outside, have their flaws, shortcomings, and challenges. \nSo many fearful and insecure people place emphasis on \n rather than on \n? \nWhen we take a critical look at Nick Vujicic\u2019s life, we\u2019ll notice that God has endowed him with the courage to turn struggles into life-lessons!\nKey Lessons from \u201cLife Without Limits\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Faith is what will get you through\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What God desires might not be what you seek\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Make the first step\nFaith is what will get you through\nLife is not milk and honey, and sometimes you have to count on the abstract to get the ball rolling.

I want to lead Mars.\u201d\nThe second story of \n introduces us to a less extravagant and more rounded character, probably the most subtle one in the whole book.\nHis name?\nMoin Khan.\nBorn into a poor family \u2013 its income came from their two cows, and Moin spent most of his childhood delivering milk from one doorstep to another \u2013 Khan was hardly a man one could call educated even in his teenage years.\nAfter all, unlike Vinay Singhal, he didn\u2019t even have the chance to study, i.e., he was \u201cnot in a position to waste precious daylight in a classroom.\u201d\nSo, he didn\u2019t: he enrolled in a local college where he had to show up once a year: for the annual exam.\nBut then, after he grew tired of selling things (\u201cfirewood, toys, anything\u201d), Khan developed an interest in getting a respectable job and some money.\nAnd there was only one he could land without taking an entrance examination: at a call center, \u201cthe ultimate cheat\u2019s guide to the white-collar world\u201d for many Indians.\nIn case you didn\u2019t know \u2013 but you do \u2013 India houses more than half of the world\u2019s call center market. \nAlready by 2006, \u201cwhen Moin Khan heard his first-ever burst of spoken English by making a customer service call on a borrowed cell phone,\u201d over 2 million Indians were employed in the call center industry.\nMoin Khan\u2019s opportunity was a direct product of the market needs: he belongs to the first generation of non-English speakers trained to speak English as if they knew the language.\nA decade later, Khan is a teacher of Spoken English at the American Academy.\nNow at 27, he prepares other young men to follow in his footsteps; they all believe that, even though legacy of an \n, English is their way out of poverty and disrespect.\nThe third guy we meet in Snigdha Poonam\u2019s \nis Pankaj Prasad, a sort of a middleman between the \u201cintimidating,\u201d \u201cinscrutable,\u201d and \u201cinaccessible\u201d government (\n) and the ordinary people of India.\n\u201cThe gap between the regular Indian and Sarkar is widest at the very bottom,\u201d writes Poonam, \u201cwhere the government deals with the people least aware of what they are owed\u2026 The execution of welfare policies is\u2026 tedious; it requires a mastery of paperwork and the energy to run between government departments. Most ordinary people leave it to a fixer.\u201d\nWell, Pankaj Prasad is exactly that: a fixer, or \u201cpyraveekar\u201d in Urdu, the link between the poorest and the administration, someone who\u2019s undeniably corrupt but essential as well.\n\u201cRural fixers,\u201d say Poonam, \u201chave been around in India for as long as anyone has tried to govern the lives of villagers. It is, in fact, one of the most lucrative career options available in an Indian village.\u201d\nSo, what\u2019s the difference between the Generation Y youngsters and the \n of yore?\nWell, unlike their predecessors, Prasad and those like him know that the government needs them more than they need the government.\nThat\u2019s why, Prasad:\nPart II: \u2018I Am Ready for a Fight\u2019\nLet\u2019s face it: as it stands, India is not a success story; if it had been, it would have been a superpower, the third one in addition to USA and China, if not the one even these two countries look up to. \nHowever, India is still a country where for every success story such as the three in Part I, there\u2019s a frustrated one, such as these in Part II, and an unsuccessful one \u2013 such as the two in Part III.\nIn \u201cThe Angry Young Men,\u201d Poonam introduces us to a range of Hindu nationalists and Hindutva extremists, poetically referred to as saffron terrorists by many newspaper outlets.\nHowever, there\u2019s absolutely nothing poetic about the things they are interested in: whether they are members of the Cow Protection Army or merely self-proclaimed saviors, these men think they have figured out the right way for a human being to live his/her life and are interested into demonstrating this to anyone who has wandered off.\nThe \n\u2013 aka, the Cow Protection soldiers \u2013 are \u201cthe most feared men in India\u201d right now; they live out Hollywood movies driving cars with guns in their hands, and waging a holy war against the murderers of holy animals.\nTheir logo?\nThe gilded torso of a cow bordered by AK-47s and a pair of swords.\nEver since the election of Narendra Modi\u2019s BJP in 2014, there has been a severe rise in cow-protection violence in India; in fact, just during the last few years, at least 30 people have been lynched (most of them Muslims) and around 125 have been injured by \n.\nArjun Kumar is not one of them, but that doesn\u2019t stop him from thinking that he\u2019s here on Earth to introduce some holy order in the grand scheme of things.\nA member of the militant Bajrang Dal, he is one of many young Hinduists roaming India who hates unmarried couples so much that he spends Valentine\u2019s Day chasing them with an iron rod: \nSometimes, it gets even worse: activists of Bajrang Dal have been known to force unmarried couples to tie rakhis or apply sindors against their will, thus, essentially forcing them to marry.\nNotice the singular in the title: there are many angry young men in the previous chapter, but Snigdha Poonam has opted for a single angry young woman here.\nHer name is Richa Singh, the only heroine of \n.\nHer achievement?\nBecoming a president of the Allahabad University Students\u2019 Union.\nWell, that\u2019s not really something, you\u2019d think!\nHowever, as Poonam states, this is \u201cone of the most important elections in Uttar Pradesh,\u201d comparable to \u201cthe one to the assembly in Lucknow or to the Parliament in Delhi.\u201d\n\u201cThe election to the students\u2019 union of Allahabad University,\u201d Poonam goes on, \u201cdoesn\u2019t just decide which student party gets to call the shots in the campus \u2013 and by extension the city \u2013 but is also known as the most reliable indicator of wider political currents.\u201d\nBut even then \u2013 it seems as if nothing special.\nAnd yet it is: never, in the history of Allahabad University, has a woman been elected to the Students\u2019 Union, let alone becoming its president.\nWhy?\nWell, read the previous chapter yet again: guys like Arjun Kumar (or the unmentioned Vikas Thakur or Sachin Ahuja) have a vision of what a lady is supposed to do and look like, and, these are not \nHowever, Richa Singh decided to take on the upper-caste Hindutva extremists and the patriarchy of the University \u2013 and won.\nAnd as the president, she resisted the ABVP and two years before he became the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Singh managed to stop Yogi Adityanath from entering the campus of Allahabad University.\n.\nYou go, girl!\nPart III: \u2018Nothing Is What It Looks Like\u2019\nSometimes things are not as great as they seem at first sight: the last part of Poonam\u2019s book tells two stories which reveal the dark interior beneath the shiny surface. \nIn \u201cThe Star,\u201d Poonam introduces us to Azhar Khan \u2013 but not the one you know as \nNope: this Azhar Khan still dreams of becoming someone as famous as the first one. \nAnd at the age of 21, after winning the first \u201cMr. Jharkhand\u201d pageant, it must have seemed to Azhar that his dreams are not unrealistic: if not a Hollywood darling, he was destined to become a Bollywood star.\nLike his role model John Abraham, Azhar Khan planned to start with modeling and use this as a springboard to a film career. \nAnd for a while, he was the king of the world: he won a prize, took part in a few modelling sessions, and was wanted by some important people; he even had a beautiful girlfriend for a week or two.\nBut then everything went downhill.\nAfter learning that he had won a prize (the inevitable price of being famous, ha?), some people started asking him to pay out his debt to them, which Khan had amassed because of a few failed business ventures (selling shirts and running a fast-food restaurant) from the time before he became a local TV star.\nTo make matters worse, suddenly his brother lost his job, so Azhar was stuck with working to pay off this debt; eventually, he had to apply for a loan so that he could set up an enterprise to earn the necessary money.\nIn the end, Azhar Khan had no option but to run away to Mumbai and find support there from his now-few Facebook followers.\n\u201cThe Scammer\u201d is Snigdha Poonam at her investigative best: to understand what\u2019s happening on the other side of India\u2019s booming call center industry, she went undercover as a job aspirant, interviewing four times for a single job without even knowing what she would be selling if she ever got in.\nAnd the things she found out?\nAs widely suspected and even more widely known, some of these call centers weren\u2019t call centers at all, but double-dealing and extortion schemes committing various kinds of fraud against na\u00efve American citizens. \nThe worst kind of way to earn money.\nBut, in the India of today, sometimes it\u2019s either that or absolute poverty.\nEpilogue\nIn the \u201cEpilogue,\u201d Snigdha Poonam informs us where the people mentioned in the seven chapters of her book are now and what this means in relation to India\u2019s present and its future.\nAnd, in a way, we realize that she has already written out the conclusion of \nin the first chapter of the book:\nKey Lessons from \u201cDreamers\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0India\u2019s Generation Y, the Biggest Generation in History\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 3E Problems: India and Its Young People\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Future of the World Depends on the Young Indians of Today\nIndia\u2019s Generation Y, the Biggest Generation in History\nOver half of India\u2019s population is under the age of 25.\nMeaning: there are 600 million young Indians treading the Earth in this very moment, making India\u2019s Generation Y the biggest generation in all of human history.\nAnd they are either destined for greatness or utter failure.\nThe 3E Problems: India and Its Young People\nIndia\u2019s Generation Y has been dubbed \u201cscarred generation\u201d by the International Labor Organization. \nThe reasons?\nDue to India\u2019s economic problems, about 87% of the young Indians are either uneducated, unemployed, or unemployable.\nFor comparison, in Japan and South Korea it is the other way around: no more than one-fifth of Japan\u2019s population and merely 4% of South Korea\u2019s workforce \nhighly skilled.\nThe Future of the World Depends on the Young Indians of Today\nEven though it is \u201ca pipe dream at this point,\u201d Snigdha Poonam believes that \u201cthe world\u2019s future depends on young Indians meeting their aspirations.\u201d\nThe sheer number of them reveals the magnitude of their potential.\nHowever, that very number is the problem: in the next decade, India will need to build 1000 universities and at least 50,000 colleges to educate about 100 million people.\nAnd that\u2019s something that\u2019s never been done.\nThe result?\nUnfortunately, as an \n review states, \u201cIf young Indians really are changing the world, it may not be for the better.\u201d\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cDreamers Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\n\u201cDiligently reported and crisply written,\u201d writes Pankaj Mishra, the author of \n\u201c\n is an eye-opening guide to India\u2019s troubling present \u2013 and future.

And Why?\nThe blurb says that \nshould be \u201cperfect for fans of Tina Turner\u2019s \n and Sally Field\u2019s \n\u201d\nWe\u2019ll go even further: it should prove to be a great read for anyone who dreamt of becoming \u2013 or \n \u2013 a Sandy in her/his own life after the 1978 smash-hit \n, and, well, for any music lover out there. \nAfter all, Olivia Newton-John is one of the best-selling artists of all time and has sold more records than, say, the aforementioned Turner, The Who, Stevie Wonder or David Bowie.\nNaturally, don\u2019t dare to miss this memoir if you\u2019re Australian. Because, let\u2019s face it, ONJ is nothing short of a national treasure.\nAbout Olivia Newton-John\n is an English-Australian singer, actress, and activist.\nA four-time Grammy Award winner, Newton-John has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling artists of all time. \nEleven of her singles have been certified gold, two of which have been certified platinum as well; in addition, fourteen of her albums has received a gold certification: two of them have been certified platinum and another four double platinum.\nEven so, Newton-John is probably most known as the protagonist in the musical \n, the soundtrack of which is one of the most successful soundtracks in history; in addition, the single (sung with John Travolta) \u201cYou\u2019re the One That I Want\u201d is the 14\n best-selling single ever.\n\u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019 PDF Summary\u201d\nHeartwarming and engaging, humorous and candid, \nreveals Olivia Newton-John\u2019s life story \u2013 as the blurb says \u2013 \u201cfrom her unforgettable rise to fame in the classic musical \n to her passionate advocacy for health and wellness in light of her battles with cancer.\u201d\nConsequently, basically any biography of Newton-John \u2013 say, \n \u2013 is a sort of a summary of this book; it would be pointless if just run through the most important parts of her life as well because then we\u2019ll probably sound just too factual and too boring.\nAnd \nis anything but!\nThat\u2019s why we opted for a different strategy, and, in continuation, we share with you the most interesting bits and pieces of Olivia Newton-John\u2019s biography, taken from the early parts of her life, when she was not that famous.\nOf course, if you\u2019re interested in finding out more \u2013 you can buy the book! Or write to us to update the summary with the second half of her life.\nHope you\u2019ll enjoy this one!\nThat\u2019s Quite an Interesting Family You\u2019ve Got There, ONJ!\nWhen Olivia Newton-John sums up a brief stroll through her family history with the stereotypical \u201cA lot to live up to!\u201d you certainly wouldn\u2019t expect that to be an understatement.\nBut, believe us, it more than \n!\nLet\u2019s start with Newton-John\u2019s father Brinley \u201cBryn\u201d Newton-John (1914\u20131992) who was a talented singer with a beautiful bass-baritone voice, and a Headmaster at Cambridgeshire High School for Boys when Olivia was born. \nNothing special?\nWell, to use Olivia\u2019s words, he was also a \u201cbig force of nature and former MI5 agent.\u201d Even more, he was on the Enigma project and was one of the guys who took Rudolf Hess into custody. \n Rudolf Hess of \u201cAdolf Hitler\u2019s Deputy F\u00fchrer Rudolf Hess.\u201d\nBut that\u2019s nothing compared to Olivia Newton-John\u2019s remarkable family on her mother\u2019s side.\nTo start with, Newton-John\u2019s mother, Irene Helene, was a translator of a book of letters exchanged between Albert Einstein and Max Born, titled, simply, \n.\nMax Born, in case you didn\u2019t know, was a German-Jewish physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1954. \nWhy is he important to be mentioned here in a separate sentence?\nWell, in addition to being one of the greatest physicists of the last century, a friend of Einstein, and a dedicated celebrator of peace, Born was also Irene Helene\u2019s father and, thus, Olivia Newton-John\u2019s maternal grandfather! \nNow, Max Born was married to the daughter of the famous German jurist Victor Ehrenberg whose wife\u2019s father was the founder of the historical school of law, Rudolf von Jhering.\nGo even further back, and you\u2019ll reach none other than Martin Luther, the guy who basically invented modern religion for most of the Western world!\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s a Spanish king in there somewhere, too,\u201d adds Newton-John.\nA lot to live up to, indeed!\nOlivia Newton-John Walked In Once on John Lennon and Yoko Ono\nIf you know at least something about Olivia Newton-John, then you probably know Bruce Welch.\nBest known as a member of The Shadows, Bruce Welch often acted as Cliff Richard\u2019s producer and wrote several of his and Olivia Newton-John\u2019s hits.\nHe was also a fianc\u00e9e of Newton-John for a while, and one of the co-producers of her first album, \n.\nThe other, in case you\u2019re interested, was Newton-John\u2019s long-time musical partner (and soon a member of The Shadows), John Farrar, who had just married Olivia\u2019s singing partner from her Australian days, Pat Campbell.\nAnyway, it was 1971, and \nwas recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. A frequent guest at the recordings was Newton-John\u2019s dog Geordie who knocked the mic stand during the guitar solo in the title song. \nAnd you know what? If you listen carefully, you can hear it on the final recording!\nEven more interestingly, in the very next studio while Newton-John was recording her first album, George Martin was recording The Beatles\u2019 last album.\nBruce was friends with them, so Newton-John got to meet them all. \nAnd how close was Bruce to them?\nWell, let\u2019s just say that a few years before, Paul McCartney offered him a song. Bruce wanted to hear it first, and Paul played a few bars of the song to Bruce, who eventually turned it down.\n\u201cIt had a different working title then,\u201d says Newton-John, \u201cbut it was \u2018Yesterday\u2019!\u201d\nOh, yeah, about the title of the section.\n\u201cOne day,\u201d informs us candidly Newton-John, \u201cI walked in and found John and Yoko sitting around with their arms and legs entwined, young and in love. It\u2019s a beautiful memory.\u201d\nIf you say so, ONJ! Knowing them, we are not even sure if they were fully clothed.\nHow to Attract the Attention of a Young Olivia Newton-John\n\u201cIt was exciting to have an album out and the next months went by in a blur of getting-to-know-you promotional appearances on television shows across Europe, the UK, and Australia, along with a stage tour,\u201d writes Newton-John.\n\u201cPerhaps I was too young to handle it all,\u201d she adds, \u201cbut I went down a path that I would later regret, which led to Bruce and me breaking off our engagement.\u201d\nAfter their breakup, Olivia went to the South of France on holiday with her friend (and then London roommate) Chantal from Australia. \nChantal invited Olivia to meet her fianc\u00e9\u2019s cousin, a certain Lee Kramer. They had a lovely summer night out, during which, at one point, he leaned over to her and told her: \u201cYou sure look better at night than in the daytime.\u201d\n\u201cWell, he certainly had my attention!\u201d writes Olivia.\nAnyway, Newton-John was supposed to leave for London the next day, and, well, you know what they say, \u201cSummer fling don\u2019t mean a thing.\u201d\nLee Kramer thought otherwise, though.\nLet\u2019s rephrase that: you know who was sitting next to her on her flight back? \nHe would tell her many years later that he paid a lot of money for that seat. \nBut he did get Newton-John in return: they dated for a few years during which he was also her manager.\nEurovision Coincidences\nAnd during this year another interesting thing happened: Newton-John, then just 26 years old, was selected to represent the United Kingdom at the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest.\nOlivia sang a different song each week on \n, with the public voting for their favorite.\nThe public eventually chose the song \u201cLong Live Love\u201d and fared quite good at the contest.\nNow, the book says that she \u201ccame in third,\u201d but we \n and found out that, in fact, she shared the fourth place, behind Netherlands, Italy, and Sweden.\nYup, not that anyone had a chance to win that year: Sweden finished first because they sent ABBA and because ABBA sang \u201cWaterloo\u201d that year.\nNot that ONJ minded: \u201cI loved ABBA, and we became fast friends,\u201d notes she in her memoir.\nAnyway, even though her career was taking off, Newton-John\u2019s personal life was in shambles: she broke up with Lee, and got back together with Bruce for a short time; but that didn\u2019t work out either.\nInterestingly enough, Britain\u2019s representative at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1973 was Cliff Richard, and The Shadows (now with John Farrar) represented the UK one year later.\nWe don\u2019t know this for a fact, but we\u2019re quite sure that this has to be the only case in Eurovision\u2019s history when two ex-fianc\u00e9es and several (ex-)musical collaborators represented the same country in three consecutive years!\nStar Encounters\n\u201cOne of the interesting parts of fame is that you get to meet so many actors and musicians that you admire and look up to,\u201d writes Olivia Newton-John. \nHere are some of those early encounters.\nOnce, when Newton-John was on tour with Paul Williams, she traveled with him on a private jet to each gig. And remember, these are the pre-Sandy 2 days still, so Olivia Newton-John was the \u201chopelessly devoted\u201d nice girl everybody loved to love!\nWell, that nice girl got into the worst whipped cream fight at 35,000 feet in the air and made a gigantic mess inside the private jet.\n\u201cWho was on that plane?\u201d ONJ heard someone asking later on. \u201cLed Zeppelin.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d they were told. \u201cOlivia Newton-John!\u201d\nThey couldn\u2019t believe it.\nWhen she auditioned for \n, Newton-John got to spend a day with none other but Dustin Hoffmann.\n\u201cHe was really funny and suggested we just walk around one of the neighborhoods in Malibu,\u201d she writes. \u201cWe talked about movies and life, and finally found ourselves walking up a long driveway by mistake.

Daniel-Hyacinthe-Marie Li\u00e9nard de Beaujeu.\nWhy?\nBecause that is the day that one of the four main characters of \n, George Washington, then a volunteer in General Edward Braddock\u2019s army, redeems his honor after surrendering to the French at Fort Necessity the previous year and the day he ceases being a surveyor and Virginia gentleman to become a warrior.\nInterestingly enough, this happens in a defeat: Braddock is soundly defeated at the Battle of the Monongahela by a force of French and Canadian troops.\nCaptain Daniel Li\u00e9nard de Beaujeu dies, but dies a victorious hero.\n\u2019s Story\nSince it\u2019s both impossible and impractical to tell the story of \nas it is told by O\u2019Reilly and Dugard (jumping from a character to character from one to the next chapter), we\u2019ll summarize it neatly grouping the narrative arcs via the four main characters of the book.\nNo need to tell you that the characters in question are: George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and George III.\nAfter introducing us to the so-called Bradock\u2019s Disaster and George Washington\u2019s resignation from Britain\u2019s military service, Dugard and O\u2019Reilly jump two decades ahead (to June 16, 1775) and present the now 41-year-old Washington in a completely new light:\nNominated by Samuel and John Adams \u2013 to the utter joy of everyone present \u2013 Washington accepts this new title (Commander in Chief of the newly-formed Continental Army).\n\u201cAs to pay, Sir,\u201d he says in his acceptance speech, \u201cI beg leave to assure the Congress, that, as no pecuniary consideration could have tempted me to have accepted this arduous employment, at the expense of my domestic ease and happiness, I do not wish to make any profit from it.\u201d\nThe rest is (pretty known) history.\nAs the very first Commanding General of the United States Army, George Washington leads the Continental Army to many victories, most notably in the first battle fought after the Declaration of Independence and the largest one of the whole war (The Battle of Long Island), and, more importantly, the morale-boosting Surrender of Yorktown which prompts the British government to negotiate an end to the conflict.\nNo wonder Washington is still remembered as the \u201cfirst in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.\u201d\n is just too colorful to be retold in a few hundred words \u2013 or even a few hundred pages, for that matter.\nJustly considered \u201cThe First American\u201d in history, Franklin was a polymath who was capable of turning into gold basically everything he would touch.\nKnown for inventing the Franklin stove, bifocals, and (most notably) the lightning rod, Franklin was everything from a leading author to a publisher, from a still-quoted physicist to one of the foremost scientists of his time, from a smart politician to a Grand Master Freemason.\nAs far as America\u2019s efforts to kill England, for the most part of his life, he was impartial and pacifistic. \u201cIn England,\u201d he wrote describing the effects of this, \u201cI am accused of being too much an American, and in America of being too much an Englishman.\u201d\nO\u2019Reilly and Dugard follow Benjamin Franklin from his ambassadorship day to France through his change of mind in relation to the new country to his career as the first United States Postmaster General. \nHowever, O\u2019Reilly and Dugard don\u2019t shy away from portraying Ben Franklin\u2019s dark side as well, as well as his reputation as a sort of a ladies\u2019 men.\nThis, of course, means that Benjamin Franklin wasn\u2019t that great of a husband or a father, and \nuncovers quite a few interesting events related to this side of \u201cthe most accomplished American of his age.\u201d\nHere\u2019s an interesting bit (you probably already know): Benjamin Franklin\u2019s illegitimate son William fought for England because he hated his father more; in addition, he exiled himself after learning that Benjamin Franklin planned to arrest him.\nNeedless to add, the two never spoke again after this.\nUnderstandably and quite expectedly, Thomas Jefferson\u2019s narrative arc mostly focuses on him writing the Declaration of Independence.\nAs everybody knows, he was recommended to do that by John Adams, whose reasons to choose Jefferson before him were threefold:\n\u2022 First of all, unlike Adams who was from Braintree, Massachusetts, Jefferson was a Virginian, \u201cand a Virginian ought to appear at the head of this business;\u201d\n\u2022 Secondly, USA\u2019s third president was everything the country\u2019s second president was not, in Adams\u2019 words \n an \u201cobnoxious, suspected, and unpopular\u201d person;\n\u2022 And thirdly and more importantly, in Adams\u2019 words, Jefferson could write ten times better than him.\nIn retrospect, it seems that Adams was right on at least this last account: the Declaration of Independence is one of the pinnacles of elegant political writing, and its preamble is, by all accounts, one of the highlights in humanity\u2019s history:\n\u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d\nAbout that \u201call men are created equal\u201d part\u2026\nThomas Jefferson was a fairly rich slaveowner who most probably fathered six children with one of his slaves, a mixed-race woman named Sally Hemings, born four decades after USA\u2019s third president.\nWell, it seems that \n was right: some humans are created \n equal than others.\n surprises the most in its pretty neutral representation of King George III of the United Kingdom.\nGeorge was merely 22 years old when he was coronated in 1760, and ruled England during the most tumultuous times of its glory years as a colonial superpower.\nEngland was already in war with (mainly) France for global military and political primacy at the time of his coronation and, in 1763, after the Treaties of Paris and Hubertusburg, Britain\u2019s victory in the Seven Years\u2019 War was joyously celebrated on the American continent.\nHell, we\u2019ll go even further than that: George III was celebrated as a hero, and the future Americans reveled in the fact that they were citizens of the world\u2019s greatest and most powerful empire.\nHowever, Britain\u2019s victory came at a hefty price: according to George Grenville, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Britain\u2019s budget deficit in 1763 was in excess of \u00a3122 million.\nAnd America was just too big and attractive place to collect new taxes.\nOf course, the Americans (especially the three guys from the chapters above) didn\u2019t share this opinion with King George III (they believed they were British and, thus, have the same rights as the English) and that\u2019s how the American War for Independence broke out.\nEven though some historians accuse King George of fighting too long a lost war, O\u2019Reilly and Dugard are far more sympathetic: he was just doing what his position demanded him to do.\nAnd until the Siege of Yorktown, many still believed in a British victory.\nHowever, that didn\u2019t happen, and George accepted the defeat.\n\u201cI was the last to consent to the separation,\u201d he told John Adams in 1785, \u201cbut I would be the first to meet the friendship of the United States as an independent power.\u201d\nPostscript\nincludes a long postscript in which the later days of most of the characters mentioned in the book are related.\nThe final paragraph, as if a before-credits title card, reveals neutrally and chillingly the numbers and figures of the American War of Independence:\nKey Lessons from \u201cKilling England\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The American War of Independence Was Not Inevitable\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Benjamin Franklin\u2019s Son Fought Against His Father\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thomas Jefferson Fathered Six Children with His Wife\u2019s Half-Sister\nThe American War of Independence Was Not Inevitable\nEven though, in retrospect, one could argue that it was inevitable that it would happen sooner or later, it seems that Britain\u2019s bad tax strategy is to blame for the American Revolutionary War.\nNot only most of the Americans rejoiced after Britain won the Seven Years\u2019 War against France in 1763, but also some of the leaders of the American Revolution \u2013 such as, say, Benjamin Franklin \u2013 were firmly against independence not that long before the war broke out.\nBenjamin Franklin\u2019s Son Fought Against His Father\nIn matters public and intellectual, Benjamin Franklin was the foremost American of his time; however, as far as his personal life is concerned, he was quite the Casanova with the ladies and quite the Darth Vader with his illegitimate son William.\nWilliam hated him so much, in fact, that he fought \n America during the War for Independence and exiled himself after Benjamin wanted to arrest him for that.\nThomas Jefferson Fathered Six Children with His Wife\u2019s Half-Sister\nThomas Jefferson may have written the most famous line in American history \u2013 \u201call men are created equal\u201d \u2013 but he didn\u2019t practice it in his personal life.\nOn the contrary, he was a slave owner and, moreover, he fathered six children with one of his slaves, a mixed-race woman by the name of Sally Hemings.\nTo make matters even worse, Sally was basically a half-sister of Jefferson\u2019s first and only wife, Martha.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cKilling England Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nEven though \nsold the least number of copies when compared to the other books of the \nseries (65,000 in its initial week, less than half of \n and only a third of \n), it may be, in our opinion, one of the better books of the series.\nIt is not only enthralling and enjoyable: it is also finely researched and bereaved of prejudice;

And Why?\nis not merely the best book in Ray Bradbury\u2019s oeuvre, but one of the greatest works of the human imagination in English or any other language.\nIn other words, consider yourself a poor person if you have never read this book \u2013 and mend that mistake as quickly as possible.\nRay Bradbury Biography\n was an American writer, most famous for his SF, horror, and mystery novels and short stories.\nOne of the most celebrated American authors of the 20\n century, Bradbury is considered \u201cthe writer most responsible for bringing modern science fiction into the literary mainstream.\u201d\nIn addition to \n, Bradbury is also the author of \nand \n\u2013 all of them adapted in one way or another.\nFind out more at \n. \nPlot\n\u201cWhere books are burned,\u201d wrote German poet Heinrich Heine back in 1823,\u201d \u201cin the end, people will also be burned.\u201d\nMore than a century later, his prediction eerily came true in his very own country.\nAnd a few years after the Second World War, in the McCarthy era, American writer Ray Bradbury was deeply concerned that history might repeat itself in his very own country, the land of the free.\nSo as\nto find an esthetic outlet for this concern, Bradbury wrote\n, quite possibly the best book ever written on the subject of books and book burning.\nSet in an unspecified city \u2013 probably somewhere in the American Midwest \u2013 at the end of the second millennium (but written as if set in a fairly distant future), the book presents a future American society in which most books are outlawed and burned by specially trained \u201cfiremen.\u201d\nHence the title and the famous tagline of the book: \u201cFahrenheit 451 \u2013 the temperature at which book paper catches fire, and burns\u2026\u201d\nThe novel is divided into three parts: \u201cThe Hearth and the Salamander,\u201d \u201cThe Sieve and the Sand,\u201d and \u201cBurning Bright.\u201d\nLet\u2019s summarize them!\nPart I: The Hearth and the Salamander\n, the main protagonist of \n, is one of the \u201cfiremen\u201d mentioned above. However, unlike real firemen, he and his coworkers are tasked with starting, rather than putting out fires.\nEmployed by the state to burn the possessions of those who own and read outlawed books, Guy Montag is married to \n, a woman \u201cthin as a praying mantis from dieting, her hair burnt by chemicals to a brittle straw, and her flesh like white bacon.\u201d\nOne night, while returning from work, Guy meets his neighbor, \n, who is,\nin her own and her uncle\u2019s words, \u201cseventeen and insane.\u201d \nShe is also not that popular among her peers, because she\u2019s asking their teachers \u201cwhy\u201d instead of \u201chow\u201d and because she\u2019s just too open-minded and free-spirited for everyone\u2019s sake.\nAfter having a brief discussion with her, Montag returns to his house and finds Millie overdosed on sleeping pills.\nHe calls for medical help and, soon, two pretty insensitive and hard-hearted EMTs arrive at the house of the Montag\u2019s. \nThey pump Millie\u2019s stomach and drain her poisoned blood; it is the future, so they can replace it with new one; hence, in a way, they resurrect her.\nAfter the EMTs leave, the now somewhat calmed Montag goes outside and overhears a discussion between Clarisse and her family about the point of living in an illiterate, hedonistic society.\nFor the first time in his life, Montag starts to wonder about things, overwhelmed by Clarisse\u2019s whys and his wife\u2019s near-death experience.\nUnsurprisingly, Montag starts welcoming the conversations with Clarisse who faithfully meets him every night as he comes home from work. \nHowever, just as he starts enjoying them, Clarisse suddenly disappears.\nSoon after Clarisse\u2019s disappearance, Guy Montag and his colleagues are tasked with burning the books in possession of an old woman.\nThough they ransack the house, the old woman seems unbothered:\nThe woman chooses to burn herself together with her books to the utter amazement of Guy Montag, who steals one book at the last moment and manages to hide it under his pillow at home.\nStruggling to fall asleep, Montag asks Millie whether she has heard anything about Clarisse; she tells him that she has died four days ago, hit by a speeding car and that her family has subsequently moved away.\nGuy awakens the next morning, ill and confused.\nHowever, Millie seems more interested in the \u201cparlor wall\u201d entertainment in her living room (TV shows on flat-panel TVs) than in taking care of him.\nMontag suggests taking a break from his job, but Millie is not a great fan of the idea, because that might mean losing the house and her parlor walls. \nAfter some time, sensing that something\u2019s seriously wrong with Guy, his fire chief \narrives at his house to see how he\u2019s doing.\nObviously trained for occasions such as this, Captain Beatty gives Guy a famous speech covering the history of the world up to that point.\nAnd for the first time we understand how books lost their value and what is actually going on in Guy Montag\u2019s head:\nWith the advent of radio and television, Captain Beatty explains, \u201cthings began to have mass. . . and because they had mass, they became simpler . . . Once, books appealed to a few people, here, there, everywhere. They could afford to be different. The world was roomy. But then the world got full of eyes and elbows and mouths. Double, triple, quadruple population. Films and radios, magazines, books leveled down to a sort of paste pudding norm.\u201d\nOver the course of the following few decades, to accommodate short attention spans and due to many protests by minority groups over controversial and outdated content in the books, classics were \u201ccut to fit fifteen-minute radio shows, then cut again to fill a two-minute book column, winding up at last as a ten-or twelve-line dictionary resume.\u201d\nAt the same time, the advancements of technology made firemen redundant: all buildings were now built of fireproof materials, so firemen could now start, rather than put out fires.\nIn other words, the government tasked them with destroying books for society\u2019s sake, especially \u201cthe slippery stuff\u201d like literature, philosophy, sociology, you know, things which ask \u201cwhy\u201d instead of \u201chow.\u201d\nBeatty leaves the house of the Montags with a threat, and the first part ends with Guy forcing Millie to read with him so that the two can see if books have values or not.\nThe Sieve and the Sand\nThe second part begins where the first one ends: with Montag and Millie discussing books stolen by Guy during his book-burning missions.\nHowever, unlike Guy who is curious, Millie is completely uninterested in discussions such as these, questioning the very reason why should anyone ever care about books.\nIn a rant, Guy gives her quite a few: the world is empty and shallow, an old woman decided that it is not worth living without books, and, let us not forget, she has recently survived a suicide attempt.\nPerhaps, Guy thinks, perhaps these old books have some answers which can soothe us, and even pacify the threat of war which is both constant and ignored by just about everybody.\nThe conversation between Guy and Millie is interrupted by a call: it\u2019s \n, a friend of Millie, who wants to set up a date with her and their other friend, \n, to watch the \u201cparlor walls\u201d that night at the house of the Montags.\nGuy realizes that there\u2019s nothing he can do to arouse Millie\u2019s interest, so he tries to remember someone who could help him with his new-discovered dilemmas and thoughts.\nAnd, suddenly, he has a revelation: \n, an English professor from the time before books were banned, whom Guy has met once previously in a park.\nIf he can\u2019t help me, he thinks, nobody can.\nSo Guy takes an old and rare copy of the \n with himself and heads to Faber\u2019s house.\nOf course, Faber is not that interested into talking with a fireman, but Guy has his way with him in the end: he forces Faber to start speaking after threatening to rip every single page of the \nif he doesn\u2019t.\nHowever, during the discussion, Faber realizes that Montag is changed and he gives him an ear-piece communicator through which he promises to guide him on his journey.\nBack at his house, Guy Montag finds Millie with her friends immersed in their \u201cparlor wall\u201d shows. \nFrustrated and angry with their ignorance and indifference to the real world around them, Montag turns off the walls and tries starting a discussion with the three women on important and meaningful matters.\nThe discussion goes nowhere and the enraged and, thus, careless Montag (to the dismay of Mr. Faber who overhears everything through the earpiece) storms into his room and comes back with a book of poetry in his hands.\nGuy starts reciting Matthew Arnold\u2019s \u201cDover Beach\u201d to the women, and Mrs. Phelps starts to cry.\nMillie tries to dismiss everything describing it as a firemen\u2019s tradition, but her friends eventually leave in disgust, despite the fact that (at the behest of the voice of Faber), Guy burns the poetry book.\nAware of the fact that Captain Beatty knows more than he tells him \u2013 and suspicious that he has already seen a book at his place \u2013 Guy takes the stolen Bible and heads to the firehouse where Beatty is playing cards with other firemen.\nAs the book is thrown into the trash, Beatty reveals to Guy that he had dreamt him engaging in a quoting-war with him; apparently, the disillusioned antagonist Captain Beatty did read books in his time \u2013 and enjoyed them.\nSuddenly, a fire alarm sounds.\nBeatty hears through the dispatcher: the location of the fire is Montag\u2019s house.\nBurning Bright\nAfter revealing to Guy that his wife and her friends had reported the events of the previous night to the government, Beatty orders Montag to destroy his own house.\nMontag, seeing no way out, obliges, abolishing his house with a flamethrower provided by Beatty.\nMillie goes mad: not because of what\u2019s happening to her actual husband or her house, but because of the fact that she\u2019s losing her \u201cparlor wall\u201d family, i.e., the characters in the TV shows she enjoys watching.\nWhile all of this is happening, Beatty notices the ear-piece in Montag\u2019s ears and reveals to him that he plans to hunt down Faber. Montag threatens his Captain with the flamethrower and, after Beatty smilingly asks Guy to hand his weapon over, burns his boss alive:\nAfterward, Montag flees the scene; but not before he has an encounter with the Mechanical Hound, \u201can eight-legged glass and metal contraption that serves as a surveillance tool and programmable killing machine for the firemen, who use it to track down suspected book hoarders and readers.\u201d\nFortunately, Montag manages to destroy the Mechanical Hound and somehow reaches the house of Faber.\nThe old man tells him to proceed to the countryside where he should find a bunch of exiled book-lovers. (Now there\u2019s a phrase which sounds strange no matter how many times we read it out loud.)\nMontag manages to escape another Mechanical Hound and a nationwide manhunt by swimming through a river; he comes ashore in the countryside, where he eventually happens upon the book-lovers.\nThere, a man named \nshows Guy the ongoing manhunt on a portable TV and tells him that he will be caught in a few minutes.\nAnd he is!\nWell, sort of.\nIt\u2019s actually \n Montag, aka, an innocent man caught and killed by the government forces so as to cover up Guy\u2019s escape and demonstrate to the rest of the population what happens to traitors.\nFahrenheit 451 Epilogue\nGuy learns that the exiled book-lovers are all former intellectuals and that each of them has memorized at least a few books in an attempt to contribute to the rebuilding of society if such a day comes when this one is annihilated by the imminent nuclear war.\nCoincidentally, the war happens that very night: bombers fly over the heads of the drifters and shatter the city into smithereens; it\u2019s a devastating one-day nuclear war, and the people in the countryside are practically the only ones who survive.\nWhile looking at a fire, Granger turns to his friends and tells them a story:\nAfter having a meal, the exiles head to the city, in an attempt to rebuild society a new with their knowledge.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cFahrenheit 451 PDF Summary Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nWinner of the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Literature in 1954 \nwas hailed as a masterpiece as soon as it was published. \nSeventy years later, it reads as if written for our day and age: unfortunately, many aspects of our societies seem to resemble the dystopian world of Bradbury\u2019s novel.\nJust sayin\u2019!\nIn case you ever have the urge to memorize books, start with Bradbury\u2019s."},

And Why?\nWe\u2019ve already summarized quite a few popular medical books on our site, some of which we had no option but to label as \u201cunscientific;\u201d well, this one falls under the same category.\nApparently, there are testimonials from people who say that the methods in this book have helped them, but, as always, we are skeptical. \nSo, read this book only if you have thyroid issues and want to try alternative methods; otherwise, trust your doctor.\nAbout Anthony William\n is a self-proclaimed medical medium.\nEven though he doesn\u2019t have a medical license, he offers medical and health advice to people based on information he allegedly receives from a spirit from the future.\nHe made his name as a \u201ctrusted expert\u201d for Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s GOOP website, through which he gained an almost cult-like following: at the moment, he has about 1.5 million followers on Instagram and twice that on Facebook.\nHe has authored five books so far: \n, \n, and \n.\nFind out more at \n \n\u201cMedical Medium Thyroid Healing PDF Summary\u201d\nAnthony William, the Medical Medium\n\u201cWhat will you find in this jewel of a book?\u201d asks Prudence Hall, M.D., in the first sentence of the \u201cForeword\u201d to \nAnd she instantly gives a straightforward answer: \u201cA fascinating and innovative approach to thyroid disease.\u201d\nHow could it not be?\nFor one, the author of the book is a self-proclaimed medical medium!\nAnd that means exactly what you\u2019d think it means: when he was just four years old, Anthony William was visited by the \u201cSpirit of the Most High, God\u2019s expression of compassion.\u201d \nTo the surprise and shock of his parents, he revealed to him that his symptomless grandmother is suffering from lung cancer, which medical studies later confirmed.\nEver since then, this Spirit speaks into William\u2019s ears as if one would speak to a friend, filling him in on the symptoms of everyone around him.\nPlus, according to William, this Spirit has taught him from an early age to see physical scans of people, \u201clike supercharged MRI scans that reveal all blockages, illnesses, infections, trouble areas, and past problems.\u201d\nIn other words, he\u2019s both Dr. House from the future and that guy from that \nepisode: he sees you, and he knows what you\u2019re up against.\nHis job?\nTo tell you the truth where science can\u2019t.\n\u201cTo go with the facts and figures about thyroid illness in the pages to come,\u201d he writes, \u201cyou won\u2019t find citations or mentions of scientific studies that have spawned from unproductive sources. You don\u2019t need to worry that this information will be proven wrong or superseded, as you do with other health books, because all of the health information I share here comes from a pure, untampered with, advanced, clean source \u2013 a higher source: the Spirit of Compassion. There\u2019s nothing more healing than compassion.\nThe Great Mistakes: What Your Thyroid Issues Are Not\nAccording to Anthony William, \u201cscience and the thyroid remain very distant from each other in this day and age.\u201d\nAnd this division is best-evidenced in the lack of a unifying explanation of people\u2019s thyroid issues; William considers all of the nine currently accepted as \u201cpossible causes\u201d for thyroid-related diseases as myths.\nHowever, be aware that William doesn\u2019t really have counter-arguments in more than one of the below cases; he thinks he knows better than all of these medical scientists because he converses with a Spirit from the future who has revealed to him that none of these theories are correct.\nAnd you can either believe him or not: his claims are unfalsifiable and would hardly survive more than a second \n.\nAccording to William, the very idea of autoimmune diseases (aka \u201ca condition arising from \n to a normal body part\u201d) is preposterous.\nHow can the body attack itself? \u2013 William shrieks in disgust.\nThe very word \u201cautoimmune,\u201d writes William, is \u201ca misnomer that means we can\u2019t even talk about the truth of autoimmune disease without perpetuating the misunderstanding.\u201d\n\u201cA more fitting term,\u201d he goes on, \u201cwould be \n, because the immune system is going after invaders.\u201d\nIn other words, even though there are at least 80 types of known autoimmune diseases, William firmly believes that our bodies never attack themselves; they solely go after pathogens.\nThe reason why doctors \n in autoimmune diseases is because \u201cfrustrated with not having an explanation for why conditions such as Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, Graves\u2019 disease, lupus, RA, Crohn\u2019s disease, celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, and MS were leaving people ailing or even crippled,\u201d the doctors from the 1950s invented the idea of the body attacking itself.\nAccording to William, \u201cthere are a minimum of 5,000 health issues that are still a mystery to medical science today.\u201d\nAnd one of the greatest mysteries of the medical sciences: chronic illnesses.\nIn other words, even though the doctors are \u201csome of the smartest, most honest people around,\u201d they are working within a \u201cbroken system\u201d which teaches them to not be puzzled by many diseases which, in truth, are unexplained and still bewildering.\nHowever, \u201cacting as though migraines, depression, Lyme disease, RA, fatigue, Candida, hot flashes, heart palpitations, diabetes, and so many other problems aren\u2019t baffling to experts is like ignoring the iceberg that the \n\u2019s about to strike.\u201d\n\u201cThis holds true for all the Great Mistakes,\u201d William makes a self-referential point; \u201cpretending they aren\u2019t there doesn\u2019t make them less of a hazard.\u201d\nYou know how uncomfortable you feel when you\u2019re in a relationship with someone, but all you can put as your Facebook status is \u201cit\u2019s complicated\u201d?\nWell, the same holds true for doctors \u2013 or for any other human profession, for that matter!\nIn other words, we don\u2019t want to deal with the unexplained or the inexplicable; so, we usually put labels and feel a lot more comfortable afterward.\nHowever, if you have ever watched \n, we\u2019re pretty sure that by now you know for a fact that putting a \n label over something is much more dangerous than not putting any label.\nUnfortunately \u2013 we can\u2019t stress this enough \u2013 most doctors are working within a system which forces them to put labels even when they are not so sure.\n\u201cInflammation\u201d is another label, and one of those which get thrown around just too liberally for William\u2019s taste.\n\u201cYou see inflammation deemed to be the cause of everything from cancer to obesity to heart disease, and it\u2019s a huge topic in thyroid illness and autoimmune disease,\u201d writes William.\nAnd true, almost everywhere you turn, foods and supplements are being advertised as anti-inflammatory and \n advice against eating some foods because they are inherently inflammatory.\nThe problem?\nGluten, grains, wheat, etc. cause problems in some people, but not in others.\nThe reason?\nAccording to William, that only the first group of people is susceptible is because they harbor in their bodies viruses which feed on the grains and fungi, resulting in inflammation.\nOnce again, inflammation is a label which hides the real cause: viruses.\nYou\u2019ve heard this so many times: someone can\u2019t lose weight, and someone else blames it on their slow metabolism; someone else is in tiptop shape, and a third person says that it\u2019s all because of his/her fast, healthy metabolism.\nNews flash: metabolism is just another label which actually hides the real problems.\nMetabolism isn\u2019t \u201cthe driving force of mystery weight issues,\u201d and neither is responsible for many autoimmune diseases.\nHowever, it\u2019s a word that\u2019s been just \naccepted to be easily dismissed.\nIt should be, says William.\nScience (\n) would beg to differ, but Anthony William thinks that \u201cwe can\u2019t be fooled into thinking genes mean \n:\u201d\nWilliam calls the Unforgiving Four \u201cthe four outside factors that are the real problems behind chronic and mystery illness,\u201d and considers it a Big Mistake on our part to ignore them.\nThe Unforgiving Four are the viral explosion, radiation, \n, and toxic heavy metals.\nEven though William ascribes only about 5% of thyroid issues to the last three (see below), we kind of agree with the essence of this one.\nNeither of these should be ignored; and, as far as we know, nobody has ignored either of these Four Unforgiving Outside Factors for at least half a century.\n\u201cI hope to God that this becomes a mistake of the past soon,\u201d writes Anthony William in relation to Great Mistake #8, i.e., \u201cIt\u2019s All in Your Head.\u201d\nAnd he\u2019s right yet again: not very few doctors, after being unable to find any symptoms or reach conclusive results via science-backed tests, start convincing their patients that \u201cit\u2019s all in their heads.\u201d\nThe truth is, as developed science is, sometimes it just doesn\u2019t have the answers or the tests to discover the real problems.\nAnd, \n, \u201creports about sensations and feelings are incorrigible.\u201d \n\u201cYou created your illness,\u201d writes Anthony William, \u201cis a new, hip, repackaged version of \u2018It\u2019s all in your head.\u2019\u201d\nIt\u2019s as unscientific as saying that \n through the power of your mind; because, after all, if you can create a disease by merely thinking too forcefully that you have it, then why shouldn\u2019t you be able to heal it through the very same method?\nOnce again, William is more than right.\nThe True Cause of Thyroid Issues\nAccording to Anthony William \u2013 and, as the subtitle suggests, this is the main idea of this book \u2013 the true cause of all thyroid problems is a virus, more specifically, the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). \nWilliam calls the EBV the \u201cthyroid virus\u201d for the simple reason that he believes it is responsible for 95% of all thyroid problems.\n\u201cThe other 5 percent of thyroid problems,\u201d he writes, \u201ccome from radiation exposure due to chest, dental, and other X-rays; CT scans; food and water supply contamination; plane travel; cell phones; inheritance of our parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 exposure; and the continuous atmospheric radiation fallout from past nuclear disasters.\u201d\nAccording to William, the EBV has four stages, and medical communities know only about two of them: the baby stage (when the virus is dormant or quietly replicating), and the war stage (when the EBV evolves into mononucleosis and some minor diseases).\nHowever, it is the third stage, aka \u201cthe thyroid stage\u201d which is really the problem and the phase in which the virus evolves into most of the diseases which are stated in the subtitle of William\u2019s book.\nStage four is \u201cthe mystery illness stage,\u201d aka \u201cthe one that results the most in sufferers feeling or being told that they are crazy, lazy, liars, and/or delusional.\u201d\nIn other words, almost everything from fatigue and despondency to Hashimoto\u2019s and Graves\u2019 to fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis (MS) to ADHD and depersonalization is caused by the EBV attacking your thyroid (or other organs) at a different stage of development.\nThe problem is, stage three and stage four are undetectable by current testing methods, so doctors and people think that it\u2019s autoimmune or mysterious diseases they\u2019re dealing with.\nWilliam\u2019s Spirit says: \n!\nIt\u2019s EBV.\nKey Lessons from \u201cMedical Medium Thyroid Healing\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thyroid Myths: The Great Mistakes in Your Way\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Real, True Cause of Thyroid-Related Diseases\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resurrect Your Thyroid: Foods, Herbs, Supplements, and Sleep\nThyroid Myths: The Great Mistakes in Your Way\nDespite his sincere admiration for medical scientists, medical medium Anthony William claims that they\u2019ve gotten everything wrong as far as thyroid-related diseases are concerned.\nAnd he dedicates the second part of his book to debunking the many (in his opinion) myths surrounding these diseases, calling them the great mistakes of medical science.\n#1. Autoimmune Confusion\n#2. Mystery Illness Misconception\n#3. Labels as Answers\n#4. Inflammation as Cause\n#5. Metabolism Myth\n#6. Gene Blame Game\n#7. Ignoring the Unforgiving Four\n#8. It\u2019s All in Your Head\n#9. You Created Your Illness\nAccording to Anthony William, neither of these is the true explanation behind your thyroid issues.\nThe Real, True Cause of Thyroid-Related Diseases\nIn other words, regardless of whether you\u2019re suffering from Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, Graves\u2019 disease, hyper- or hypothyroidism, thyroid nodules, endometriosis, or even thyroid cancer, it all boils down to a single cause: the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)\nAccording to Anthony William, even though scientists believe that the EBV has only two stages, there are actually four, the second of which is mononucleosis and the third one the thyroid stage; William calls the fourth one mystery illness stage, and he may be one of the very few who knows anything about that since, in his words, \u201cmany people never reach this stage.\u201d\nResurrect Your Thyroid: Foods and Supplements \nIn \n, William goes into great detail about what foods to include and what foods to avoid if you want to heal your thyroid.\nThe trick (of course) is to \n give the EBV anything it wants and to include in your daily intake the foods and supplements that could kill it.\nAnd, apparently, the EBV really likes eggs, cheese, and gluten; and it really hates artichokes. Other foods which starve EBV include apples, avocados, bananas, coconuts, dates, figs, garlic, ginger, lemons, mangoes, nuts, oranges, etc. etc.\nAs far as supplements are concerned, among many other things, use vitamin B\n, zinc, vitamin C, and spirulina (for some reason, preferably from Hawaii).\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cMedical Medium Thyroid Healing Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nTo our eyes, \ndoes not seem like a science-based or science-backed book \u2013 regardless of whether we\u2019re talking about present-day or future-day science.\nIn other words, you\u2019d be best off not even reading it, let alone actually using its advice; as Jennifer Gunter says, the minimum is that you\u2019d waste money, \u201cbut there is great potential for harm with many of the therapies that are recommended and delays in diagnosis.\u201d\nThe final verdict: skip this one."},

Cuts have decimated the office, and the BJC is down to its last few investigators. \n\u201cSeven,\u201d writes Grisham, \u201cin a state of twenty million people, with a thousand judges sitting in six hundred courtrooms and processing a half a million cases a year.\u201d\nNo wonder that \n \u2013 one of the main characters of our story whom we\u2019ll meet in just a second \u2013 is \u201cforever grateful that almost all judges were honest, hardworking people committed to justice and equality. Otherwise, she would have left long ago. The small number of bad apples kept her busy fifty hours a week.\u201d\nMeet Ramsey Mix, aka Greg Myers\nThe above-mentioned \n is the investigator assigned to the case. \nShe is not a cop but a lawyer, and responding to calls such as these is part of her work description. However, most of them amount to nothing, and after nine years with the Board on Judicial Conduct she has learned that most problems are not caused by corruption, but incompetence.\nTogether with her partner \n, Lacy heads to St. Augustine to meet the source in person \u2013 and find out everything he knows (or doesn\u2019t know) about USA\u2019s most corrupt judge.\nNow, this person turns out to be a guy named \n, a lawyer by trade, who\u2019s living on a boat called \n,\nwhose address is the address of his brother and who has a single client whose name he doesn\u2019t know.\nAlready shady?\nWait till you hear this: Ramsey is also an ex-con, having spent sixteen months in a federal camp after pleading to one count of mail fraud back in the days when he had practiced law with a license.\nAnd there\u2019s more:\nHis name is actually \nat the moment, the name he intends to use to file a complaint without which the BJC cannot proceed with the case.\nNo wonder Lacy suddenly starts doubting \u201cthe wisdom of traveling to St.\u00a0Augustine to meet this guy. A state employee too frightened to come forward. A reformed lawyer so spooked that he went to court in another state and changed his name. An ex-con with no real address.\u201d\nAnother problem?\nMix is not really interested in answering the usual questions an investigator might ask his or her source.\nAnd yet \u2013 he claims he has a story like no other.\nGreg Myers\u2019 Story\n\u201cThis is a long story that will take some time to unfold,\u201d says Ramsey Mix during the first of the few meetings he has with Lacy and Hugo. \u201cIt involves a ton of money, corruption that is astonishing, and some really nasty guys who wouldn\u2019t think twice about putting a bullet or two between my eyes, yours, my client\u2019s, anyone who asks too many questions.\u201d\nAnd throughout the following few chapters, we learn that the most corrupt judge in USA\u2019s history is a woman named \n presiding over Florida\u2019s 24\n Circuit and living in Brunswick County, a fictional place located somewhere between Pensacola and Tallahassee, in the unofficial Florida Panhandle.\nAnd then Greg proceeds to tell Lacy and Hugo quite a few things about the Honorable Claudia McDover.\nFirst, he shares quite a few personal details:\nNow Claudia wasn\u2019t carved for small-town practice, so, very soon, she got bored with her job; and then she met a guy named \n, \u201ca bad dude but a very smart man.\u201d\nDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll meet him in an instant as well.\nNow, after meeting Vonn Dubose, Claudia McDover suddenly developed an interest in politics and ran for circuit court judge.\nCoincidentally, this happened in 1993, very soon after the Tappacola Nation \u2013 \u201ca small tribe of about four hundred scattered along the Panhandle\u201d \u2013 voted against the opening of a casino in the serenity of their Reservation.\nThe man who approached them with the idea: the afore-mentioned \n.\nThe man who eventually emerged victorious: \u201can agitator named \n,\u201d a Christian who opposes gambling on moral grounds.\nNow, back to Claudia: after a well-funded and well-organized campaign, McDover beats the incumbent by a thousand votes and wins the position of a circuit court judge.\nJust a month after she takes office, Son Razko is murdered, his body found in another man\u2019s bedroom, along with this other man\u2019s wife, both shot twice in the head.\nOf course, the main suspect is the husband, a man named \n, coincidentally a close ally of Razko during their anti-gambling campaign.\nJudge McDover presides over his trial and, of course, Mace is convicted for the double murder, despite steadfastly claiming his innocence.\nYou can already guess where this story is going.\nThe mastermind behind everything is Vonn Dubose, the leader of the so-called Coast Mafia and a descendant of one of the original gangsters of the county who had begun their mischief in \u201cthe rear room of a catfish restaurant near Forrest City, Arkansas.\u201d\nHis story:\nNow, having planned everything in advance, Vonn Dubose spent the few years between the first anti-gambling vote and the murder of Razko buying property off all the investors and speculators who had jumped in when it looked like the Tappacola wanted a casino.\n\u201cHe knew what was coming and soon had the Indian land surrounded,\u201d says Mix. \u201cWith Son Razko out of the way, and removed in such a dramatic fashion, the proponents won the second election. The rest is history.\u201d\nSo, in a nutshell, everything was clear now for more than two decades of utmost corruption, starting with the construction of \u201cTreasure Key,\u201d\nThe rest is as simple as a Martin Scorsese\u2019s movie gets: Vonn Dubose took care of everyone he didn\u2019t like (\u201che whittled his gang down to just a handful of cousins so there would be fewer hands in the till\u201d) and Judge McDover made sure that there are no legal obstacles between Dubose and the realization of his master plan.\nEven better, Van Dubose \u201coperated with complete anonymity and hid behind a wall of offshore companies, all of which were overseen by a certain law firm in Biloxi.\u201d\nThings Escalate\nQuite expectedly \u2013 as Lacy and Hugo would learn the hard way \u2013 a guy with such power and wealth is not to be brought down easily.\nAfter hearing things here and there about an ongoing investigation in his dealings, Vonn Dubose lures investigators Stoltz and Hatch to a rural part of the Tappacola Reservation.\nThe bait?\nA member of the Tappacola nation who claims that he has important information which might interest Lacy and Hugo.\nHowever, there\u2019s no such thing: it\u2019s all a ruse which ends with a truck deliberately striking the car of Stoltz and Hatch, killing the latter and severely injuring the former.\nIronically, Dubose\u2019s tactic to neutralize the BJC ends up as the catalyst for his own neutralization.\nNow, the director of the BJC, \n, is convinced that there are even higher stakes involved than he had previously imagined and calls in the aid of the Federal Bureau.\nWith their help, the BJC discovers the identity of Hugo\u2019s henchmen and offers them a deal in exchange for some information and testimonies in relation to the relationship between Vonn Dubose, the Coast Mafia, and the Not-So-Honorable Judge McDover.\nThey, of course, agree.\nThe Whistler Epilogue\nBefore too long, Vonn Dubose and Judge McDover realize that someone very close to at least one of them must be leaking information about their whole operation.\nThe main suspect?\n, Judge McDover\u2019s recorder of seven years, the actual name of Mix\u2019s client and the real whistler of the title.\nRealizing the danger she\u2019s in, Hooper flees her job and settles in a cheap hotel; however, she\u2019s tracked by the Coast Mafia and, soon enough, she has a hitman on her heels.\nNow recovered, Lacy Stoltz helps Hooper to escape the hitman and takes her to the airport in Valdosta where Lacy\u2019s brother, Gunther Stoltz \u2013 a real estate developer from Atlanta \u2013 flies the two women to western North Carolina.\nThere, the two hide in a lakeside cabin in the mountains, waiting for the FBI to finish what the two had started.\nAnd the FBI does: the Dubose syndicate is dismantled, the main culprits are arrested, and Judge McDover is sentenced to a quarter of a century in prison.\n\u201cFrail and much thinner after seventeen months of jailhouse food,\u201d in all her stoicism, McDover is merely a shadow of her former self.\nIn the front row, Lacy, with Special Agent \n on one side and JoHelen on the other, \u201calmost felt sorry for her.\u201d\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Whistler PDF Summary Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nAs a \nreview states, \u201cGrisham has become an institution\u2026 Grisham\u2019s legal knowledge is impressive, and his ability to convey it unparalleled in popular fiction.\u201d\nAnd \n\u2013 just like most of his books \u2013 disappoints not one bit. \nWe predict a blockbuster movie within five years."},

Trump of colluding with the Russians, and accused him of being a collaborator.\nWhat led to this?\nLet\u2019s dig up the mystery and see what was going on behind the curtains.\nWho Should Read \u201cThe Russia Hoax\u201d? And Why?\nLet\u2019s take an apolitical stance here, and for argument\u2019s sake, try not to take sides in a political sense.\n is mainly a revelation related to the whole mainstream narrative tilted against the current president of the United States.\nAs such, we encourage everyone with the slightest interest in US politics, to give it a read.\nAbout Gregg Jarrett\n is an American news anchor, author, and an attorney who joined Fox News in 2002.\nHe voiced concern over the alleged crimes and violations committed by Trump\u2019s administration during the Elections. \nGregg called out Hillary for her email controversy and compared the FBI to the KGB (Former Intelligence Gathering and Counter-Espionage Organization within the Soviet Union).\n\u201cThe Russia Hoax PDF Summary\u201d\nYou must have been living under a rock unless you\u2019ve heard the rumor spreading like wildfire, that Donald Trump mingled with the Russians to defeat Hillary in the 2016 Presidential Elections.\nIt all started with Hillary\u2019s private server and email scandal.\nMany wonder, why Hillary Clinton wanted to keep her communications as a secretary of state on a private server?\nProbably because that way, she could avoid applying the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in its full extent. Before taking office, she made a pledge of sustaining full transparency and vowed to embrace and fulfill all acts from the FOIA.\nA sequence of events arouse suspicion, and the FBI launched an investigation to see whether passing classified documents was handled carelessly.\nThey came to a startling discovery when they realized that Obama has been acting negligently as well. Exposing Hillary would have probably brought Obama\u2019s egregious violation of \n and security to light, as well.\nHillary continued to act irresponsibly and would often breach security protocols, but no one dared to oppose her.\nEven the State Department security personnel had to intervene because Hillary had a habit of keeping her BlackBerry in an area where hackers could easily penetrate and gather valuable intel on US policies.\nIn 2014, the House Benghazi Committee demanded that Hillary Clinton gave access to her emails which she reluctantly accepted.\nIt was later discovered that Hillary withheld more than 30k emails, that she claimed were of more personal nature.\nMany of the shared ones, were classified but that didn\u2019t prevent her from using an insecure server.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Hillary was aware of breaking the federal law and neglecting the State regulations.\nAfter being scolded and pinned down, Hillary decided to delete more than thirty thousand of her emails, even though she received a congressional subpoena to preserve them.\nThis is by many regarded as a clear obstruction of a federal investigation and a violation of the Federal Records Act. \nMany believe; among them is former independent counsel Joseph diGenova that Hillary didn\u2019t want to abide by the rules.\nDespite holding a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School, she acted in direct confrontation with the law and should have been charged with embezzling government documents.\nA sufficient amount of evidence shows that Clinton felt invulnerable and above the regulations.\nDespite breaking multiple federal laws, Hillary defended the utility of the personal server as a tool for convenience. \nOn July 5\n, 2016, James Comey held a conference to unravel the violations of federal law committed by \u201csomeone.\u201d \nThe entire country believed that Hillary\u2019s political career is about to receive a hard blow.\nBut that\u2019s not what happened.\nAfter dismissing Hillary\u2019s notion that she didn\u2019t know which files are classified, and exposing the threat to National Security, James Comey refused to proceed with the prosecution and said the following:\nWhen the evidence laid out showcases violations of security protocols, it should be regarded as a basis for the Department of Justice to step in. \nJames Comey had no grounds whatsoever to make such statements and give preferential treatment to Hillary.\nThe American public might also remember the prosecutions of Berger, Petraeus, Deutch, Nishimura, and Saucier whose crimes and transgressions resembled the Clinton case.\nBut none of these individuals who had access to classified and top-secret documents served time behind bars.\nFor their negligence, they were denied other privileges.\nMuch of the information behind FBI director James Comey\u2019s decision was concealed, and criminal charges were not pressed against former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. \nSome even argue that the FBI (some people in it) were directly linked to the exoneration of Hillary despite the meticulous case laid out against her.\nDespite the irrefutable evidence that strongly upheld the claim that Hillary\u2019s misdemeanor threatened the country\u2019s security, she was let off the hook.\nThe American public, especially those leaning to the right of the political spectrum, were kept in the dark.\nSome FBI agents and lawyers bent over backward to conceal as much as possible regarding the damage she has caused and kept her away from testifying to Congress.\nAccording to Gregg, the word \u201ctruth\u201d is, by all means, a distant concept to Hillary and always has been.\nBack in 2010, under Obama\u2019s administration, the Russian Federation tried to obtain uranium assets and have them shipped to Moscow. The FBI was keenly aware of the strategies used by the Russians which involved bribery, racketeering, extortion, but decided to keep their mouths shut.\nThe evidence was considerable, and there was no doubt that venal individuals had a role in facilitating the transaction.\nIt was not until William Douglas Campbell exposed the means by which the Russians planned to seize American uranium, that the whole case came to a clearing.\nCampbell also discovered that Russia was assisting Iran in its attempt to obtain Nuclear warheads.\nIn light of this new evidence, the American Public and Congress became curious regarding the involvement of Clintons in the whole deal-making process. \nApparently, Hillary Clinton used its position to confer special privileges to the Russian Federation in exchange for millions of dollars in donations to her foundation.\nAfter the loss in 2016, she realized that foreign companies wouldn\u2019t be too keen in proceeding with the donations, which is what she was fearful of. \nAs it turns out, Hillary Clinton put the blame on Trump for colluding with the Russians.\nWith no substantial evidence to back it up, the FBI launched an investigation.\nIt was clearly a hoax contrived by corrupt officials within the FBI and the Department of Justice.\nAs Gregg puts it \u2013 perhaps they were motivated by the Stalinist way of judgment: \nThe method of disparaging a presidential candidate was nothing new in modern-day warfare, and it was driven by the political dislike of American institutions.\nThe ICA report found no evidence whatsoever that Russia had successfully influenced US elections by discrediting Hillary and elevating Trump.\nWhen Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada sent a letter to James Comey, claiming that evidence confirming Trump\u2019s alleged collusion continues to pile up, all hell broke loose. This was the most bizarre and fraudulent case ever brought up in recent American Politics.\nDonald Trump was basically accused of being a Russian agent, working against American interests.\nCongresswoman Maxine Waters, renowned in the political sphere for her intemperate attitude, promised that she would unwrap Trump\u2019s agenda that might undermine the pillars of US democracy.\nWhat followed was silence as she offered nothing to support her statements.\nThe Intelligence Services once pressed to the wall, had to admit that there was no proof of collusion, despite the narrative continuously pushed forward by the mainstream media.\nWhat was the fuss all about?\nApparently, Trump talked to the Russians, as if it is a crime to talk to someone.\nMore than one thousand US businesses currently operate in Russia, and the Government itself has signed trade deals on a bilateral basis.\nA throwback to 2008, when Barack Obama paid a visit to Germany before the Presidential Elections, no one said that he was conspiring with the Germans.\nBut, that didn\u2019t stop anyone from fabricating a dossier to be used against Donald Trump.\nAnd yet the FBI decided to criminalize and prosecute protected speech, while at the same time, they saw nothing wrong in conferring benefits to foreign legal bodies (including governments) in exchange for money.\nJohn Brennan, former head of the CIA, decided not to take a critical view of the dossier nor vouch for its authenticity. As a person wielding a lot of power and influence, his job was to dive deep into the alleged offenses, according to which Donald J. Trump had the upper hand in the Presidental Elections.\nThat\u2019s not what he opted to do, instead, he leaned on untrustworthy sources which were not credible in the least.\nWhen turned upside down, the \u201cdossier\u201d was literally a collection of rumors, agendas, plots, conspiracies, suspicion, speculation but no evidence. The false statements gained momentum with the help of the mainstream media, but they lacked validity. \nUpon reading the content, Brennan surely must have known that it\u2019s by no means trustworthy.\nDue to the nature of his job, he was supposed to be an apolitical voice, but instead, he chose a more biased approach.\nLet\u2019s look at it this way.\nIn order to search a house, you need a warrant issued by a judge. The same applies when the government wants to keep an eye on someone and penetrate its personal life. You need to provide reliable information that is obtained from credible sources before you receive the go-ahead.\nBut that surely wasn\u2019t the case with the Clintons.\nHillary partnered with the DNC, and through their lawyer, Elias solicited negative research on Trump and his campaign. The goal was to set the stage for other accusations while claiming that it\u2019s only opposition research. \nWhat followed was probably the biggest turnaround in American Politics, when Donald Trump became the 45\n President of the US.\nSpecial Counsel investigation that commenced in 2017, also known as the Mueller probe found no evidence whatsoever regarding the Russian interference in US elections.\nThe Witch Hunt was brought to a halt.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Russia Hoax\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Focus on trust, not on deceit\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lay out your program\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accept the outcome\nFocus on trust, not on deceit\nThe political game is not for those with the faint of heart.\nHowever, living by the rule \u2013 ends justify the means, will do you no good on the long run; which is what \n.\nLay out your program\nWhen you want people to vote for you, your whole narrative must be built around your Party\u2019s plans, not someone else\u2019s inclinations.\nPerhaps, the next Democratic candidate should keep that in mind.\nAccept the outcome\nPrior to the big event, Hillary said on numerous occasions that Donald Trump must accept the results of the elections.\nAnd yet, it was the Democrats who failed to do so.\nTry to keep your word, and you\u2019ll improve your ratings among the people.\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free \n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Russia Hoax Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nWell, it would be for the best if everyone waited for evidence before making any rash judgments.\nThese days, we kind of have abandoned the core principle of democracy \u2013 the presumption of innocence and turned to a more \n.\nThat must change, and we must embrace \u201cInnocent until proven Guilty\u201d because if we do not, tyranny might take over."},

And Why?\nThere are already \n, and, in a way, \noffers very few new or different insights.\nHowever, it is certainly a book you\u2019d like to check out if you want to attain happiness: Carlson was both a psychotherapist and a pretty popular motivational speaker, so you\u2019ve got nothing to lose.\nEspecially since this is one of his top 3 books.\nAbout Richard Carlson\n was an American psychotherapist, bestselling author, and motivational speaker.\nHe became a nationwide celebrity about a decade after debuting with his first book: \n topped both the \n\u2019s and \n bestseller lists for about hundred weeks and ended up being translated into about 30 languages.\nProlific author, Carlson wrote twenty books before passing suddenly while on tour, in the 46\n year of his life.\nBe sure to check out our summaries for \n and \nas well\nFind out more at \n \n\u201cYou Can Be Happy No Matter What PDF Summary\u201d\n\u201cIn this extraordinary book,\u201d writes Dr. Wayne Dyer in the \u201cPreface\u201d to \n,\nDr. Carlson explains that life is not your enemy, but your thinking can be.\u201d\nTo those already familiar with Ricard Carlson\u2019s work, this is nothing new: at the very basis of his philosophy \u2013 or, better yet, psychology \u2013 of happiness is the \n that \u201cthere is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.\u201d \nPut simply, we are thinking creatures \u2013 that\u2019s why biologists refer to our species as \n \u2013 but, unfortunately, we don\u2019t always think the way we \n be; had we the power to do that, then we would have been much happier.\nBecause \u2013 and this is one of the main ideas of \n \u2013 happiness is not something we should \n, but something we need to learn how to \n; happiness is, to quote Dyer once again, \u201cnot the end of the road; it\u2019s the beginning.\u201d \nExpectedly, Carlson\u2019s objective with this book is to teach us how never to let our happiness slip away from us; in order to do that, he extracts five principles which should \u201cact as navigational tools to help you find contentment in your life.\u201d \nHe explains them in detail in the first part of the book; since this is the far more important segment, we\u2019ll dedicate our attention in the summary below almost exclusively to this part.\nIn the second five-chapter part (appropriately titled \u201cApplying the Principles\u201d), Carlson gives a few examples on how to employ the knowledge from the first part in real-life situations; the subjects covered here are relationships, stress, solving problems, happiness, and health and addictions.\nThe book ends with a chapter titled \u201cA Checklist for Your Life.\u201d\nHappiness Is a Natural State\nIf you are like most of the people, you probably believe that your life is just a series of misfortunate events interspersed with brief periods of happiness \u2013 and not the other way around.\nRichard Carlson thinks otherwise.\n\u201cOur most natural state of mind,\u201d he writes, \u201cis one of contentment and joy. The barriers or obstructions that keep us from experiencing these positive feelings are learned negative processes that we have innocently come to accept as \u2018necessary,\u2019 or as \u2018just the way life is.\u2019\u201d\nLet us rephrase that so you can understand it better.\nYou are born and created to be happy, filled with inner peace, satisfaction, curiosity, affection, and feelings of gratitude for the ones you love and are loved by. If you don\u2019t believe us, just have a look at absolutely any child playing a game, and you\u2019ll understand what this actually means.\nHowever, you spend a large part of your life learning and acquiring behaviors and habits which hinder your chance at happiness.\nHow?\nWell, by simply hacking your brain into thinking that it\u2019s in a constant struggle and should be constantly aware of it.\nIf you want to be happy in life, your job is simple: to remove these obstructions and, thus, uncover the inherent positive feelings you are born with, your natural state, the one Carlson refers to as \u201chealthy psychological functioning\u201d or simply \u201ca nice feeling.\u201d\nThe result is a more meaningful and beautiful experience of life.\nThe Key to Happiness: Your Mind\nIf permanent happiness is not something which comes from the outside (aka it is not something you\u2019ll attain after solving some problems or, say, getting that job you want), it is only natural that the inside-out change of perspective starts and ends with your mind, the alpha and omega of your body.\nAnd as Carlson says, your mind is a two-fold organism, which serves you in two different ways:\nYou can already sense the problem: computers are not only impractical but virtually useless if you want to find an answer to some of the biggest questions in life.\nWhy?\nBecause in cases such as, say, marriage or relationship problems, we usually don\u2019t have all the variables, and computers are incapable of taking a leap of faith.\nLet\u2019s put it this way: the computer part of your brain is memory-based; the transmitter part is insight-based. Which one of the two you\u2019d use to solve a \n problem if you had a choice?\nThat\u2019s right!\n\u201cNew answers don\u2019t come from what you already know in the computer part of your brain,\u201d writes Carlson, \u201c\n.\u201d\nThe Principles\nSo, to sum up, your mind can either work \nor \nyou; the computer part is helpful in many cases, but it is unwise to use it in \nsituations and circumstances.\nHowever, since you have done this for years, you\u2019ve already created an impermeable layer beneath which your inherent happiness struggles for breath in the transmitter part of your mind.\nReaching it will make your life less complicated and your problems more trivial, allowing you to be more lighthearted and easygoing.\nAnd the best way to do this is to begin understanding your transmitter mind, the source of these deep, positive feelings.\nCarlson\u2019s five principles should help you.\nThe first four of these are based on a series of psychological principles originally formulated by Rick Suarez and Roger Mills in their 1987 book \n; the fifth \u2013 and we\u2019re pretty sure you already now that one \u2013 is addition by Carlson.\nThese are the five principles in brief, as described by Carlson:\n\u2022 \n. \u201cOur ability to think creates our psychological experience of life, and thinking is a voluntary function.\u201d\n\u2022 \n. \u201cOur own understanding that thinking is a voluntary function fluctuates from moment to moment and from day to day; these variances are called moods.\u201d\n\u2022 \n. \u201cBecause we all think in a unique way, each of us lives in a separate psychological reality.\u201d\n\u2022 \n. \u201cOur feelings and emotions serve as a built-in biofeedback mechanism that lets us know how we are doing from a psychological standpoint.\u201d\n\u2022 \n. \u201cLearning to keep our attention in the present moment, by paying attention to our feelings, allows us to live at peak efficiency and without the distraction of negative thinking.

This constant shifting in our awareness of ourselves as the thinker is what is known as changing \u2018moods.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cTime cools, time clarifies,\u201d wrote once Thomas Mann, \u201cno mood can be maintained quite unaltered through the course of hours.\u201d\nSometimes you\u2019re in high spirits, other times you just want to lie in your bed, binge-watch a TV show and eat some ice-cream.\nIn either case, what\u2019s changing is not your life or reality \u2013 but your mood; sometimes, just when everything seems so perfect, your mood levels drop and life suddenly seems unbearable; other times, life is hopeless, but then a mood shift brings the butterflies and the rainbows.\nThe point?\nIf neither mood is eternal, then it\u2019s only reasonable to make decisions and find solutions to problems when you\u2019re in high mood:\nThe Principle of Separate Realities\nYou know what they say: no two human beings are the same.\nAnd you know why is that?\nBecause everyone\u2019s thinking mode produces a very unique frame of reference; as we said introducing the first principle, the very same event can be interpreted in numerous different ways by different people; multiple that by thousand, and you realize how different and varying worldviews can be.\nThe problem?\nYou spend a lot of energy trying to change someone else\u2019s opinions and beliefs; and chances are, within \n frame of reference, the things you say echo in unpredictable manners and eventually end up meaning things you won\u2019t understand.\nThe solution?\nStop trying to change others. \nThe better way is just to accept the fact that everyone lives in a separate \n of reality and to open your heart and mind to other people\u2019s visions of the world around you.\nThat\u2019s what makes growth and compromise possible, and that\u2019s what humanity is all about.\nThe Principle of Feelings\nThe epigraph to this chapter is a quote by Sheila Krystal: \nYou are only one thought away from a good feeling.\u201d\nIts essence: something Epicurus and his followers firmly believed, i.e., that your feelings are good indicators of \n you should think:\nCarlson provides a good analogy to understand this: \u201cwhen a warning light flashes in our car,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe particular reason why it\u2019s flashing is not as crucial at first as the fact that \n. The thing to do is pull off the road and turn off the motor.\u201d\nIn other words, anger, jealousy, resentment, greed, depression \u2013 these are all just signs that you\u2019ve wandered off your healthy psychological functioning.\nIf you don\u2019t stop the car and see what\u2019s wrong with it, you may run out of gas or realize that your breaks are not working at the next bend.\nBut then \u2013 it might be too late.\nThe Principle of Present Moment\nLive in the moment.\n\u201cVirtually every spiritual teacher throughout history has suggested this solution,\u201d reminds us Carlson. \u201cIn fact, this may be one of the oldest and wisest pieces of advice for living a happier life.\u201d\nThe wisdom behind this advice is too simple to require an analysis: all you have is \n; everything else is just an illusion \u2013 even if it is the past.\nIf you allow your mind to wander off too often, you\u2019ll entrap yourself within illusions; a mind that is not living in the moment is a mind perfectly prepared for a whirlwind of worries and regrets.\nOn the other hand, a mind that is living in the moment is a mind in which contentment, satisfaction, and happiness are not just possible, but a natural state of existence.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cYou Can Be Happy No Matter What Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nis not Richard Carlson\u2019s best book \u2013 that has to be, surely, \nbut it\u2019s up there with \nand \nWorth a check \u2013 if not a more dedicated reading."},

And Why?\nIn the \u201cIntroduction\u201d to \n, right after referring to Carl Jung\u2019s belief that \u201cthe greatest affliction affecting mankind isn\u2019t serious mental illness \u2013 but the general uneasiness and unhappiness that is so prevalent in our society,\u201d Richard Carlson\ngives an answer to the questions above we felt we are entitled to quote in full:\n\u201cThis book was written for anyone who would like to feel better than they presently do \u2013 anyone who frequently experiences \u2018the blues,\u2019 ongoing sadness, a pessimistic outlook, frequent unhappiness, internal misery, a lack of gratitude about the gift of life \u2013 or someone who simply wishes to \n.\u201d\nAbout Richard Carlson\n was an American psychotherapist and bestselling author.\nThough he had published nine books before that, he first rose to prominence in 1997 with the publication of \n; an extraordinary success, the book was a bestseller for the next two years and has been translated in the meantime into more than 20 languages.\nCarlson wrote ten more books after that, before passing away suddenly at 46 from a pulmonary embolism.\nIn addition to his classic, feel free to check out our summaries for \n and \nas well\nFind out more at \n \n\u201cStop Thinking, Start Living PDF Summary\u201d\nOriginally published as \nin 1992, \ngoes over many common-sense strategies which should help you leave doubts and anxieties aside so that you can finally start living a healthy and happy life.\nBefore we provide you with a chapter-by-chapter summary of the book, we feel that it\u2019s necessary to make a few terminological distinctions regarding a few words we will probably use quite often below:\n\u2022 \n: the intelligence behind all life;\n\u2022 \nbeing aware of your existence;\n\u2022 \n: the thing which helps you interpret reality;\n\u2022 \n: the actual objective reality, regardless of how you interpret it. \nChapter 1: Possibilities\nAccording to Richard Carlson, \u201chappiness is a moment-to-moment choice that each of us makes. In order to be happy, you must first \n to be happy.\u201d\nIt may sound strange at first, but it actually works that way.\nIf you don\u2019t believe us, just think of all those sudden shifts in your consciousness when, despite the external stimuli remaining the same, you suddenly start feeling a lot better.\nJames Joyce called these \n, and Carlson refers to them as \u201cchanges of heart.\u201d\nEither way, they are not intrinsically related to the reality of the external world; and therein lie all the possibilities of happiness.\nChapter 2: Your Thoughts and the Way You Feel\nWe are all \nthinking. \nTry to grasp the reality behind this, because, most probably, you are not aware of it: even when you\u2019re trying not to think, you are actually thinking; that\u2019s why \n and that\u2019s why Carlson compares thinking to breathing.\nNow, don\u2019t get us wrong: thinking constantly is a good thing; it can be an even better one if you are aware of the fact what thinking \n is.\nYou may better understand what it is if you understand what it is not; and it is certainly \nthe real world around you.\nIn other words, no matter how convinced you are in something, that doesn\u2019t make it true; the very fact that there\u2019s someone else who\u2019s convinced into something quite the opposite leaves a lot of space for reasonable doubt.\nYou\u2019ve thought of thinking as a process similar to breathing in terms of its automatic nature, and now you should think of thinking as a process similar to dreaming in terms of its reality. Though both are essentially the same, for some reason, we think of dreaming as something false and of our thoughts as something necessarily right.\nWhy is it important to understand that what you think about something has no effect on that something?\nBecause that way you\u2019ll understand that your feelings are an illusion as well; because they are actually formed by your thoughts.\nIf you think that the loss of your favorite football team grants the anger it produces, then you\u2019ll be angry; if however, you think that it\u2019s just a trivial event, life should go on as usual.\nRemember: you don\u2019t \nreality; you feel your thought interpreting reality.\nChapter 3: Healthy Psychological Functioning\nAccording to Richard Carlson, healthy psychological functioning is our natural state \u2013 and it is a state of perfect equilibrium and absolute happiness.\nThen why are we feeling so sad from time to time?\nBecause we\u2019ve acquired, through our lives, a set of behaviors which have raised a wall between ourselves and our \u201chealthy psychological functioning.\u201d\nNow, the only thing we can do to get back on track is to dig deep beneath these layers and understand the \n of our natural state.\nJust as you can\u2019t really understand light by studying the dark, you\u2019ll never understand happiness by examining the unhealthy psychological functioning of your brain.\nThe starting point?\nDismissing your thoughts.\nChapter 4: Dismissing Thoughts\nIf you realize halfway through a movie that it\u2019s a bad one, you do the most reasonable thing you can: you turn it off; life is just too short to waste it on bad movies.\nWell, the same should be true with your thoughts: so many of them are bad thoughts, and yet, since you firmly believe that they are \n, instead of freeing yourself from them, you let them imprison you in their negativity.\nThe truth is \u2013 you can dismiss any thought you like: you\u2019ve created it, and you have the power to destroy it.\nIt isn\u2019t time which heals all wounds; it is the dismissal of negative thoughts which fade away over time. \nSpeed up the process, and you\u2019ll heal faster. \nOr you may not even get hurt in the first place.\nChapter 5: Wisdom\nYour mind serves you in essentially two different ways: either it is a \u201ccomputer,\u201d or a \u201ctransmitter.\u201d\nThe first way of thinking is memory-based and is called processing; the latter one is insight-based and is the creative, free-flowing mode of your thinking habits.\nNow, the problem is that while knowledge (the ability to solve familiar problems) exists within your processing brain, wisdom lies out of the reach of your processing mind and somewhere deep inside your free-flowing mode of thinking.\nLet\u2019s put it this way: you would never expect from a computer to solve your dating problems, would you?\nWell, apparently, that\u2019s what you do most of the time: you use memory to solve new and unique problems and get stuck within them, thus creating a new thought-related problem:\nWant knowledge? Then use your biological computer.\nWant wisdom? Just turn it off.\nChapter 6: Thoughts Grow with Attention\nRemember \n?\nOf course, you do. \nLet us remind you of Lester Burnham\u2019s final words: \nWe feel that \n movie and \n quote explain the title and the contents of this chapter better than anything.\nAnd are the perfect background for Carlson\u2019s golden rule of happiness: \u201cit\u2019s impossible to feel gratitude for something when you are too busy trying to improve it.\u201d\nChapter 7: Thought Systems\nThe problem why there are so many misunderstandings in this world is quite simple: every single being on this planet thinks differently.\nThese thoughts, in time, create thought systems which you can best imagine as kind of maps of reality; however, just like two people with different maps would never agree as to which is the right direction, people with two different thought systems would never reach a compromise over something.\nIf you want to live a happier life, you need to accept something which is a fact: your thought map is just \nmap of the world and, just like all others, it isn\u2019t a perfect map.\nYour job is to be open-minded and, thus, constantly improve it: not to go around and look for proofs that it is the correct one.\nChapter 8: Choice Points\n\u201cLife can be seen as a continuing series of \u2018choice points,\u2019\u201d writes Richard Carlson. \u201cThe sum of our decisions regarding the direction we take with our choice points will determine, to a very large extent, the way we feel.\u201d\nCarlson defines \u201ca choice point\u201d is \u201can isolated moment in time when you have an opportunity to choose between your healthy functioning (the path of love and contentment) and the path of \u2018thinking it through.\u2019\u201d\nHere\u2019s his chart of what this means in real-world situations:\nEven though sometimes you\u2019ll have no option but to take the Path of Thinking It Through, the key to a happy life is taking the Path of Love as often as possible.\nChapter 9: The Thinking Habit\nTrue, habits are difficult to break, and few are more difficult than the habit of thinking negatively; but \n.\nThinking negatively is \n the wrong choice; because your thoughts govern your feelings and because your feelings are how you experience reality, negative thinking is a surefire way to depression.\nOn average, over 90 percent of the thinking of Carlson\u2019s patients is negative.\nHow does he know this?\nBecause he asks his patients \u2013 as the first step toward recovery \u2013 to start paying attention to their negative thoughts and start writing them down.\nThe result?\nAn awareness of how much they control their own happiness.\nChapter 10: Moods\n\u201cThere has never been, nor will there ever be, a person who doesn\u2019t experience the ups and downs of moods,\u201d writes Richard Carlson. \u201cEven the happiest person isn\u2019t immune to them.\u201d\nSometimes, just a simple shift in your mood is all it takes for the world to suddenly look much brighter than before; unfortunately, this holds true in the opposite case as well.\nAnd no matter how perfect your thinking habits are, your moods are inevitable biological products of the way your body functions.\nThe trick to remaining happy is this: don\u2019t think too much while in a low mood; just like in a broken mirror, everything is distorted and inaccurate then. \nA happy person isn\u2019t a person who doesn\u2019t have ups and downs; a happy person is a person who knows that both of these conditions are temporary.\nChapter 11: Living in the Present Moment\n\u201cPerhaps the oldest and wisest piece of advice for escaping depression and living a happier life,\u201d writes Carlson here and elsewhere, \u201cis to live in the present moment.\u201d\nHowever, even though many would agree that this is great advice, very few adhere to it.\nThe problem is twofold: very few people actually understand their thinking habits and even fewer the power of their own moods.\nBe one of them and start appreciating the Now.\nBecause it is not just a metaphor \n.\nChapter 12: Life Is Like a Pendulum\n\u201cAn excellent way to understand where unhappiness exists in your mind and, more important, how to overcome it,\u201d writes Richard Carlson, \u201cis to study the following chart.\u201d\nThe key to happiness isn\u2019t blindly following the left side above; it is discrediting the right side (your analytical mind) when it is not producing happiness.\nHow would you know when to do this?\nIt\u2019s simple: just follow your feelings.\nChapter 13: Mental Health and the Dynamics of Unhappiness\nYou know how a couple starts acting differently the moment it accepts the fact that it is a couple?\nWell, the same happens to you when you label yourself an unhappy person. \nSuddenly, a trivial event such as the loss of a clock is followed by questions such as \u201cWhy me?\u201d and, even worse, potential joyful events are joined by doubt and anxiety which, in turn, oil the mechanism of the dreaded self-fulfilling prophecy of failure.\nThe only way to counter this is to rip the \u201cunhappy\u201d label as a band-aid and start seeing yourself as you do the people around you.\nNews flash: you are almost certainly not that different from them.\nChapter 14: Grief and Loss\nSometimes, some events are objectively negative; it is inevitable that, at some point in your life, you\u2019ll have to deal with a broken relationship and, at another, even with the loss of a loved one.\nWe don\u2019t need to tell you that grief is normal in these circumstances; however, we do feel the need to point out that it is not normal to become imprisoned \n the thoughts of grief.\nShut down your biological computer and experience the wisdom of the free-flowing thinking mode; your transmitter-brain will always show you the way to the \n.\nChapter 15: Illness and Death\nIn a way, this chapter is a continuation of the previous one.\nYou can\u2019t feel well if you are physically sick, and you certainly cannot feel joy if you need to accept the death of a loved one.\nHowever, utilizing the power of your natural state \u2013 the state of healthy psychological functioning \u2013 is still the best thing you got.\nIt both clears and opens your mind to new possibilities.\nAnd that, in some situations, is enough in itself.\nChapter 16: Many Problems, One Solution\nCarlson describes it thus:\nIn the words of Einstein, \u201cThe solution to a problem will never come about from the same level of understanding that created the problem in the first place.\u201d\nAnd put plainly: \u201cif you can\u2019t solve a problem in a positive state of mind, you will never be able to solve that problem in a lower state of mind.\u201d\nChapter 17: Unhappiness Is Your Curriculum\nRemember the opening sentence of \n: \u201cAll happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\u201d\nCarlson rephrases Tolstoy thus: \u201cEvery person has a curriculum, and every curriculum can be overcome and conquered.\u201d Obviously, unlike Tolstoy, Carlson is a bit more optimistic.\nAnd he thinks he has a reason for this!\nAfter all, he says, no matter what kind of problems you go through, the Holocaust survivors certainly went through much bigger and more unbearable ones.\nAnd yet \u2013 many of them overcame and conquered them.\nWhat\u2019s your excuse?\nChapter 18: The Art of Optimism\n; this is, of course, no accident: \u201cnegative thinking gets us nowhere,\u201d writes Carlson, \u201cexcept perhaps a one-way ticket to the emotional doldrums!\u201d\nOptimism is not something you\u2019re born with \u2013 \n. And it\u2019s not even difficult to do that!\nYou just need to recognize the fact that you are \n your thoughts and that you are force-feeding your feelings with negativity willingly. \nNext, you need to understand that you are just one thought away from a good feeling.\nFinally, you can start thinking positively and, gradually, start changing your feelings as well.\nChapter 19: Happiness and Gratitude\n, Richard Carlson too thinks that gratitude is attitude \u2013 and one which is so powerful that it works as the best \u201cantidote for depression.\u201d\nJust like Lester Burnham (see Chapter 6 above), you need to start feeling gratitude for every single moment of your stupid, little life.\nBecause it\u2019s not stupid.\nAnd because is literally \nyou have.\nKey Lessons from \u201cStop Thinking, Start Living\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There Is a Difference Between the Reality and Your Thoughts and Feelings\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Your Natural State Is the State of Happiness\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Use Your Analytical Brain Less to Be Happier\nThere Is a Difference Between the Reality and Your Thoughts and Feelings\nEven though it may seem strange to you, your thoughts and your feelings are not indicators of the real, objective reality, aka the world as it is; they are just an interpretation of it and nothing more.\nThis is the reason why there are so many misunderstandings and problems in the world: everyone believes that his thoughts and feelings are the only possible interpretation when numerous are true; even though they are mutually exclusive.\nYour Natural State Is the State of Happiness\nYou are born to be happy: your natural state is the state of healthy psychological functioning.\nHowever, throughout life, you spend a lot of time struggling against this notion and believing that, in fact, the opposite is true.\nIf you want to live a happy life, you need to realize that happiness is not something you must attain, but something you only need to retain.\nUse Your Analytical Brain Less to Be Happier\nSpeaking of which: a great way of retaining happiness is letting go of things. \nNamely, if your natural state is the state of healthy psychological functioning, then everything else is waste. \nTo get rid of it, from time to time, feel free to press the off button of your analytical brain; apparently, too much thinking is bad for both your happiness \nyour health.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cStop Thinking, Start Living Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nfeels a bit more personal than Carlson\u2019s other books on the same subjects, but the few examples scattered here and there doesn\u2019t hide the fact that much of it is merely recycled wisdom.\nFeel free to read it if you haven\u2019t read \n and \n.\nOtherwise, you\u2019re good."},

And Why?\nLet us answer these questions with a question: why wouldn\u2019t you read a much-talked-about book by one who is casually deemed one of the most influential intellectuals of our time?\nIf you happen to find an answer to \nquestion which will exempt you from reading \n \u2013 by the way, you know you\u2019re nitpicking, right? \u2013 then here\u2019s another one: wouldn\u2019t you want to read Bill Gates\u2019 favorite book of all time?\nThe book all believers in reason and readers tired of all this negativity around need to read, \nis a thoroughly researched vision of human progress, and, in case you need an injection of optimism, the very next book on your reading list.\nAbout Steven Pinker\n is a Canadian-American award-winning linguist, cognitive psychologist and a renowned popularizer of science. He is widely considered one of the most influential intellectuals in the world today.\nPinker earned his reputation as the author of eight language-related Chomsky-inspired books, the most well-known among these being \n, first published in 1994.\nDuring the last decade, however, he has reached a much wider audience through three popular science books (\n, \n, and this one, \n)\nin which he argues that our future is not that bleak and that, far from being a failed species, humans are actually awesome.\nFind out more at \n.\n\u201cEnlightenment Now PDF Summary\u201d\nA worthy follow-up to \n, \nis a research-based, graph-filled, quotes-adorned apology of Enlightenment values (i.e., reason, science, and humanism), embellished with a firm belief that, unless we stray off this agenda-less path, we are bound to create a better world for all humans.\nAnd you can get this feeling already from the two epigraphs of the book.\nThe first one is by Baruch Spinoza, one of the original Enlighteners, who probably needs no further introduction: \u201cThose who are governed by reason desire nothing for themselves which they do not also desire for the rest of humankind.\u201d\nThe second one is by David Deutsch, a physicist, one of Spinoza\u2019s modern descendants, a guy whose \n we encourage you to see right now: \u201cEverything that is not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge.\u201d\nNow that we got you a bit warmed up, time to move on to our summary proper, dividing it (just like Pinker\u2019s book) into three unequal and unsymmetrical parts.\nPart I: Enlightenment\nPinker\u2019s book starts with a self-quote, embellished, in his own words, \u201cby the distortions of memory and \n\u201d\nIt was his \u201creasonably creditable answer\u201d to \u201cthe most arresting question\u201d he has ever been asked: \u201cWhy should I live?\u201d\nIt\u2019s merely an introduction to his discussion, but, honestly, we firmly believe that it is one of the most quotable parts of an otherwise highly quotable and enlightening book.\nSo, let\u2019s go over it.\n\u201cIn the very act of asking that question,\u201d replied Pinker to his curious student, \u201cyou are seeking reasons for your convictions, and so you are committed to reason as the means to discover and justify what is important to you. And there are so many reasons to live.\u201d\nAnd then he went on:\n\u201cAnd because reason tells you that none of this is particular to you,\u201d Pinker goes on, steering his discussion in the direction of ethics, \u201cyou have the responsibility to provide to others what you expect for yourself.\u201d\nIn other words, \u201cyou can foster the welfare of other sentient beings by enhancing life, health, knowledge, freedom, abundance, safety, beauty, and peace. History shows that when we sympathize with others and apply our ingenuity to improving the human condition, we can make progress in doing so, and you can help to continue that progress.\u201d\nBeautiful.\nJust beautiful.\nIn the first part of his book, Pinker\u2019s outlines the ideas and values of the Enlightenment in three chapters. \nThe first one of these three, \u201cDare to Understand!\u201d is an introduction to these ideas and values; the second one analyzes why they are important; and the third one rallies against all those who question or subvert them, consciously or unintentionally.\n\u201cThe Enlightenment has \n,\u201d writes Pinker, and this is \u201cperhaps the greatest story seldom told.\u201d\nIt is exactly because this triumph is so unsung that \u201cthe underlying ideals of reason, science, and humanism are unappreciated as well.\u201d\n\u201cFar from being an insipid consensus,\u201d Pinker goes on, \u201cthese ideals are treated by today\u2019s intellectuals with indifference, skepticism, and sometimes contempt. When properly appreciated\u2026 the ideals of the Enlightenment are in fact stirring, inspiring, noble\u2014a reason to live.\u201d\nIf you read Pinker\u2019s quote just above this section carefully, you already know that the ideals and values of the Enlightened his book is interested in are reason, science, and humanism.\nIf you are like most people, you probably take them for granted nowadays, which, in a way, doesn\u2019t make you that better than the counter-enlighteners.\nBecause, you see, though they have prehistory, reason, science, and humanism are actually pretty new additions to the wide-ranging spectrum of human achievements.\nYou can trace them back to the second half of the 18\n century when, according to Immanuel Kant\u2019s 1784 essay \u201c\n,\u201d humankind emerged from \u201cits self-incurred immaturity,\u201d its \u201clazy and cowardly\u201d submission to the \u201cdogmas and formulas\u201d of religious or political authority.\nThe Enlightenment\u2019s motto?\n, dare to understand!\nIts values and ideals?\n\u2022 \n: the idea that some things in this world are facts and are, thus, non-negotiable; in other words, some things are true regardless of what the so-called religious or political authorities say;\n\u2022 \n: structured reasoning; the idea that we can both discover some facts about our existence though experiments and pass them on to future generations as proven;\n\u2022 \nthe\nidea that all of us are in this thing together and the revelation that tribalism and random groupings are as primitive as voodoo-magic.\nIf you don\u2019t understand what the title above means, don\u2019t worry \u2013 it\u2019s just a fancy Pinkerian way of saying \u201centropy, evolution, information.\u201d\nWhy the three?\nWell, first of all, because, whether we wanted or not, we are all necessary victims of \n \u2013 the Second Law of Thermodynamic.\nAccording to its most famous formulation, the entropy of an isolated system never decreases, i.e., a closed system inevitably becomes less structured until it slides \u201cinto an equilibrium of gray, tepid, homogeneous monotony and [stays] there.\u201d\nBut how is entropy relevant to human affairs?\nWell, many people nowadays (aka, the Counter-Enlightenments) believe that humanity is not an exception.\nThings go from bad to worse day in day out, and one day we too should experience the inevitable end and become a monotonous grey equilibrium of failures.\nPinker begs to differ.\nStats seem to show otherwise: we seem to \nand it\u2019s time we admit that things are getting better all the time.\nAnd why is that?\nWell, for one, because we are not an isolated, closed system: ever since the Enlightenment, we are an outrageously huge, smart, and interconnected organism justly called Humanity.\nAnd if we want to continue evolving, we need to commit even stronger to these ideals?\nWant a proof?\nWell, \n yourself.\nBecause, if you are factful, \n.\nOf course, many people say that Pinker and people who are optimistic about this stuff are just plain wrong.\nAfter all, stats are correct only until subverted by the \n or the \n, i.e., the things not taken into consideration because of their rarity, but also the things which tend to have such a devastating effect that they\nThink what \n or \n might mean for Pinker\u2019s arguments in the long run?\nPinker acknowledges that the impact of the highly unpredictable should not be waved away, but, still, he demonstrates that, these spikes of bad things aside (colonialism, World Wars, Chernobyl, etc.), humanity is obviously getting better and better.\nAnd all those right-wing nationalists or leftist rebels-without-causes would do much better for their own wellbeing (and the wellbeing of everybody) if they just listen to what reason and the data has to say.\nPart II: Progress\nAnd this is the reason\u2019s gospel:\nOf course, these are Barack Obama\u2019s (and not Pinker\u2019s) words, but either way, they make Pinker\u2019s point clear: we\u2019ve progressed a lot, and people should just stop being progressophobs (theirs is Chapter 4) and rejoice instead.\nAnd here\u2019s the data.\nNot that it\u2019s new information, but conspirators of future dystopias and counter-Enlighteners seem to enjoy ignoring this: people are nowadays living longer than ever:\nBefore the Enlightenment, as you can see from Pinker\u2019s graph, an average person couldn\u2019t expect to live more than 35 years \u2013 even in Europe.\nNowadays, the average life expectancy in Europe is over 80!\nThe best news:\nThis trend is worldwide.\nMeaning, even in Africa, people are nowadays living far longer than they did a century ago!\nOf course \u2013 and this goes to all the anti-vaxxers out there! \u2013 we owe this to many creative and smart members of our species who discovered various \n sources of diseases and finally substituted prayers, sacrifices, and homeopathy with actual cures, thus saving \n of lives.\nHere are just a few of them:\nAnd there are more!\nJohn Snow was the first epidemiologist, the man who started it all; Karl Landsteiner discovered blood groups; Ignaz Semmelweis and Joseph Lister first introduced equipment- and hand-sterilization into medical practice; and Jonas Salk \u2013 well, he discovered the vaccine against polio.\nAnd this is how that day looked like in the States:\n\u201cPeople observed moments of silence, rang bells, honked horns, blew factory whistles, fired salutes\u2026 took the rest of the day off, closed their schools or convoked fervid assemblies therein, drank toasts, hugged children, attended church, smiled at strangers, and forgave enemies.\u201d\nYou know why?\nBecause millions were saved.\nBut what about the poor and the hungry, you ask?\nWell, they are better as well.\nbetter:\nJust a simple comparison:\nA century and a half ago, Swedish children were starving to death during the winters; nowadays, it is basically impossible for someone living in Sweden to die.\nWe didn\u2019t forget the poor.\nAnd we know that it is all but a fact that 99% of the world\u2019s wealth is owned by 1% of the people.\nHowever, Pinker says, it is also a fact that most of the other 99% aren\u2019t doing that bad themselves, \n.\nJust two centuries ago, about nine-tenths of the world were living in extreme poverty, and nowadays, countries such as Vietnam, Rwanda and El Salvador (to say nothing of the G8 or economic miracles such as South Korea or Singapore) are doubling their income ever two decades!\nThe rich are indeed getting richer; but (and this should be shouted out loud as well) \n are the poor.\nNow, of course, with that much wealth, inequality is all but expected.\nHowever, according to some of our most renowned economists, inequality \nlevel itself out in the long run.\nThe first name that Pinker throws in the discussion is that of Simon Kuznets, whose hypothetic U-shaped curve argued that as money multiply, inequality rises, but, in time, market forces decrease it.\nThere are many factors which contribute to this, one of which is something called the Adolph Wagner\u2019s law, according to which the wealthier a country gets, the smarter and more active its people become, resulting in political pressure for that country to spend money on social and welfare programs.\nWe have to note that, in our view, this chapter is by far the least correct in Pinker\u2019s book. \nNot only he dismisses \u2013 by the way faultily, mixing absolute and relative wealth \u2013 Piketty\u2019s \n\u2013 which has all but demonstrated that Kuznets is wrong and that inequality is raging \u2013 but he also interprets much of the data in a rather unscientific manner, to suit his argument.\nAnd this \nthe fact that he acknowledges that he can\u2019t pretend here that all the trends are positive.\nSpeaking of a domain where humanity can fail its host, the Earth \u2013 here is how things stand with regard to our relation to the environment:\nStrangely enough, capitalist progress hasn\u2019t resulted in an environmental horror, nor the data suggest that more care for the environment should hinder it.\n\u201cThese diverging curves,\u201d writes Pinker commenting the graph above, \u201crefute both the orthodox Green claim that only degrowth can curb pollution and the orthodox right-wing claim that environmental protection must sabotage economic growth and people\u2019s standard of living.\u201d\nIt seems plainly wrong, at a day and age when we hear about violent deaths on a daily basis, to argue that the Earth is now safer and more peaceful than ever.\nAnd yet, the data shows that this is true:\nMore people are nowadays \n, and there are far fewer wars and homicides (the United States being, unfortunately, the only highly developed country where the latter are a problem). \nAlso, the world is a far safer place to live in today than fifty and hundred years ago \u2013 in just about any category: work-related deaths, plane crashes, vehicle accidents, drownings, fires \u2013 and even falls!\nDuring the fascist uprisings of the 1920s, there were only 12 democratic nations in the world.\nAs of 2015 \u2013 there are 103!\nSome may say that democracy is overrated, but it is not: it is the best idea the enlightened minds of the 18\n century devised as a way to fight against autocracy and leadership breakdowns.\nThink of it this way \u2013 as bad as it is, democratic nations almost never experience bloody revolutions because you can always vote for another Party four years later.\nOf course, the more democratic a country is, the more equal the rights of its citizens. \nChina may be the second most powerful country in the world, but as far as regular humans are concerned, they\u2019d probably choose to live in South Korea, because their rights are much more protected there:\nAnd as history has proven, knowledge and education evolve far better in democratic countries, and, during the past century or so, this has all but annihilated sexism and racism.\nTrue, they are still there, but bear this in mind: with the exception of Vatican, women can vote everywhere nowadays, something which was unimaginable just a hundred years ago even in the most developed societies!\nBack to terrorism, unhappiness and other existential threats.\nAs you can only suppose by now, Pinker is not that bothered by them.\nAnd, to cut the long story short, you shouldn\u2019t be either \u2013 and for a very simple reason: the graphs above.\nAfter all, if you\u2019re more likely to die due to a bee sting or a suicide than a terrorist attack, then why all this dread?\nThe days when nuclear wars seemed possible are long gone. The world is much wealthier, healthier, and safer. There are two superpowers (China and the USA), but they are not nearly as antagonistic to each other as the USSR and the USA.\nIronically, you feel so much dread and anxiety \n because you\u2019re living at the best time of history. Your education and knowledge make you wonder about things your predecessors \ndid.\nFight this dread with \nknowledge \u2013 because the data is on your side!\nPart III: Reason, Science, and Humanism\nAfter outlining the ideas of the Enlightenment in the first part and demonstrating that they actually work in the second, Pinker wraps up his defense of the Enlightenment in the short, concluding third part of his book.\nHere he tries to defend science against the attacks of all those Luddites who blame everything from eugenics through racism to Nazism on the ideals of the Enlightenment.\nHowever, Pinker confidently shows that the idea of the Aryan race was devised by a fiction writer (damn you, Arthur de Gobineau, damn you to hell!), that proponents of eugenics are rarely for sterilizing \u201cunfit\u201d people and always for incentivizing talented people to procreate, and that climate change is real and not a Chinese conspiracy.\nDonald Trump, Pinker\u2019s looking at you!\nAnd he thinks that you are an outlier, a statistical mistake. The educated didn\u2019t vote for you, just as they didn\u2019t vote for Brexit. \nAnd just as they will never vote for autocratic, religious, tyrannical governments which oppress human freedom and believe in things eighth-graders know to be wrong nowadays.\nKey Lessons from \u201cEnlightenment Now\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Enlightenment Believed in Reason, Science, and Humanism\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The World Is Getting Better\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Counter-Enlighteners Are Outliers\nThe Enlightenment Believed in Reason, Science, and Humanism\nBefore the second half of the 18\n century, the world was much bleaker than the world of today.\nThe reason?\nThere were no facts, and people in positions of power could use their influence to fabricate reality.\nHowever, then a group of scientific-minded philosophers decided that we must restructure our world; and so, they did, rebuilding it upon the foundations of reason, science, and humanism.\nThe result?\nThe world of today, better than ever.\nThe World Is Getting Better\nRegardless of whether we\u2019re talking about life and health, or wealth, inequality and sustenance \u2013 people are nowadays better off than they were before the Enlightenment.\nThe same holds true with regard to safety and democracy, to equal rights and education, and even with regard to happiness.\nIn one sentence, the world is \u2013 \n and \n \u2013 getting better.\nSo, stop moaning!\nCounter-Enlighteners Are Outliers\nSpeaking of moaning, there are quite a few important people nowadays who believe in unscientific things (anti-vaxxers, racists, hardcore environmentalists, alt-rightists, far leftists, religious people, etc.)\nThe bad news: there always will be.\nThe good news: they are fewer and fewer.\nAnd even though it may seem that nationalism and racism are on the rise, they are not; in a few years, Trump, Erdogan, Putin, Orban, Le Pen \u2013 they shall all pass, and the world will go on marching forward.\nThe way it has for the past two centuries.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cEnlightenment Now Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nmade the headlines even before reaching the shelves since, a month before its scheduled publication, Bill Gates dubbed it his \u201cnew favorite book\u201d in a January 2018 tweet.\nMost of the critics agree with Gates\u2019 praise: \u201cIn an era of increasingly \u2018dystopian rhetoric,\u2019\u201d wrote a \n review, \u201cPinker\u2019s sober, lucid, and meticulously researched vision of human progress is heartening and important.\u201d\n\u201cBarring a cataclysmic asteroid strike or nuclear war,\u201d added \n, practically summarizing Pinker\u2019s main point, \u201cit is likely that (the world) will continue to get better.\u201d\nAnd we kind of feel the same. \nWe know that another favorite author of us, \n, would seriously \n, but we guess we\u2019re not smart enough to disagree with either one of these two.\nAnd we firmly believe that you\u2019ll lose nothing getting familiar with both Pinker\u2019s and Taleb\u2019s arguments."},

V. S. stands for in Laxman\u2019s name:\nVery Very Special Laxman, of course.\nWell, here\u2019s his autobiography:\n.\nWho Should Read \u201c281 and Beyond\u201d? And Why?\nThe easiest \u2013 and, perhaps, best, answer to the first question is: the one who knows who V. V. S. Laxman is.\nIn that case, we don\u2019t even need to tell you why you should read this book: you already know it yourself.\nHowever, if you don\u2019t know Laxman, then we suppose this is not a book for you. Even if you watch cricket \u2013 because, well, what kind of a cricket fan is one who doesn\u2019t know who Laxman is?\nAbout V. V. S. Laxman\n \u2013 short for Vangipurapu Venkata Sai Laxman \u2013 is a former Indian cricketer.\nAn aggressive right-hand batsman, Laxman is widely considered one of the best cricket players of the 2000s, despite never being selected for a Cricket World Cup. In fact, Laxman is one of the very few players to have played 100 Tests without going to the World Cup.\nLaxman\u2019s knock of 281 against Australia in 2001 is often considered the greatest test inning in history.\nHis autobiography, \n, was co-written with R. Kaushik, a veteran and respected cricket writer.\n\u201c281 and Beyond PDF Summary\u201d\nCo-authored by R. Kaushik, \n is the autobiography of V. V. S. Laxman, one of the greatest cricketers of, arguably, India\u2019s greatest cricket generation.\nThe Story of 281\nSome numbers just stick to the athletes associated with them. \nThink of 23, and there\u2019s no way you think of anyone else but Michael Jordan and maybe LeBron James. Think of Wilt Chamberlain, and the number 100 comes to mind. Barry Bonds is all about 73, and Eric Dickerson about 2,105.\nMore relevantly, it\u2019s difficult to think of Anil Kumble without thinking about his Perfect 10 against Pakistan in 1999, or of Sunil Gavaskar without harking back to 1983 and his unbeaten 236 against the West Indies.\nWell, the number 281 is reserved for V. V. S. Laxman.\nTaking into consideration the fact that it occurred against the Aussies in an all but lost position, and was, consequently, deemed by Cricket Monthly \u201c\n,\u201d chances are, as long as men play and watch cricket, 281 will forever be the number of V. V. S. Laxman.\nVery Very Special Laxman.\nOK \u2013 we admit we don\u2019t know that much about cricket, but even we could guess how V. V. S. Laxman\u2019s biography would \u2013 and, actually, \n \u2013 start.\nRecalled to the national team at the beginning of 2000, V. V. S. Laxman was one of the very few bright spots for India during the disastrous Australian tour of that year (they say that India\u2019s batsmen had quite a few nightmares of Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne during that year). \nIn fact, while all the batsmen struggled to cope with McGrath, Laxman scored 167 in the third (and final) Test match in Sidney.\nHowever, and somewhat surprisingly, Laxman decided to return to domestic cricket afterward, thinking that the role of opener didn\u2019t suit him.\nThe result?\nAfter being let go from the Test team in 1999 due to poor results, Laxman was once again dropped for almost the entirety of 2000. In fact, he barely found a spot in the team at the end of the year, just in time for the home series against Australia.\nIt is not that known \u2013 although it can be surmised by the fact that Laxman\u2019s spine required straightening during his epic performance \u2013 but Laxman was close to not even playing the 2001 Test at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. \nA slipped disc had nearly benched him, so he requested all the help he could get from the physio, Andrew Leipus.\n\u201cI said,\u201d Laxman recalls, \u201c\u2018Tell me you can fix this Andrew.\u2019 There was a salty taste in my mouth. I didn\u2019t even realize I had started to cry. Perhaps it was the sight of a grown man weeping that did the trick.\u201d\nIn retrospect, it\u2019s safe to say it did a lot more than that.\n\u201cTo call Eden Gardens my theatre of dreams is an understatement,\u201d writes V. V. S. Laxman in \n. \u201cIt provided the canvas for the picture I wanted to paint, for the dreams I wanted to realize. Dreams that had taken shape a long, long ago, when the cricket bug bit me.\u201d\nBut let\u2019s set the scene first.\nIn the first Test at Mumbai, India\u2019s entire batting line-up (well, all except for Tendulkar) capitulated before the Aussies handing their bitter rivals their \n Test win.\nAnd the second match at Kolkata didn\u2019t seem any different \u2013 that is until the second evening when V. V. S. Laxman came to bat:\nBased on what followed, that has to be one of the greatest understatements in the history of cricket. Though playing against the best attack in the world \u2013 on a team 222 runs behind \u2013 Laxman produced an extraordinary knock of 281!\nRahul Dravid\u2019s stellar supporting role \u2013 the two paired up for record 376 \u2013 meant that India survived the fourth day of the Test.\nOn the wings of Laxman\u2019s career-defining performance, his team rose from the ashes to eventually win not just the Test, but the series.\n\u201cAs I played that wonderful inning of 281,\u201d notes Laxman, \u201cAdam Gilchrist said a few times \u2018it\u2019s like the Don is batting.\u2019\u201d\nIndeed, it was.\nOn Becoming V. V. S.\nAnd to think that Laxman might have never become V. V. S!\nBorn in Hyderabad to noted physicians Dr. Satyabhama and Dr. Shantaram \u2013 and, thus, the great-great nephew of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, India\u2019s second president \u2013 it was only natural for Laxman to toy with the idea of becoming a doctor himself. \n\u201cAt 17,\u201d writes Laxman, \u201cI had to pick between cricket and medicine.\u201d If the interest in the latter came via his parents, the love for the former Laxman owes to Mohammad Azharuddin\u2019s feats against England. \u201cWatching him rip England to shreds with a great 182 was nearly a personal success for me,\u201d writes V. V. S.\nFortunately, Laxman\u2019s uncle, Baba Krishna Mohan, backed his love and not his interest, firmly believing that V. V. S. \u00a0is talented enough to play for India; that sealed it. \nHowever, there was a condition: Laxman was given five years to make this dream come true; otherwise, it was back to medicine.\nV. V. S. took this \u201cif\u201d quite seriously and spent the next five years living a life framed within 3Ds: discipline, determination, and dedication.\nIt was all cricket for him during those five years: no movies, no evening outings with friends, nothing. He even enrolled in college just so that he could play cricket, \u201cnot to study.\u201d\nThe result?\nLaxman debuted for India\u2019s U-19 team against Australia in February 1994; he ended the series as the leading run-scorer. It was evident that a new star was in the making. \nUnfortunately, in his early years, Laxman had to accept the opener\u2019s position \u2013 one he never enjoyed \u2013 much more often than he wanted. \nAfter a while, he decided to never again play as an opener. This cost him his place at the national team for a while; in the end, it all worked out.\nOn the Great Ones\nUnsurprisingly, \nincludes quite a few honest portraits of some of the greatest Indian cricketers to ever grace the willow game.\nYou can find more than a few paragraphs here on everybody, predominantly focused on the God of the Game, Sachin Tendulkar, the destructive batsman Virender Sehwag, and the long-time captains, Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly.\nCommenting on Dravid\u2019s captaincy, Laxman says that Rahul, always systematic and meticulous, was even more intense as a skipper than as a batsman. \u201cHe took everyone\u2019s failures to heart,\u201d he writes, even feeling that the captaincy is not a responsibility, but a burden. That\u2019s why he relinquished the captaincy.\nThe same holds true for Sourav, who, feeling that cricket is more than just a game, constantly insisted on both team and individual effort, being okay with a defeat if his team gave its best and lost. However, he too felt the weight of the captaincy and, after being stripped of it, he came back to the team as a different man.\nAs for Sehwag\u2019s philosophy of the game \u2013 he was, more or less, a firm believer that a game is won or lost even before beginning. Therefore, he constantly put pressure on the bowlers, playing with their minds throughout the game, and coming on top more often than not.\nFinally, Tendulkar. Well, you don\u2019t need V. V. S. to tell you that excellence was always floating in his mind. \u201cWhen he put on the India colors,\u201d he notes, Sachin \u201cgrew ten feet tall.\u201d\nOn Greg Chappell\nIn May 2005, Greg Chappell, the pre-eminent Australian batsman of the 1970s, was appointed coach of the Indian national cricket team for a two-year term.\n\u201cI had been a huge fan of Chappell for a long time,\u201d writes Laxman. \u201cWhen he was appointed our coach, I was both happy and excited.\u201d\nThis happiness wouldn\u2019t last long: unfortunately, Greg was as bad at coaching as he was good at playing. \u201cBrusque and abrasive, highly opinionated and rigid in his thinking,\u201d Chappell, according to V. V. S. Laxman, had no man-management skills and \u201cquickly sowed further seeds of discontent in an already diffident team:\u201d\nOften forgetful of the fact that it is the players who play the game and not the coach, Chappell apparently had favorites and looked after them more than well; the others were \u201cleft to fend for themselves.\u201d\nThe result?\nThe team was disintegrating before Laxman\u2019s very eyes.\nLaxman\u2019s verdict?\nOn His Early Retirement\nLaxman was always deemed as a \u201csincere\u201d and \u201cever-smiling\u201d person; that\u2019s why he was as loved and respected in the dressing room as he was by his fans on the stadium or in front of the TV. \nIt was this love (from the fans, from the teammates, from his family, and especially his wife Sailaja) that got Laxman through some \u201cdark days\u201d of his career, especially his first thoughts about retirement when not being picked up for the 2003 World Cup and the time under Chappell.\nAnd, then, a few years later, on August 18, 2012, Laxman suddenly announced his retirement, just a few days before a Test match against New Zealand in his hometown of Hyderabad.\nOf course, this set off a wave of speculations \u2013 many conjectured that Laxman\u2019s retirement was due to his differences with M. S. Dhoni \u2013 resulting in \u201cthe first and only controversy of [Laxman\u2019s] cricketing career.\u201d\nThe truth is \u2013 explains now Laxman \u2013 he has nothing but respect for Dhoni, and that he didn\u2019t retire because of him or any other extraneous forces: he did it because of his \u201cinner voice.\u201d\n\u201cAll my life, my actions had been dictated by this voice,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut in conjunction with suggestions from those closest to me. This time, with greater maturity, I had gone entirely by it, disregarding advice from even my father.\u201d\nAnd his father wasn\u2019t the only one to advise against the sudden retirement: Sachin tried to convince Laxman to postpone the press conference too. It was one of the few times he disregarded Tendulkar\u2019s advice: \u201cI told him repeatedly\u2026 that my mind was made up.\u201d\n\u201cIt was not the fairy-tale ending that cricketers dream of, but to me, it was a fairy-tale ending nonetheless because I had stepped down on my own terms,\u201d he concludes.\nKey Lessons from \u201c281 and Beyond\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Choose What Your Best At \u2013 and Go for It\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There\u2019s Always Such Thing as a Second Chance (Even in Cricket)\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Handling Success Is as Difficult as Handling Failure\nChoose What Your Best At \u2013 and Go for It\nDespite repeatedly being chosen for the opener\u2019s slot, V. V. S. Laxman didn\u2019t feel comfortable at that position. \nAnd to make his stand loud and clear, back in 2000, he decided that he wasn\u2019t going to play on that position anymore, whatever the cost.\nFor a while, this meant that he wasn\u2019t going to play for India\u2019s national team; but then, he returned \u2013 and the 281 happened.\nIn other words \u2013 focus on what you\u2019re good at; and strive to become the best.\nThere\u2019s Always Such Thing as a Second Chance (Even in Cricket)\nWhen V. V. S. exploded with a 281 against the Australians back in 2001, the Aussies were on course to win their 17\n consecutive Test match against India.\nNeedless to add, V. V. S. was under tremendous pressure, and he delivered.\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t missed out on 300 by 19 runs,\u201d he writes, \u201cI had made 281 in a crisis with our backs to the wall, and for the team.\u201d\nDescribing the performance as \u201cuncontroversial\u2026 sublime,\u201d \n wrote that Laxman, that few evenings \u201cproved that there are second chances in Test cricket.\u201d\nThere are also in life \u2013 even when everything seems lost and gone.\nHandling Success Is as Difficult as Handling Failure\n\u201cIt is tougher to handle success than failure,\u201d writes Laxman honestly. \u201cIn India, if you are successful, you get carried away very easily. If you are going through a bad patch, you get support, and you work hard to bounce back. That\u2019s why having a support system is crucial in such a situation.\u201d\n\u201cWe are not taught how to handle success,\u201d he goes on. \u201cI have seen a lot of talented players, who unfortunately do not have the support system, soon drift away. That not only happens because of how they are dealing with failure but also the success.\u201d\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201c281 and Beyond Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nThough sports biographies tend to disappoint from time to time, \nis not one of these cases.\nIt is interesting and nicely written, and it covers almost everything you\u2019d expect, shedding some light over Laxman\u2019s retirement, his relationship with Greg Chappell, and his thoughts on his teammates.\nOf course, as the title suggests, there\u2019s a whole chapter about \nknock of 281; it\u2019s the first one and, by the end of it, the book pays back its price.\nA must for cricket fans."},

Are you an entrepreneur or maybe you have an idea/a small business which you want to transform into a BIG idea/GREAT company?\nIf the answer is \u201cYES\u201d for at least one question from above, then \u201cThe 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing\u201d is one of the first books you MUST read and take notes!\n\u201c\ng\u201d, written by \n and \n, offers you a complete guide.\u00a0We can even call it \n, concisely structured (in 22 short chapters) and very easy to read.\nReading this book will help you focus on the really important issues, like the following: to choose the best decisions, to better invest your budget and to avoid mistakes, waste of time and money.\n\u201cThe 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing Summary\u201d\nThe book presents the basic and constant rules which \n and the failure of companies or products/services in the retail market.\nEven if the book was published more than 20 years ago, the laws and the advice presented are still up to date as marketing and the consumers didn\u2019t change (too much).\nThe book was written after more than 25 years of studying what works and what doesn\u2019t work in marketing.\nEach marketing law or affirmation presented within the book is accompanied by clear and real examples from the history of famous brands (such as IBM, Coca-Cola, Xerox, Starbucks, etc.) versus examples of companies that don\u2019t exist anymore on the market.\nAccording to the authors Al Ries and Jack Trout some companies have progressed and have become increasingly popular, have expanded the business lines or just increased their sales for a specific range because their \n discovered and respected the marketing laws presented in the book.\nUnfortunately, there were (or still are) other companies that stagnated their business or even went bankrupt because they didn\u2019t take into consideration the same marketing \n.\n#1: The Law of Leadership\nBeing the first in a market is better than having a better product than the competition.\nPeople tend to remember who was the first man on the moon or the first aviator, but no one remembers who was the second.\nHeineken was the first imported beer in the \n and continues today to be number 1.\nThe same goes for Miller, the first light beer on the American market. By the way, being first does not help if the product or idea is not good.\n#2: The Law of Category\nGiven the difficulty of leading a category whose competition already exists, it is better to create a new category of products and position your product in it.\nThe category does not have to be brutally different, \n in the current category, create a variation where you can be unique.\nIn the example of the \u201cimported beers\u201d category, Heineken can be a leader, but you can be a leader in the \u201clight imported beers\u201d category, for example.\nYou may not be the first man to step on the moon, but you may be the first woman to step on the moon.\n#3: The Law of the Mind\nMore important than being number 1 on the market, is being number 1 in the minds of consumers.\nBeing the pioneer of a market helps, after all, there is no competition for the minds of consumers. But, since the consumer is predisposed to a brand, it is very difficult to change it.\nTo be successful without spending \n, your goal is to find as many minds as possible yet without a formed opinion and work hard to form them.\n#4: The Law of Perception\nMarketing is not about products, their features, and their qualities but about people\u2019s perceptions about that product.\nThere is no truth, and what we call truth is a perception that people create in their minds. In Japan, the biggest automaker is Honda, but in the US market, it is only in third place, behind Toyota and Nissan.\nIf the quality of a car is the most important to the consumer, the leader should be the same in both markets.\nThe curious point is that in Japan, \n. Therefore, the focus of marketing should always be directed at changing perceptions.\n#5: The Law of Focus\nThe most powerful thing that exists in marketing is to own a word in the consumer\u2019s mind.\nHolding a specific context ensures that when people are exposed to this word, they connect it with the brand that owns the word. Shaving blades are synonymous with Gillette.\nComputers are synonymous with IBM and Google means researching something.\n#6: The Law of Exclusivity\nComplementing the law of focus, it is impossible to take the word of another company.\nBurger King tried to own the word \u201cfast\u201d but it was already McDonald\u2019s, and so they failed and spent millions.\nIf a competitor already owns a phrase or word, do not try to use it but find something different and unique.\nIf you try to steal the phrase or word of your rival, your marketing efforts end up strengthening \n.\n#7: The Law of the Ladder\nImagine the market as a ladder inside the consumer\u2019s head. The first step is the market leader; the second is the second placed and so on.\nYour marketing strategy depends on the step you take on the market ladder. In some product categories, the ladder may have seven rungs, and you need to know it to build your strategy. An efficient approach realistically matches your current position \n.\nThe American company Avis was the number two in the rental market vehicles and as announced with the slogan \u201cthe best in car rentals,\u201d they were losing money because people did not believe in the campaign.\nThey now have greater profits when they took their second position and adopted the slogan \u201cWe try harder\u201d, which characterized them in a manner befitting their position.\n#8: The Law of Duality\nIn the long run, all marketing battles become about with only two competitors. Think McDonalds & Burger King. Nike & Reebok.\nThere will always be two brands struggling to win a category.\nCompanies that do not \n should strive to establish themselves as the number 2 if they want to be successful in the long run.\n#9: The Law of the Opposite\nIf you fight for second place, your strategy is set by the leader. Turn your strengths into weaknesses.\nDo not try to be better and chase the opposite of him. \n, Pepsi decides to take off being \u201cThe choice of the new generation\u201d.\nIn this way, you steal the attention of other competitors, after all, most people tend to fall between \u201cthe old trusted brand\u201d and the \u201cnew brand that has arrived.\u201d\n#10: The Law of the Division\nOver time, most categories fall into many segments, and each begins to act as an independent category.\nCars started as a single category, and today there are sports cars, luxury cars, utilities, etc.\nOften companies do not understand this and believe that divisions are combining, \n.\nLeading brands maintain their dominance by attacking new categories with new brands. When Honda tried to hit the luxury market, for example, it created a new brand, Acura.\n#11: The Law of Perspective\nMarketing results can only be appreciated in the long run. It is a mistake to sacrifice long-term planning to improve short-term outcomes.\nRaising sales in the short term through the use of rebates can be positive for the company cashier, but educates consumers to buy when deals occur, and this reduces profits in the long run.\n#12: The Law of Line Extension\nCompanies tend to give in to the temptation \n.\nWhen this happens, the company ends up losing its focus and failing, as it starts to try to be everything to everyone, instead of focusing on what it knows how to do. In marketing, more is less.\nThe more products a company has, the lower the profits for each one.\nAnd also less is more: the smaller the niche a brand wants to occupy, the higher its position in the minds of consumers within that focal area.\n#13: The Law of Sacrifice\nYou need to focus on conquering something important. Companies that try to do everything end up failing. To progress, a company should not:\nIf a company is not prepared to make such sacrifices, it will never win.\n#14: The Law of Attributes\nFor each attribute used in marketing by one company, there is an opposite attribute that the other can use effectively.\nThe reason for this tactic is obvious. It is challenging to win by replacing market leaders; So you should focus on serving any segment of the market that the leader ignores.\nIn this segment, there will always be enough space.\n#15: The Law of Candor\nAdmit something wrong in your marketing and consumers will accept it positively.\nThat works by being unexpected and opens up the audience to your message.\nSmart companies admit marketing failures and then \n.\nThe prospect should feel instantly in agreement with your apology. Otherwise, you will cause confusion.\n#16: The Law of Singularity\nIn every marketing situation, there is always a movement that will bring substantial success.\nTuning an inefficient strategy does not return results. Working a little harder in executing an inefficient tactic does not produce results.\nIn almost every situation, there is an option that will bring excellent results. The challenge is to find this option and explore it. Competitors will have a weakness.\n#17: The Law of Unpredictability\nTrying to anticipate the plans of the competition is impossible, and their reaction can never be anticipated. Study general trends, but avoid drawing unfounded conclusions or overstating the facts.\nYou should also avoid betting that the future will be a repetition of the past. Just plan what to do should something unexpected happen and make your plans flexible to respond to market dynamics.\n#18: The Law of Success\nSuccess leads to arrogance, which leads to failure. Success tends to take objectivity away from marketers.\nYou have to be careful to avoid early success and failure in the future. Good specialists \n and do not impose their point of view on others, but try to put themselves in the shoes of their clients.\nGood people think and react the way the consumer would do when faced with an offer from their brand.\nAn interesting example is when Ken Olsen, a successful executive at DEC, was introduced to personal computing.\nHis success prevented him from seeing potential in that product, and DEC never participated in the personal computing revolution.\n#19: The Law of Failure\nFailure in marketing should be expected and accepted. In marketing, it is better to admit mistakes on time instead of letting the situation continue indefinitely.\nNo one in marketing will ever get it right.\nAn interesting example: once the mouthwash Listerine was attacked by the competitor called Scope.\nThey claimed in the campaign that the taste of Listerine was terrible and theirs was better.\nListerine answered the pitch, with the campaign \u201cThe taste you hate, 2 times a day\u201d. That has caused consumers to consume more Listerine, and the company has won.\n#20: The Law of Hype\n is often the opposite of what is reported in the press.\nWhen sales are weak, companies give interviews and say they are OK. When they are strong, companies are silent.\nDo not believe in articles generated by press services and pay attention to the small hidden details of what is happening in the market.\nThere is a big difference between attracting public attention and revolutionizing the market.\nSome of the greatest hits in history, such as PC and fax, \n in the beginning and attracted little press coverage, and some of the more exaggerated concepts, such as the videophone and the Segway, failed.\n#21: The Law of Acceleration\nSuccessful marketing plans follow trends, do not follow fads. Fads are short-term occurrences and trends are long-term changes. When a company accelerates too much and starts working with fads, it fails.\n#22: The Law of Resources\nGood ideas did not take off without the proper resources.\nEven the best professional in the world will not get very far if they do not have the resources to reach out to the client.\nYou need to invest money to get there and even more, money \n.\nThe authors of the book, \n are two professional marketing strategists, considered to be among the best and most known at the international level.\nThey worked together and have written, together but also separately, few other useful books worth reading regarding marketing, positioning, branding.\nGetNugget plays its part by introducing the readers to this magnificent masterpiece. Our book summary will help you see the big picture of this book.\nThe classic act as a specific guide suitable not only for the renowned companies who want to expand on a global scale but also for startups.\n\u201cThe 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing\u201d endorses the theory that every brand should spend more of its time and energy on marketing activities and avoid getting into dangerous battles with competitors.\nAl Ries is also the co-founder and chairman of the Atlanta-based consulting firm Ries & Ries, where he works together with his partner and daughter, Laura Ries while Jack Trout is one of the founders of positioning theory and also marketing warfare theory.\n\u201cThe 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing Summary\u201d \n which are of high importance:\nWhen you\u2019re a potential customer, you remember which company launched firstly a product and you associate the product with the company.\nOf course, not all the time the first products are the best ones and you will search the market for alternatives only if you\u2019re from the category of those \u2018few people\u2019 who are looking for quality, who want to test a new product in order to do a comparison and then decide whose product you\u2019ll remain a loyal customer.\nThere are marketers and managers who think that marketing is about products.\nActually, \n.\nFurther on, depending on the type of perceptions the products and the companies created in people\u2019s mind, these ones are going to decide who is winning the battle.\nThis quote refers to the Law of Focus, a law that applies all the time in all areas.\nAs a company, you have to FOCUS: on how perceptions are formed, to focus on being first in the customer\u00b4s mind, to focus on facts and reality, to focus on your efforts.\n. Focusing doesn\u2019t mean to choose the most complicated ways of looking for too complex words to describe you, words that will not be remembered and the goal will not be achieved.\nYou have to find simple words that describe your company, your product, your business generally and when you find those words you have to protect them, to prove they are real in order to benefit from them and when those words are no longer useful, you must change the words.\nThe Law of Sacrifice applies not only in business, therefore If you want to be successful today, you should give something up.\nActually, The Law of Resources is more complex as there are several aspects to be considered: In order to promote an idea you have to be prepared to give away a lot for the funding, but at the same time \u2013 You have to use your idea to find the money, not the marketing help.\nAlso, not all ideas/products need a lot of money [A technical or business product has to raise less marketing money because the prospect list is shorter and media is less expensive.] Probably the best recipe/solution would be: [1. First get the idea, 2. then go get the money to exploit it.]\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind these 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing together with the authors\u2019 examples, comparisons, and advice. For every law, Al Ries and Jack Trout present various short case studies that can be used as models for both situations:\n\u2013 When the used strategy has revealed the best results;\n\u2013 When the used strategy didn\u2019t work as expected.\nIn conclusion, \u201cThe 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing\u201d it\u2019s a must-read book for people working in marketing and other related areas.\nFor sure there are many other tips which can help in marketing, but the authors had chosen the fundamental laws of marketing, those \nlaws which can be \u2018violated at your own risk\u2019 only!\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free\u00a0\n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nFinal Notes:\nUnderstanding the principles that guide the consumer mind is critical to success in the modern world.\nMarketing is a constant struggle for a piece of the mind and the customer\u2019s attention, so you must understand how you can shape these perceptions and what perceptions and minds you should attack.\nMany marketers want to be number one or emulate what the leader does, but in most cases, this is not the best way. Follow immutable laws, and you will have a winning strategy."},
{"title": "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up PDF Summary", "url": "https://blog.12min.com/the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-pdf/", "cover": null, "content": "9 min read \u231a\u00a0\nIf anyone tells you that things have souls and feelings \u2013 I bet you call them CRAZY.\nBut take a look around your home. How many useless things can you name in 30 seconds? If you counted more than 5, I have bad news for you: Huston, YOU have a problem. It\u2019s time to break up with some old useless stuff and make space for new ones.\nThis is all about \n\u2019s book. Amazing topic, right?\nI bet I caught your attention. But don\u2019t worry! We all suffer from the same disease: having a box with memories, at least one drawer with \u201cdiverse things\u201d and a garage full of objects that \u201cmight be useful someday\u201d.\nBut Marie Kondo\u2019s book \u2013 The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying \u2013 was written to put in order your thoughts, life, and stuff.\nAll you have to do is to start reading it!\n is a Japanese cleaning consultant \u2013\u00a0quite famous in her native country.\nAfter this book appeared and was published in more than 30 countries, she\u2019s considered a specialist in this area. The method she uses is called KonMari, a combination of her names.\nMarie admits that she was fascinated by the subject of tidying from a very early age and was always looking for ways to improve this skill.\nShe managed to transform her passion (and obsession, some might say) for a clutter-free space, into an innovative business model and she offers consultancy to individual clients and companies that want to transform their lives.\nThis book is only one of the four she wrote on this particular subject, but it\u2019s also the most well-known, outside Japan.\nThe structure of the book is very easy to follow, it only has 5 big chapters, each dealing with some specific topics.\nThe KonMari method consists of two big steps that you need to take in order to tidy your house. First, you need to gather all your belongings from one category and start discarding the things that you don\u2019t need.\nLiving in a consumerist society, at first, you might be under the impression that you need everything. So, the key question is:\nIf the answer is yes, you can keep the item: \nThe trick in applying this method is tidying by category.\nThis means that you should first start with your clothes, then books, then random objects and only in the end you should approach sentimental items like photos or letters.\nBy following this category rule, you won\u2019t be tempted from the beginning to procrastinate or be absorbed into memories of the past, or become too emotional to continue the process.\nAn interesting topic that I found in this book was about the stuff that we receive as presents.\nMany of us have old gifts that we don\u2019t really like or use, but we don\u2019t want to throw them away because we don\u2019t want to hurt the feelings of the person that got us those presents.\nMarie tells us that it\u2019s ok to let go of those things. Their purpose in our lives was fulfilled and their mission is complete:\nThe author stresses the importance of tidying quickly and in one session because only this way\u00a0it\u2019s possible to have a complete shift of perspective:\nYou need to understand the difference between tidying and cleaning.\nYou will still need to clean your house on a regular basis. Only that now, because it has so much more free space and no clutter, this process will be easy and it will take much less time.\nThe key is putting the objects in their place after using them. How do we know where their place is?\nYou can designate a place for each object, but the design of the house itself will also help you: \nThe author has very strong beliefs about the importance of folding properly. She says that if you stack your clothes one on top of the other, chances are, that the items at the bottom will never be used.\nAnd I have to agree with her.\nSo she even made a few videos to teach us how to fold properly and how to arrange things in your closets and drawers so that you can see all of them when you open the doors.\nThe big advice isn\u2019t to pile things up. Not even books.\nEven if we tend to put them in a pile because it saves some space, the ones at the bottom of the pile will be forgotten and they are just occupying extra space.\nFor me, this part of the book was the most difficult to read. I love books and I have large shelves with books everywhere. I don\u2019t feel like I could choose only 30 books to keep in my house. But I also understand a bit the author\u2019s point of view.\nI\u2019m aware that I might never read some of the books that I purchased from impulse:\nWhat I think might be a little difficult for some people from western societies to understand, is the rituals that Marie Kondo has with the objects.\nShe treats them as things that have a certain energy and even \u201cfeelings\u201d, addresses them daily to show her gratitude and when she parts with an object it\u2019s usually done in a small ceremony that she designs.\nIt was weird for me at first too, when I started reading that she greets the client\u2019s houses and has a small dialogue with it, but after thinking about the \n between Japan and the US or other western countries, I decided to be more open-minded and not to label these actions.\nThe secret to tidying is to sort by category. Because if you only clean one closet at a time, you will be surprised to discover that you have similar items in other closets as well.\nSo, for example with the clothes, search for all the items around the house and make a big pile in the middle of the room.\nOnly then, you can start taking each item in your hands and ask the magic question: \n?\nDo the same with all categories (books, miscellaneous, photos) and then you will really have an organized house.\nBe careful with the items that promise you extra storage. This means most clutter for you to stack.\nYou already have the necessary space for all the items that are important to you. You don\u2019t need more space, you need to discard the items that have outlived their purpose or that bring you no joy.\nKeeping a clutter-free house will help you reevaluate your entire life. You will gain clarity and perspective. Many of Marie Kondo\u2019s clients said that their lives were completely changed after this process:\nThe key is to be ready for such a change and put some effort into this once in a lifetime process of tidying your house."},

And Why?\nAs the title implies, \u201c\n\u201d tackles conventional business-doing logic, and puts profits at the center of operations.\nNo more excuses as to why you should plow back all of your profits, and not having a pinch at the chubby quarterly checks!\nWith that in mind, we reckon that \u201cProfit First\u201d is best suited for entrepreneurs and those in the making. Keep an open mind, dive right in!\nAbout \tMike Michalowicz\n (entrepreneur, author, keynote speaker) has had a lot of ups and downs in his career.\nAfter selling two multi-million-dollar companies, he went onto becoming an angel investor.\nUpon squandering his fortune, he set on discovering a formula that will ensure profitability from the outset.\nHis insights and methods are taught in Universities and applied by companies worldwide. \n\u201cProfit First PDF Summary\u201d\nPutting together a list of qualities and ideas you came up with, and weaving them into a business plan is nothing short of a miracle. \nOn top of that, being able to proceed with limited resources at hand, is certainly something to be admired. \nPerhaps, you\u2019ve been there as well.\nEventually, you\u2019ll start feeling as if this huge, money-making machinery, has turned into a cash-eating monster that needs to be tamed.\nBut how?\nHow can you address this problem? Most entrepreneurs put \u201cgrowth\u201d at the center of their endeavors, thinking that more sales, more customers, and more funding could salvage the situation. As far as Mike is concerned, Growth is only half the solution.\nSome entrepreneurs even reckon that running a business is the closest you\u2019ll ever get to experiencing a nervous breakdown beforehand.\nIt\u2019s like a horror story, with no end in sight.\nWoooah, let\u2019s backpedal a bit to get a clue on how to fight off these tendencies.\nMike starts by pointing out that not every sale is a good sale.\nThink of it this way, if you decide to create a new product add-on in order to increase your sales, but you don\u2019t envision your company selling that kind of products; then you need to stop harming your business.\n as Mike likes to call it is a mindset that is not driven towards a vision. \nIt\u2019s an ill-considered decision predicated upon our desire to get out of a crisis, at the expense of our broader picture, which we often neglect.\nIn doing so, we end up squandering opportunities and money, taking bad clients, and making short-sighted decisions.\nRevenue generation is by all accounts the pitfall we so often fall into.\nAs one falls deeper and deeper, it tends to justify anything that brings in more money even if that means evading taxes.\nThe devil is in the details \u2013 sounds familiar?\nThe GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) claims to have all the answers as to how a business can optimize its operations.\nStart with sales, subtract direct costs (the cost of manufacturing or producing your product/service), pay the employees, subtract indirect costs, pay taxes, and then redistribute the profit.\nThis cycle is composed of \n, and \nNice logic, but is it feasible?\nAs the monster grows bigger, it takes more effort to feed him.\nHigher direct costs, higher wages, higher indirect costs, and then suddenly we are on a page where every client is a good client \u2013 regardless of how it can impact our business.\nMeanwhile, our utilities increase and subsequently there are bigger issues and loans for you to take care of.\nThat\u2019s why the Profit First system, is by far the most effective way of looking at a business.\nWhat if you look at the profit first, instead of being just another \n?\nThe Profit First Accounting method, takes a different approach, and it revolves around not how much money you spend and earn, but the difference between these two.\nWhile conducting this experiment, Mike realized that the paycheck-to-paycheck system is a living hell.\nFed up with insecurity, he set his thoughts on profitability and building a system that will underpin his efforts.\nHere\u2019s how to do it:\n \u2013 Go to your bank and set up four accounts: \n \u2013 Set up two more savings accounts with a bank other than the one you are using for daily operations.\n \u2013 You don\u2019t want any deals nor conveniences regarding these accounts.\nJust deposit the money, and leave them be \u2013 forget about them, completely.\nIn the entrepreneurial world you\u2019ll often hear this question \u2013 How big is it?\nWell, if you have a dirty mind, this may seem laughable but people are actually talking about your business. \nHow many employees, what is the extent of your operations, etc.\nProfits? Nah, I would rather talk about something else.\nMike talks about a guy he met at a global entrepreneurial summit \u2013 Phil Tirone (the founder of 720CreditScore.com).\nPhil told him that over the years, he witnessed the misconceptions most people had about wealth.\nThey are all hiding their financial predicament, and want to give the impression of \n, but that\u2019s rarely the case.\nNowadays, the America business culture happily embraces the thesis \u2013 \n.\nEven investors have given up on finding stable businesses that have become such a rarity today, that is almost unbelievable. Accumulating debt and living in a crappy apartment is regarded as the way to go.\nIf we keep putting profits at the bottom of our to-do list, we\u2019ll never be able to enjoy the fruits of our labor.\nHow healthy is your business, to begin with? Most of the times, pretty detrimental, but where there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way, and Mike has the answer.\nThis is a Profit \n Form, and it will help you understand what it takes to make your business profitable.\nNo more day-to-day panic attacks, because profitability is not an event, but a habit and way of life.\nIf by any chance you feel overwhelmed by this book, Mike advises you to take a breather and come back when you feel ready to face the music.\nMeanwhile, you are required to put at least 1% to a separate account and keep it low for a while.\nEntrepreneurs, in general, encounter two problems when they embark on the Profit First system.\nWhen you decide not to take caution like Mike did; out of habit, you\u2019ll probably put the blame on the system.\nOn the other hand, if you rack up the profits like really quick, try to remain with both feet on the ground. It\u2019s not over yet! \nThe path leading to the impeccable implementation of the Profit First system is composed of a series of small steps, that give the impression of trivial tasks.\nAnd remember, long gone are the days when everyone would get their fair share of the monthly work, except you (the owner).\nWhy would you even bother building something that condemns you to a lifetime of servitude? You would say, that\u2019s the best way to achieve growth but is it? When you were first starting out, the business had very few employees (if any), and in fact, you were 10% entrepreneur and system-builder and 90% employee.\nAs the company grows (in terms of profit, not revenue), you\u2019ll be able to transition from working for the business to working on the business.\nSo you might be wondering, what actions are required to make this happen:\n: Determine your custom Profit, Owner\u2019s Pay, Tax Percentage based on your industry\n: Adjust the numbers in your Instant Assessment Form\nOne story that Mike lays out for us shows exactly how powerful your mindset can be when opting for the Profit First system.\nA promising and gifted motivational speaker started off on the right foot by disclosing a step-by-step system that will help anyone to convert 80% of the audience when holding a speaking event.\nOne of the attendees accepted the challenge and went on to test it.\nShe managed to reach 25% in a short amount of time.\nWith time, she broke the 50% barrier and eventually landed the 75% mark.\nAt one occasion, she laid eyes on the instructor who advised her to use the system in order to increase sales.\nShe was curious to find out what is needed to reach the 80% milestone, and he replied: 80% I said 18%. \nThe reasonable goals others have set shouldn\u2019t be construed as your limit, but as an opportunity, for you to exploit.\nBefore you opt for a full-scale transition make sure to notify your accountant; a word of warning \u2013 you might not hear words of encouragement.\nIf that\u2019s the case, find a new accountant.\nAnother thing that Mike believes to be noteworthy \u2013 this is not \u201c\n\u201d kind of thing. It\u2019s more like \u201c\n\u201d kind of thing.\nSo, the first quarter is drawing to a close, and it\u2019s time to see whether the strategy has panned out!\nSometimes, your fiscal year, will not match the calendar year, but let\u2019s assume that it does.\nOn the first day of each new quadrant, you need to distribute the profit on your Profit Account.\nTake 50% of what\u2019s in there, and leave the rest as a reserve.\nTry not to make any excuses as to why you shouldn\u2019t do that. And if the company has multiple owners, distribute the profit based on the percentage of equity owners.\nIt\u2019s celebration time.\nUse your Tax Account to cover the finalization of taxes.\nIf you come short, use the money left in the Profit Account to reimburse the loss.\nMake sure to give this book a nice read, because it covers way more things than what we could have listed here.\nIt\u2019s worth it!\nKey Lessons from \u201cProfit First\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Get your hands dirty\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take action or collapse\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fill in the shoes of great leaders\nGet your hands dirty\nGenerating revenues can be both a blessing and a curse, depending on the structure of the business. Owners who go about hiring extra people in order to get as far away as possible from the operational responsibilities are the ones with the least healthy business.\nNot that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, but you should bear in mind that this will reflect badly on your income and profits.\nIt takes time before you can actually hand over the hard work to others, and focus on growth.\nTake action or collapse\nThe business reality is anything but pretty.\nSometimes, you need to take drastic steps such as firing your accountant or doing some things that you\u2019ve never done before.\nIt\u2019s your job to embrace profitability as the only way to run a business, and not be merely a revenue-driven organization.\nFill in the shoes of great leaders\nGreat leaders know how to get things done, and there\u2019s no \u201cCan\u2019t\u201d in their vocabulary.\nGird your loins, and go out there!\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free \n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cProfit First Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nIt comes as no surprise to anyone that Mike\u2019s books receive a boatload of praise and prestigious accolades.\nTheir widespread momentum is fueled by actionable rhetoric and guide, that penetrate deep into the business environment and questions its methods.\nKeep learning; keep reading."},

And Why?\nBefore we go any further, it\u2019s important to understand that this process applies to all organizations, regardless of their shape and size.\nEven if you are just starting out in the business world, \u201c\n\u201d is nothing less than a tool that will render assistance in the pursuit of market dominance.\nDon\u2019t be afraid to reshape your mindset, and get one step closer to prosperity.\nAbout Donald Miller\n is an American entrepreneur, author, public speaker, and the CEO of \n.\nHe came to prominence by raising awareness of the interactions between brands and customers, and how both parties need to act.\nAlso, his \n was on the New York Times bestselling list.\n\u201cBuilding a StoryBrand PDF Summary\u201d\nOne thing is almost undeniably true \u2013 marketing has evolved. \nBusinesses nowadays have to be more creative, data-oriented, and eager to learn in order to compete in a crowded environment. \nAmong other things, Donald also points out that organizations which put the emphasis on stories will be the ones dominating the industries.\nMike McHargue or science-Mike jumped onto this thread, by explaining that our brains are hardwired to look for solutions or products that will help them meet their basic needs.\nUpon doing this, people can turn over to more psychological, physiological, or even spiritual needs that give meaning to life.\nAnd your job, \n, is not to shout nor scream in the ears of your customers.\nIt\u2019s not about conveying the message loud enough but making sure that you are listened to.\nOkay, off we go!\nIn addition, let\u2019s dredge up the two most common mistakes most brands make:\nNow, let\u2019s shift to something of immense utility to all individuals.\nHow to capitalize on today\u2019s behavioral patterns, and what principles you must embrace as a brand to facilitate this?\nFirst off, one must understand that telling a story is the bridge between paying attention and neglecting something.\nDonald Miller labels it as the best tool against the \u201cnoise\u201d dwelling in the overly abusive and pushy culture.\nThink of it as a Movie Trailer.\nPrior to having the Video uploaded on YouTube, it undergoes a series of cuts, edits, omissions, retakes, etc.\nIt\u2019s all done under the banner of \u201cdelivering\u201d the story and captivating the audience.\nIf your main character in the story is suddenly interested in dozens of stuff, rather than excelling at one particular thing, your audience\u2019s attention will suddenly flip upside down.\nIn 1983, Apple launched Lisa and contacted the New York Times to publish an ad that encompasses all the features this computer had to offer.\nThey soon found out that geek-talk is not going to fly anymore.\nInstead, they partnered with Pixar, (a genuine storytelling factory) and went from 9-pages long geek-ad to \u201cThink Different.\u201d\nNow that is a kind of message that will evoke interest and perhaps entice customers to give it a shot.\nApple reached new heights by following the three-pillar program:\nDo you need a hero?\n100%! \nEvery story needs a driving factor or someone who can defeat the odds, rise to the occasion and come out a winner.\nThe challenges lying ahead must be perceived as an opportunity, not as a problem.\nLast but not least, what will the hero\u2019s life look like if he/she does (doesn\u2019t) do what\u2019s expedient?\nYou need to ponder these questions and give them a second thought because they truly are the \n.\nFrom a customer perspective, there are also three questions of equal importance:\nIn order to eliminate the dull part of any message, companies and \n.\nIn this book, you\u2019ll come across something called \u2013 SB7 Framework.\nThis framework acts as a filter that will help you in the endeavor.\nUpon completion, the entire scope of the message will be put on a single sheet of paper also known as \n.\nWith that thing covered, let\u2019s move over to the elements that compose the SB7 framework\nThe whole idea of brand-positioning must revolve around the hero, not the brand itself.\nIf you like to be regarded as a customer-centric organization, your customers mustn\u2019t feel as if you are solely profit driven.\nAs the author puts it:\nYou might have been led astray by recent trends that are built around the idea that customers want solutions to external problems.\nThe bitter truth is that customers are willing to pay a lot of money for stuff that tackles their inner turmoil.\nIn the simplest form, a hero lives and dwells in relative peace and stability, until one day that serenity is threatened by something.\nIf you can address their needs, it goes without saying that they will turn into brand evangelists.\nPerhaps, customers aren\u2019t that much engaged in identifying a hero, as they are on the lookout for a guide or mentor.\nIn many movies and theatre plays, we bear witness to the struggles of the main character, who is in a stranglehold and requires assistance from someone.\nThis person elevates our hero and helps him/her to cope with the pressure of decision-making.\nEvidently, brands need to establish some mental triggers that will incite customer to pitch in with the storytelling and act as if they are the ones propelled forward.\nCustomers don\u2019t trust just anyone.\nIf you select a random hero from the crowd, there\u2019s hardly any evidence that they\u2019ll be convinced into following his/her agenda without a proper plan.\nIt shouldn\u2019t come as a shock to you, that without information and planning, the likelihood of making the right decisions, decreases.\nAlso, Donald introduces us to two kinds of plans: the agreement plan and the process plan.\nBoth are predicated upon the idea of earning trust by detailed planning, rather than demanding it.\nYou might have noticed that heroes don\u2019t take action unless challenged.\nThere needs to be a reason, or should you prefer \u2013 a trigger that will inspire our hero to take the high road.\nBroadly speaking, there are two call-to-actions that actually work.\nDon\u2019t expect from your audience to jump on the bandwagon without being told to!\nIt\u2019s pretty self-evident that people, in general, don\u2019t prefer tragic endings.\nStories mesmerize the masses, but only if they reckon that something is at stake.\nApart from the anticipation and excitement, nothing is valuable nor worthy of their time.\nIn a nutshell \u2013 brands must explain to their customers the loss or the deprivation of quality that will emerge as a result of not doing business with them.\nAnd they all lived happily ever after. Who doesn\u2019t like Disney-tale endings?\nEven big-shot politicians use this trick to bring people over to a more beautiful place \u2013 far away from mundane concerns.\nIf you fail to engage with your customers, someone else will!\nIt all boils down to this \u2013 Your approach or messaging strategy must lean on a vision that illustrates how your product/service might affect the lives of your customers. \nNow that we covered all the steps in the StoryBrand Script, it\u2019s time to unpack the last aspect.\nEverybody wants to change for the better, and people are in need of transformation!\nOnly brands that participate in this mental transformation can create brand evangelist (passionate customers). \nIt goes without saying that at the outset; the hero is usually filled with doubt and self-pity, but as the story goes on, the hero develops skills and the mindset needed to wipe out the threat.\nLikewise, you need to explain what prompted the hero to rise to the occasion and what are the consequence of not doing so.\nOnce you have mastered (or at least in part) the messaging process, it\u2019s time to kick things off.\nProbably, you have one by now, but we are talking about something else.\nLong gone are the days, when brands needed millions of dollars to get traction and increase brand awareness.\n made it easier for growth-hackers and marketers alike to use creativity and psychological triggers. \nInstead of pouring money into some untraceable ads, you can build a Website that is relatively simple to grasp.\nHere are the five basics that any Website should have and build its offer around them:\nBy now, you have probably understood the significance of transforming the minds of the customers, but what about the employees?\nEmployees, by all accounts, also require some clear go-to signals in regards to how the mission statement is implemented.\nDonald Miller spotted an issue that crops up in almost every larger organization \u2013 \n.\nIts appearance is triggered due to a lack of alignment between employees, and not having a story that will act as a bond.\nTo tackle this, companies introduced the well-known \n, but only a few brands managed to get everyone on board by doing this.\nWith StoryBrand Script even a dull task becomes somewhat of an adventure.\nAnd you need all people under the same roof if you are keen on making progress.\nIn all honesty, a Mission Statement is nothing but a sequence of words; and since it doesn\u2019t promote a way of life, it rarely makes an impact.\nKey Lessons from \u201cBuilding a StoryBrand\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Get the word out\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tackle division within the organization\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Find the hero in the story\nGet the word out\nNobody will even consider your brand if you don\u2019t take any action.\nAlthough companies have been on that page for a while now; the ones that know how to do the right thing can be counted on one hand\u2019s fingers.\nTackle division within the organization\nIf you fail to promote the effects of synergy and teamwork, your organization will either collapse or become less efficient.\nThe people in charge must move beyond the mission statement, and find a way to engage the employees.\nFind the hero in the story\nYou saw that one coming?\nImagine how shallow it is to address the audience in a way that is only sales-driven?\nNobody is saying that you shouldn\u2019t make money (obviously), but your customers must feel the push radiating from the story you are trying to convey.\nA hero in their eyes is a victory in yours.\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free \n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cBuilding a StoryBrand Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nAre you ready for the next step?\nFirst, identify your ideal customers and then give them a reason to stay."},

And Why?\nis one of the ultimate psychology classics, and though written in a somewhat outdated style and a bit long (more than 400 pages) it\u2019s certainly a must for everyone who wants to understand better human beings and psychotherapeutic practice.\nThe book has been a bestseller for about six decades \u2013 so, we\u2019re pretty sure that it\u2019s more than just another book on how to live a more fulfilled life.\nIt\u2019s one of those which can actually help you attain it.\nAbout Carl Rogers\n was an American psychologist, one of the founders of the client-centered approach to psychology and one of the most influential psychologists in American history. \nUnsurprisingly, he received\nquite a few honors for his work, including the inaugural Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions in 1956 and the Award for Distinguished Professional Contributions to Psychology n 1972, both bestowed upon him by the American Psychological Association (APA).\nThough revolutionary in his time, many of his ideas are nowadays widely accepted by psychologists worldwide.\nIn a recent study, Rogers was rated by colleagues to be both the sixth most eminent psychologist of the 20\n century and the second most respected clinician, only to Sigmund Freud.\n\u201cOn Becoming A Person PDF Summary\u201d\nOne of Carl Rogers best-known books, \n \n.\nIt\u2019s also probably one of the very first psychology bestsellers: when it appeared in 1961 \u2013 Peter D. Kramer, M.D., writes in an \u201cIntroduction\u201d to one of the newer editions of the book \u2013 it brought Rogers \u201cunexpected national recognition.\u201d\n\u2013 Kramer goes on \u2013 \u201csold millions of copies when million was a rare number in publishing. Rogers was, for the decade that followed, the Psychologist of America, likely to be consulted by the press on any issue that concerned the mind, from creativity to self-knowledge to the national character.\u201d\nWith that being said, it should be noted that Rogers didn\u2019t expect such a thing; in fact, \nis not even a monograph, but a collection of articles penned by Rogers during a whole decade.\nHowever, he did compile (and edited) them after he had discovered that he wasn\u2019t writing for psychotherapists, but for \u201c\n \u2013 nurses, housewives, people in the business world, priests, ministers, teachers, youth.\u201d\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that he didn\u2019t consider psychotherapists to be people; on the contrary, in fact. And that is one of the main ideas of this book.\nLet\u2019s start with that one.\nA New Type of Psychology: Humanistic Psychology\nLet us guess: \nAs far as you and everyone you know is concerned, psychotherapy is all about smart-looking men or women sitting in a chair opposite you and asking you questions until they can help you reach a solution to your problems \u2013 or, even better, offer you one.\nRight?\nWell, Carl Rogers thought otherwise.\nYou see, he realized, after a pretty long career as both a researcher and a clinician, that he \u2013 or anyone else for that matter \u2013 is simply not competent enough to solve other people\u2019s problems. After all, everyone has them and what really puts one human being in a position above another one?\nAnd then Rogers realized something else: whenever he had come across a problem in his life, what helped and healed him wasn\u2019t a talk with someone acting from an above-position, but a conversation with one who is a peer in every sense of the word.\nEven without trying really hard, we guess that you can easily recall a situation in which a long talk with a friend made you feel better, or, to use the wrong word for the sake of simplicity, \n.\nThat\u2019s it, Rogers realized: all we need to live a more fulfilled life is to feel that our desires and actions are normal!\nAnd the job of a psychotherapist should be that: to listen attentively and pass no judgment over his patients, thus creating a safe environment wherein one can really get in touch with his true self.\nIf that sounds like something every psychotherapist ever has said to you at least a couple of times, consider it Rogers\u2019 fault.\n\u201cCertain ideas that Rogers championed,\u201d writes Kramer, \u201chave become so widely accepted that it is difficult to recall how fresh, even revolutionary, they were in their time.\u201d\nRogers\u2019 Influences: Humanist Psychology Is Existentialist Psychology\n, it\u2019s not like Rogers\u2019 fell from Mars; on the contrary: they are deeply rooted within the philosophy of existentialism which emerged from the ashes of the two great wars; especially the second one.\nLet\u2019s have a look at them, so you can understand Rogers\u2019 U-turn better.\nWe\u2019ve already told you a thing or two about existentialism\u2019s fundamental tenets while \nthe central work by, arguably, the greatest existentialist philosopher of the 20\n century, Jean-Paul Sartre.\nIf you remember well, Sartre\u2019s main idea was rather simply formulated: in humans, \u201cexistence precedes essence,\u201d i.e., there is no blueprint on how a human should look like (essence), so we are in charge of the meaning of our own lives (existence).\nIn other words, we are \u201ccondemned to be free\u201d (we can be whatever we want to), but we cage ourselves to exist according to certain principles (usually thrown at us by others), and we cage others by thinking that we know how \nshould live their lives.\nWhy?\nBecause it\u2019s easier for us to find excuses than to find ways; even though the former brings frustration, it is much more comfortable than the latter which always comes with a bit of fear.\nNow, Sartre\u2019s ideas were themselves inspired by the work of a great 19\n-century Danish philosopher with a complicated name, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard.\nIn Kierkegaard\u2019s eyes \u2013 recaps Rogers \u2013 because we can choose to be what we want to, \u201cthe most common despair is to be in despair at not choosing, or willing, to be oneself.\u201d And you can do even worse: \u201cthe deepest form of despair is to choose \u2018to be another than himself.\u2019\u201d \nConsequently, \u201cto will to be that self which one truly is, is indeed the opposite of despair,\u201d and (Rogers adds) \u201cthis choice is the deepest responsibility of man.\u201d\nIn other words (because Kierkegaard\u2019s and Rogers\u2019 are somewhat unnecessarily complicated), you can be whatever you want to be, but only if you choose to be \n, you will not feel despair at your choice.\nHow does this help a psychotherapist who wants to help a patient?\nTo understand that, we should probably introduce you to the idea of \u201cconfirming the other\u201d developed by Martin Buber, an existentialist philosopher and mystic from the University of Jerusalem.\nBuber says in a paragraph quoted (and edited) by Carl Rogers: \u201cConfirming means\u2026 accepting the whole potentiality of the other\u2026 I can recognize in him, know in him, the person he has been\u2026 \n to become\u2026 I confirm him in myself, and then in him, in relation to this potentiality that \u2026 can now be developed, can evolve.\u201d\nOnce again \u2013 unnecessarily complicated; let us rephrase it in Rogers\u2019 words: \u201cIf I accept the other person as something fixed, already diagnosed and classified, already shaped by his past, then I am doing my part to confirm this limited hypothesis. If I accept him as a process of becoming, then I am doing what I can to confirm or make real his potentialities.\u201d\nIn other words, if you can be whatever you want to be, what you are at the moment is exactly what you are \n (statistically, let\u2019s say that\u2019s only about 1% of your potential realized and you still have 99% to go).\nAnd a psychotherapist needs to start from there.\nHe/she needs to see you as \n in the process of becoming, and not as a finished product; in that way, only he can help you: not by dealing with your past problems, but by dealing with the possibilities that lie in your future; and they are all but endless.\nThe Laws of Human Nature: Rogers\u2019 Shift\nWe guess that you can already understand what kind of a shift Rogers introduced in the world of psychology; but one can understand this better if we compare his approach to the approach practiced by his predecessors.\nAnd, of course, most of them were influenced either by \n or \n.\nAnd, according to the fathers of psychology, there\u2019s something disturbing deep within each and every one of us; and it is a psychotherapist\u2019s job to help an individual either to do away with these dark impulses (Freud) or to embrace them and incorporate them in a healthier way in his being (Jung).\n\u201cOn the whole,\u201d writes Rogers, \u201cthe viewpoint of the professional worker as well as the layman is that man as he is, in his basic nature, had best be kept under control or under cover or both.\u201d\nHowever, during his practice, Rogers discovered something so \u201cforeign to our present culture\u201d that even he was aware that it would probably never be accepted by the mainstream practice.\nNamely, that \u201cthe innermost core of man\u2019s nature, the deepest layers of his personality, the base of his \u2018animal nature,\u2019 is positive in nature \u2013 is basically socialized, forward-moving, rational and realistic.\u201d\nRogers quotes two authors \u2013 Abraham Maslow and Ashley Montagu \u2013 as the \u201csolitary voices\u201d of protest against the widely accepted notion that \u201cman is irrational, unsocialized, destructive of others and self.\u201d\nWhy?\nBecause according to Montagu, \u201ccooperation, rather than struggle, is the basic law of human life;\u201d and according to Maslow, \u201cthe anti-social emotions \u2013 hostility, jealousy, etc. \u2013 result from frustration of more basic impulses for love and security and belonging, which are in themselves desirable.\u201d\nRogers\u2019 model of dealing with patients stems from these findings.\nLet the Patient Lead\nNow, if men are essentially good, then it\u2019s not your job as a psychotherapist to \n them but to \nthem.\nAnd \n does mean \u2013 almost always \u2013 \n judging, even if some things seem to you wrong or stupid. \nThis is how the famous (and now widely practiced) client-centered approach came to be.\n\u201cI become less and less inclined,\u201d writes Rogers, \u201cto hurry in to fix things, to set goals, to mold people, to manipulate and push them in the way that I would like them to go. I am much more content simply to be myself and to let another person be himself.\u201d\nAnd Rogers went even a step further: the idea that the therapist should stay calm no matter what was a foreign one to him, because honesty is possible only in good relationships and good relationships are always about two honest people \u2013 and not about a person spilling his guts out and a doll bereaved of feelings nodding opposite him.\nAt one place in the book, Rogers sums up most of his ideas about how a good consultant/client relationship looks like and what it does \u201cinto one statement.\u201d\nWe believe it deserves to be quoted in full:\nI believe,\u201d concludes Rogers, \u201cthat this statement holds whether I am speaking of my relationship with a client, with a group of students or staff members, with my family or children. It seems to me that we have here a general hypothesis which offers exciting possibilities for the development of creative, adaptive, autonomous persons.\u201d\nBecoming a Person\nWhat Rogers realized in his years of treating patients was that the real problem with each and every one of them was always one and the same: they weren\u2019t living in a way which expresses who they are. \nAll of them locked themselves within the confines of an existence which is both foreign to them, and, even worse, final.\nThe trick is to realize that you have never \n, but you are always \n; and that, like every other process, \n is messy, filled with contradictory feelings and beliefs that must be freely analyzed through and not forcefully controlled by someone on the outside.\nIn a way, the latter is the real source for the problem:\nKey Lessons from \u201cOn Becoming A Person\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Humanist Psychology Is Existentialist Psychology\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Good Relationships Breed Good People\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Good Life Is About Becoming, and Becoming Is About Fulfilling Your Potential\nHumanist Psychology Is Existentialist Psychology\nCarl Rogers is widely credited as one of the founders of the humanist (client-centered approach) to psychology.\nThe idea behind it is deeply rooted within the philosophy of existentialism (Kierkegaard, Buber, Sartre): namely, that we are free to choose to become whoever we want to, but are frustrated because we are trapped in an existence which doesn\u2019t express us.\nConsequently, it\u2019s the job of a psychotherapist to listen to his/her patient, rather than trying to fix him/her.\nBecause only in the first case the psychotherapist truly believes that the person sitting next to him is a person, someone in the process of becoming something, and not someone whose existence is already fixed.\nBy doing the latter, regular psychotherapists don\u2019t understand the main of people\u2019s problems: their inauthentic lives.\nGood Relationships Breed Good People\nSo as to help a patient (or a lover or a child or a friend), it is the job of a psychotherapist (or a partner or a parent or a colleague) to create a safe environment.\nAnd the safe environment can be created only within the \u201cgenuineness and transparency\u201d of a good and trusting relationship.\nThis means, among other things, not acting, listening attentively, refrain from judging, being as honest as possible; or, in a sentence, it means being yourself and letting the others be themselves as well.\nEven if you are a psychotherapist. \nThe Good Life Is About Becoming, and Becoming Is About Fulfilling Your Potential\nThere\u2019s another quote from this book we thought we shouldn\u2019t omit, especially having in mind the fact that one of the most influential Western intellectuals at the moment is \n.\nWell, in a way, Rogers was Peterson before Peterson \u2013 even though he expressed this in much kinder words:\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cOn Becoming A Person Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nCarl Rogers\u2019 \nis one of the essential psychology books not only of the past century but of all time.\nWe can\u2019t recommend it enough."},

And Why?\nWhen the author talks about \u201csimple,\u201d he mostly refers to the power that is currently resting in your hands.\nSo, no external elements could stop you in this pursuit, if you have the wits and fortitude to do what it takes.\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s pretty accurate to outline that \u201c\n\u201d is prescribed for any person who wants to escape the difficulties of financial dependence.\nYou\u2019ll not be given a secret treasure map, but a proven approach that will likely improve the probability of achieving independence (in a financial sense).\nAbout \tJ L Collins\n is one of those guys you would say has a very \u201cdiverse\u201d job experience.\nFrom picking up metal ice cream cans to hosting a radio show, he truly had ups and downs regarding his career choice.\nHaving visited many countries and talked to a lot of people, he had this urge to share his encounters and revelations with the world.\nApart from being a writer, he is also a blogger (\n) who tries to spread financial knowledge.\n\u201cThe Simple Path to Wealth PDF Summary\u201d\nEven kids, broadly speaking, get the drift of what\u2019s going on with the world, and how money is the great influencer. \nJ L Collins starts by explaining that money bring pressure to bear on people, but not all of us can understand the complexity behind making money. In this challenging world, one is presented with two options:\nThe so-called, investors who are making the case that everything related to investments is so darn complex, are lying to you. It\u2019s in their best interest to make you dependent on their \u201cexpertise\u201d while they rack up the profits.\nAlso, the pursuit of financial independence mustn\u2019t be associated with the notion of retirement. \nBut, let\u2019s take a quick throwback to where it all began.\nAs a young boy, Collins had this intrinsic characteristic to earn and save money. \nHe would go from door to door, picking up pop bottles and making a few bucks here and there.\nHe also came to the conclusion that financial independence, is as much about being able to cover your needs, as it is about increasing your wealth.\nThe learning curve took an unexpected turn, when J L Collins at the age of 25, decided to travel across Europe. \nAt the time, he didn\u2019t know that working conditions were negotiable. \nHe went to his boss\u2019s office and asked for four months of unpaid leave. Upon getting a firm \u201cNo,\u201d he went home to give this whole pickle a second thought.\nAfter a while, he handed his resignation but was convinced to stay after he was given 6-weeks leave.\nThat day he learned \u2013 \n.\nIn the following years, he would experience a lot of ups and downs; unpaid leaves, tough decisions, remarkable revelations, and insights.\nBut, it will always seem as if freedom is something that you should bend over backward to achieve.\nUnlike other books which put emphasis on buying your financial freedom, J L Collins puts stock in achieving it.\nAs you get older, you\u2019ll understand the value of each day, and why you should not give any thoughts to \u201chow things will work out.\u201d\nOver to more serious business \u2013 Debt.\nThe US alone has accumulated a debt of over $16 trillion, and while one side of the financial spectrum argues that it\u2019s rejuvenating the economy, others fear potential collapse.\nMore than half of the debt can be assigned to mortgage debt; also a substantial amount (in trillions of dollars) can be attributed to student loans.\nSo, what should you do, if you already have one of these?\nEven though the mantra is \u2013 \n, there are a couple of things worth considering:\nSo, what now?\nMake a list of your spending habits, and debts ranked from the highest interest rate to the lowest.\nDon\u2019t hire a consultancy agency to help you out in this endeavor, because they cannot make it less painful than it actually is. You and you alone must make this work.\nOnce you have changed the ostentatious lifestyle into something more appropriate, then you can redirect the \n.\nIs it going to be simple? \u2013 Yes, but not easy.\nAre there any good debts?\nMost people argue that mortgage debt is one of the very few ones, probably coupled with business loans that might generate a higher return on investment.\nBut don\u2019t be so sure.\nIf you decide to build a home that far-greatly exceeds your needs, it might be hard to achieve independence.\nWhen it comes to student loans, in the 70s, let\u2019s say it cost about 1500$ to get into college and pay off your first year. \nAlthough inflation had a huge effect on the overall economy, it\u2019s very unethical to demand from 19-year-olds to take on a massive pile of debt, sometimes racking up more than 200,000$ in order to obtain a college degree.\nAs one person put it \u2013 \n.\nAnother question that seems to be on everyone\u2019s lips is \u2013 Can you retire a millionaire?\nTechnically it is possible for middle-class people to reach the $1million landmark in their lifetime.\nIt only takes around 2000$ a year of investment in the period of 30-40 years for one to reach that goal.\nBut, money is a very relative phenomenon, and the ultimate goal is to achieve financial freedom.\nThe secret is to spend less than you earn, invest the surplus and stay away from debt as if you are running away from the devil.\nInvestments and Money-Mindset\nThis world has no shortages of people who have reached the sky, earned millions of dollars only to declare bankruptcy years later.\nVarious factors contribute to that such as:\nIn the graph above, we can see the industrial growth in the 20\n century.\nThis is nothing but proof that industries will continue to develop, and grow with probably more rapid pace in the 21\n century.\nObviously, we want the gains the market can deliver, but you must understand the timing.\nSo, here how it goes:\nYou buy a stock at let\u2019s say 100$ and the value increases to 180$. \nWe need to sell at this moment, but when do we roll back into the game? At 20% slump or perhaps you should wait for a genie to whisper in your ear?\nThe point is \u2013 you need to be right twice (both high and low)!\nThe sad reality is \u2013 nobody can do it, because if someone could, it \n than Warren Buffett, to say the least.\nDo you start putting your money in an index fund, or perhaps going after top-notch companies?\nDon\u2019t start at all, if you are not prepared to see your wealth fluctuating or diminishing.\nNot a good offer, ha?\nIt\u2019s true that the market will grow in years to follow, regardless of overnight drops and crashes like in 2008.\nSo, here are the reasons why people lose money in the market:\nThey key to success is to keep it simple, and refrain from overreacting or being overly optimistic.\nEven the simplest formula has to be decluttered and here\u2019s how to do it:\nWhen you give thought to these pressing matters and decide what kind of investor are you, then you can move on and create your portfolio. \nJack Bogle, a renowned investor, and philanthropist who in his lifetime amassed a fortune of over US$80 million declared that not even he succeeded in besting the market.\nThe concept of indexing revolves around the idea of buying stocks at a given index.\nThe truth is \u2013 you can\u2019t pick winning stocks and no one can.\nYou can get lucky though, but in the long run \u2013 the house always wins.\nIntelligent and highly determined individuals see indexing as a challenge (probably to their vanity and intellectual capacity).\nThere\u2019s a great analogy that highly correlates with what J L Collins is trying to convey here.\nA couple of years back, he was taking street-fighting lessons.\nThe instructor said the following:\nIf you are not \n, then please keep your money into your pocket.\nDon\u2019t give it to a manager who promises you good results at the drop of a hat.\nThe greatest irony regarding investing is that the more you mess around with your portfolio, the less well you\u2019ll actually do.\nPut your eggs in one basket, and one day you might wake up rich.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Simple Path to Wealth\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eliminate unnecessary spending\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Go for the long run\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Money eliminates the necessity of doing things that you dislike\nEliminate unnecessary spending\nYou would be surprised to know how much money you can save if you have a better plan.\nPut all the financial liabilities and costs that might incur (monthly) on a piece of paper, and eliminate everything that you can do without.\nRemember \u2013 A dollar saved is a dollar earned.\nThink in the long run and be realistic\nMany investors argue that they can beat the system and beat it consistently.\nIf they could, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett would be nothing more than mediocre achievers, compared to the skill-set of these people.\nThat\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t go for stuff that are too good to be true.\nKeep your composure, and actively invest over a larger period of time.\nMoney eliminates the necessity of doing things that you dislike\nOut of fear, or perhaps due to our survival mindset, we are compelled to act in a given manner.\nDuring this time, we feel this immense pressure and negative energy but are left with very few options.\nMoney, on the other hand, gives you the freedom to do as you wish.\nOf course, there are some limitations, but much less than not \n. \nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free \n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Simple Path to Wealth Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nThe market is saturated with books and guides on how to get rich.\nBut, not all materials have that actionable element in them. \nUnlike people who popularize the get-rich-quick-scheme, L Collins promotes a more steady and long-term strategy.\nIn this book, you\u2019ll find what it takes to increase your wealth and gain the much needed \u2013 financial independence."},

A. Nilakanta Sastri\u2019s classic work, \n, \u201cnot many have tried to convey South India\u2019s story in a single study.\u201d\nQuite appropriately, \n begins where Sastri\u2019s work ends, recapping in its first chapter (\u201cSails on the Horizon: 1498 \u2013 1697)\u201d the rise and fall of the Vijayanagara Empire (1336 \u2013 1646) and the Deccan Sultanates (1527 \u2013 1686).\nAnd, of course, the narrative begins somewhere around 23 January 1565 when the last great medieval empire of the South, the Vijayanagara Empire, is soundly defeated by the combined forces of the Muslim Deccan Sultanates of Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Golconda and Bidar.\nNow, you\u2019d expect that after such a deciding victory the Deccan Sultanates would do something with it (like, we don\u2019t know, maybe start a new, even more powerful empire), but it seems that neither of the dynasties got the lesson from the victory (namely, that force lies in unity).\nAfter the victory at Talikota, the Deccan Sultanates reverted to in-fighting, and this made them an easy target for the Mughal Empire, a Mongol empire directly descended from both Timur and Genghis Khan.\nAt the same time, the Maratha Empire is also on the rise, as are a few other nayakas, princes, chieftains and poligars which rule with different regions across the South Indian plateau.\nOf course, the competition raging between all of these makes the job quite easy for the Europeans, mostly the British and the French.\nAnd we all know what would happen next, don\u2019t we?\nXVIII Century\nBut wait a second!\nBefore the British defeated the French and conquered India, they still had to face a formidable enemy in the southern Deccan.\nFounded at the very beginning of the XV century, the Kingdom of Mysore expanded its territories throughout the XVII century, especially during the rule of Narasaraja Wodeyar I and Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar.\nBy the beginning of the XVIII century, the Kingdom of Mysore had already much of what is now Southern Karnataka under its control.\nHowever, it reached the height of its powers in the second half of this century, first under the rule of Haidar Ali, and then \u2013 and especially \u2013 under the rule of his pretty controversial son Tipu Sultan, who managed to annex parts of present-day Kerala and Tamil Nadu.\n\u201cTipu and his father Haidar were central to the 18th century\u2019s second half,\u201d says Gandhi. \u201cBetween them, they provided a stable 38-year-rule that not only brought economic progress to a large portion of southern India, and it almost foiled Britain\u2019s conquest.\u201d\nAnd really: by the time Haidar came to power (1761), the Europeans had already asserted their presence on the continent, pitting nominally independent rulers against each other and dividing the Mughal and the Maratha Empire piece by piece.\nHaidar \u2013 though an illiterate man, in retrospect, a military, and economics genius \u2013 allied with the French and fought against the British the First and the Second Anglo-Mysore Wars.\nDuring the latter, the British (and the world) first saw (and were humbled by) the employment of rocket artillery in the history of warfare.\nThe Mysorean rockets served as the direct basis for the technology behind the Congreve rocket, which the British used effectively during the Napoleonic wars.\nHaidar Ali died from cancer during the Second Anglo-Mysore War (1782), leaving his son Tipu Sultan on the throne in the middle of a bloody war. \nEven though in 1783, a preliminary peace between France and Britain was agreed (leaving the Kingdom of Mysore ally-less), Tipu did manage to hold his ground on his own, winning several important victories against the British, and negotiating the \n which basically meant that he had won.\nOf course, this made the British a bit angry, and during the next two Anglo-Mysore Wars, they got their revenge, killing Tipu Sultan himself, who was killed on 4 May 1799 during the Siege of Srirangapatna, while he was defending his fortress.\nXIX Century\nThree things before we proceed:\nFirst of all, when we say the British, we do mean the British East India Company which, at around this time, \u201c\n;\u201d if that\u2019s not enough, the East India Company also employed an army of about 300,000 soldiers \u2013 \n!\nSecondly, Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan were not without serious failings; especially the latter one, who is more than controversial nowadays, for his treatment of Christians and Hindus \u2013 as well as for his tyrannical behavior.\nBut thirdly and finally, both Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan \u2013 as well as, say, subsequent freedom fighters such as Pazhassi Raja and Velu Thampi \u2013 (to quote Gandhi) \u201cdeserve a frank study of their lives in their times, not labels handy for squabbles in our times.\u201d\nIn other words, Tipu Sultan is part of India\u2019s history and, in his time, he was part of a war against a foreign enemy.\nUnfortunately, the last one:\nThe most important thing that happened during the XIX century as far as South Indi (and India) is concerned was the handing of its rule from a private company (the East India Company) to the British monarchy itself (\u201cA Gift for the Queen\u201d).\nThus, Queen Victoria became the \u201cEmpress of India,\u201d and the \n.\nXX Century\nIf the nineteenth century saw South India fighting against the British rule in no more than a few sporadic, isolated military campaigns led by nawabs and rajas, the XX century saw the unification of the subcontinent under the leadership of several prominent leaders and parties.\nIn addition to the influential national parties such as the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League, the Indians united in quite a few regional ones as well, such as the Andhra Mahajana Sabha, the Justice Party, and the Dravida Kazhagam. \nHere Gandhi treats his readers with quite a few engaging biographical sketches of prominent South Indian leaders (mostly socialists and communists) such as Annie Besant, EMS, C. N. Annadurai, Periyar E. V. Ramasamy, Perumal Varadarajulu Naidu, Kumaraswami Kamaraj, as well as his very own grandfather (through his wife), C. Rajagopalachari.\nUnsurprisingly, Gandhi is at his best when he chronicles this period, especially the Vaikom Satyagraha of 1942-25 which occurred five years before Gandhi\u2019s famous Salt March and which delivered the first major blow against the notion of untouchability in Hindu Society \u2013 especially in South India.\n\u201cIn the Malayalam country,\u201d informs us Rajmohan, \u201cVaikom helped the freedom and social justice movements to join hands. Elsewhere in India, the news from Vaikom confronted insulated caste Hindus with the ugly realities of untouchability and unapproachability.\u201d\nAfter India won its independence, new states were formed along linguistic lines (Tamil, Kannada, Malayali, Telugu, respectively) on the South: Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, and Andhra. \nGandhi ends his book with a look at the new generation of political leaders and optimism as to what the future holds.\nKey Lessons from \u201cModern South India\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The History of South India Is the History of Four Powerful Cultures\u2026 And Then Some\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0South India Was Ruled by Many Rulers \u2013 and That\u2019s Why the British Conquered It\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0South India: Unity in Uniqueness\nThe History of South India Is the History of Four Powerful Cultures\u2026 And Then Some\nAs Rajmohan Gandhi says, the history of South India is the history of four powerful cultures: Kannada, Malayali, Tamil, and Telugu.\nIn fact, modern-day South India is divided along the lines of these cultures in four states: Tamil Nadu (Tamil), Karnataka (Kannada), Kerala (Malayalam) and Andhra Pradesh (Telugu).\nHowever, even more than that, it\u2019s also a story of many other Indian cultures which have influenced and shaped them: the Kodagu, Konkani, Marathi, Oriya, Tulu and even some older and tribal ones.\nSouth India Was Ruled by Many Rulers \u2013 and That\u2019s Why the British Conquered It\nAfter the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, the last of the great medieval empires of the South, South India was divided between many kingdoms and rulers: the Deccan Sultanates, the Mughal Empire, the Maratha Empire, and the Kingdom of Mysore were merely the most prominent.\nThe Europeans \u2013 most notably, the British East India Company \u2013 used the competitiveness and the enmity between these kingdoms to conquer them, first by intrigue and then by force.\nHaidar Ali and Tipu Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore were the last two rulers from the South to oppose the British; after the death of the latter during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, Queen Victoria could proudly call herself the Queen of India.\nSouth India: Unity in Uniqueness\nAccording to Rajmohan Gandhi, there are at least three reasons why South India can be seen as a uniquely unified region of India.\nFirst of all, there are the geographical and the linguistic threads, which \u201chave given the South Indian peninsula its unity and distinctiveness. Because of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, European countries like Portugal, Holland, England, and France impacted the South in ways not experienced by northern and central India.\u201d\nSecondly, \u201cthe South\u2019s major languages have Dravidian rather than Sanskritic roots, even though their vocabularies have been enriched by borrowings from Sanskrit and elsewhere.\u201d\nThirdly, and finally, \u201cthe Dravidian/Aryan question resonates, not necessarily divisively, in many southern minds.\u201d\nBe that as it may, to conclude with Gandhi\u2019s words, \u201cfascination with the history of one\u2019s neighborhood can harmonize with interest in the national story.\u201d\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cModern South India Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nis dubbed, by its publisher, \u201ca masterpiece in every sense of the word\u201d and described as \u201ca rich, authoritative and magnificent work of history about the South that will be read, debated and reflected upon for years to come.\u201d\nFor once, this is not merely a marketing trick."},

With an earned respect, he has established himself as a great motivator and business advisor.\nAnthony was born on February 29, 1960, in North Hollywood, California \u2013 US.\nDespite being known for his business seminars, self-help meetings, and\u00a0infomercials, Anthony has also written some high-quality, engaging books including \u201cUnlimited Power\u201d \u201cAwaken the Giant Within\u201d \u201cGiant Steps.\u201d\nEven though he doesn\u2019t want to be regarded as a millionaire, Anthony is the founder of several multi-million companies that have an accumulated annual sales of 5 billion dollars.

It all starts with a clear perspective and by reducing your priorities.\nThis summary covers the inevitable rise of a person, who is no different than you. After a certain amount of time passes, Tony hopes that you will be his greatest success.\nThe author includes a step-by-step plan that will help you identify which emotions are empowering. According to Tony Robbins, everything that we do is related to our state of mind, the way we feel, and our emotions.\nEverything we do should be directed towards our enjoyment, to our well-being. It\u2019s only natural, don\u2019t you think so?\nIn the first chapter, \u201cDreams of Destiny\u201d, Robbins reminds us that we all had a dream at one point in our lives. But due to a number of reasons, we seem to have forgotten all about it.\nIn order to accomplish our dreams, we need to change. This concept of change is essential to anyone who wants to improve the quality of their life.\u00a0But what do we have to do?\nTake a look at these steps provided by Tony Robbins in \n:\n1. Raise your standards.\n2. \n.\n3. Change your strategy.\nCurious to find out more? If so, it\u2019s definitely worth reading the entire book!\nChapter 2, \u201cDecisions: The Pathway to Power\u201d, emphasizes the importance of decisions.\u00a0Robbins indicates that decisions design our lives, and I agree with him. In order to \n, he recommends making more and more decisions. This way, we will learn from them.\nThe third chapter, entitled \u201cThe Force That Shapes Your Life\u201d, talks about emotions, sensations that we link to our thoughts. These will either give us a sense of pain or a sense of pleasure.\nWhich emotions are empowering to you?\u00a0The ones that create pleasure or the ones that create pain?\u00a0Think about it!\nThe main concept of \n can\u00a0found in the fourth chapter, \u201cBelief Systems: The Power to Create and the Power to Destroy\u201d. Robbins talks about two types of belief systems: limiting belief systems and empowering belief systems.\nIn order to eliminate the limiting belief system, we need to link massive pain to the old belief.\nWe need to convince our brain that if we continue this way, we will inflict massive pain.\u00a0So, if we associate pleasure with the new belief, we\u2019ll feel great about adopting the new empowering belief system.\nIn chapter 6, Robbins introduces a new concept: conditioning. It seems that once we adopt change, it\u2019s difficult to maintain it in the long run. So he suggests \n, over and over again.\nIt may be easy to quit smoking, but it\u2019s more difficult to never smoke again because each time you face a stressful moment you\u2019ll have to urge to light a cigarette.\nChapter 7 includes the major questions we need to ask ourselves in order to get what we want:\nChapter 8 is about questions and answers. It seems that asking good questions leads to a good life. But what happens when you keep asking the same questions and still \n? Robbins tells us that we simply need to change our \n.\nThat seems easy, right?\nChapter 9 and 10 are related to the \u201cVocabulary of Ultimate Success\u201d, thus including metaphors.\nThe vocabulary that we use influences the way we think, feel, and live. I couldn\u2019t believe it myself until I continued reading this book. It does seem to be true that we think of the words we use when we\u2019re in an argument.\nIf we use words that make us feel powerful, we will feel powerful, like we can win an argument, thus avoiding pain.\nIn the next chapter, Robbins sets apart 4 types of goals and ways to achieve them:\nChapter 13, \u201cThe Ten-Day Mental Challenge\u201d, includes a recipe for success. As you\u2019ll notice from the title, Robbins recommends taking a ten-day mental diet. This means that you eliminate all negative thoughts and any stress that is\u00a0part of your life.\nA new concept, found in chapter 14, is the \u201cMaster System\u201d and its ultimate influence.\n(function(d,id){if(d.getElementById(id))return;var scr=d.createElement(\u2018script\u2019);scr.src=\u2019https://widget.\n.com/v0.2.0/widget.js\u2019;scr.id=id;d.body.appendChild(scr);})(document,\u201912min-widget-sdk\u2019);window.twelveminInit=function twelveminInit(){};\n\nIn the following chapter, Tony Robbins emphasizes the importance of values, because they are seen as our personal compass. They guide our decisions and thus, our destiny.\n\n\nIn order to check whether your values help you improve the quality of your life, Robbins suggests doing the following:\nIn chapter 17, Robbins emphasizes the importance of references in the fabric of life.\nThe more references you have, the more chances of you succeeding, as you have many choices available. Make as many choices as you need to, to find the right one.\nChapter 18 is about discovering our true identity. You can do this by following this plan:\nThe third part of \n\u00a0presents the \n:\nDay One \u2013 \n.\nDay Two \u2013 Physical Destiny: Prison of Pain or Palace of Pleasure.\nDay Three \u2013 Relationship Destiny: The Place to Share and Care.\nDay Four \u2013 Financial Destiny: Small Steps to a Small (or Large) Fortune.\nDay Five \u2013 Be Impeccable: Your Code of Conduct.\nDay Six \u2013 Master Your Time and Your Life.\nDay Seven \u2013 Rest and Play: Even God Took One Day Off!\nKey Lessons from \u201cAwaken the Giant Within\u201d\nThe real power of a proper decision-making mentality\nEverything that occurs in every person\u2019s life starts with determination and dedication.\nA right decision is the one able to generate a complete sense of satisfaction. This approach indicates a suitable shift in focus, precisely understanding true values in life and developing a long-term plan of activities to achieve the desired outcome.\nFor the same reason a person has to apply these six vital tactics in life to achieve success:\nPhysiology and Psychology are interdependent terms\nAs humans, we have countless emotional states. However, their occurrence will always remain a mystery. For a person to increase its chances of attaining personal success, it has to embrace the original and beneficial states.\nAlthough is easier said than done \u2013 a complete transformation on an emotional level is possible, all you need is a shift in focus.\nWhen you think about it, you\u2019ll see that emotions are not separate entities; they are also linked to physiology or the body language.\nAwaken the Giant Within\nQuotes\nOur Critical Review\nIf you follow the principles presented in Robbins\u2019s book, you will have the tools\u00a0to ensure your emotional, physical, relationship and financial destiny.\nMake a Decision And Commit. Focus Is Everything\nMany people know what they should do to succeed in life, but few go ahead and do what it takes.\nTo improve your quality of life, you need to master your emotions, your physical state, your personal and professional relationships, your money, and your time.\nTo take the reins of your life, you have to work hard. Your goal is to understand how the decisions you make in your day-to-day work and then take control of them.\nA decision always precedes an action. Therefore, to achieve the desired results, you need to observe the decisions you have made and continue to make in your life. Incredibly, external conditions have little influence on their accomplishments.\nAnyone can achieve just about anything she/he wants. Just decide and commit to your goals. Just awaken your giant within.\nIt is important for you to know: a decision is not a synonym of hope. It is not something that you decide on and expect to happen. Choosing means focusing; when making a decision, you must get rid of all the other possibilities and focus on just one outcome. Focus on what is important because you will become what you pursue.\nHuman beings seek to avoid pain and gain pleasure. We act consciously or unconsciously to do what we believe will please us or avoid suffering.\nTo make winning decisions, you need to amplify pain or pleasure.\nYou have to condition your mind to exaggerate the pleasure of doing something good and the pain of doing something wrong. You need to create mental associations between your goals and your feelings of pain and pleasure. With these emotional connections, you become capable of changing your behavior.\nAssociate your bad habits with things that cause you pain and associate healthy habits with things that will please you in the future. By creating this type of association, it is easy for your body to give up addictions and encourage healthy habits.\nWe act by believing that in the future something will bring us pain or pleasure. We need to understand this association to become winners.\nOur understanding of things that happen in our lives has a significant impact on who we are now and who we will be in the future. It is significantly affected by the things we believe in, our thoughts.\nUnderstanding our beliefs is the key to creating different visions of the same event in our lives. Most ideas come from past experiences that have brought us pain or pleasure. They are personal interpretations of the results of any event in our lives and exert significant influence on our future actions.\nOur brain is not always able to distinguish between imagination and physical experience because beliefs affect our perception. Therefore, it is necessary to work on the creation of our beliefs. To evolve as people, we need to work on changing our expectations.\nThe process to change an opinion is simple. First, mentally associate an old idea with pain. Think of a bad habit you have and visualize a mental image of something that causes you pain. Then project a new feeling and associate it with something that pleases you.\nYour goal should be a continuous improvement (in Japanese, kaizen). We should always seek to evolve and improve our beliefs.\nConstant and endless improvement should be a commitment reinforced by the attitude of continuing to improve gradually. This work will develop your confidence, from a steady and consistent effort, to know that, every day, you become a better person.\nNeuro-Associative Conditioning (NAC) is a process that associates intense desires with anything you wish to adopt and associates unbearable pain with anything you want to avoid.\nAlthough most people believe that changing old habits for new ones can take a lot of time, behavior patterns can change quickly and permanently. Conditioning yourself in the right way will enable you to bring about immediate change.\nTo recondition yourself, you need to follow six simple steps:\nThere is a direct connection between what a person wants to achieve in life and what they want to feel. Material possessions and personal relationships are simply\u00a0a means to an end; they are a way to achieve desired emotional states.\nYour behavior is the direct result of your current emotional state. Therefore, by changing your current emotional state, you can change your behavioral patterns and thus achieve the desired goals.\nThere are two ways to change your emotional state.\nThe first one says that impulse creates emotion. If you want to feel a particular emotion, start acting as if you already felt that way. The second one says that your focus becomes your perception of reality. So if your focus is on things that have not yet happened and you already feel good about them, you create a conducive environment for them to happen.\nMake a list of the activities you want to reinforce and create methods to focus on these activities most of the time.\nWords can create emotions that shape our destiny. Beliefs are shaped and changed by the words we speak. Therefore, the words you use in your daily life affect not only how you communicate, but also how you perceive the world and how you behave.\nBy changing your vocabulary, you change your thoughts and habits. Consciously choose the words you use in your day-to-day life, and you can change your life and your destiny. Use words that empower and scratch those which are counterproductive. Check out some tips:\nAnother important point is that the metaphors you use can stimulate or limit your life. When you use a metaphor constantly, you automatically begin to assimilate its advantages and limitations. Choose your metaphors carefully.\nYou use a metaphor whenever you explain a principle in comparison to something else. Metaphors are a way of learning. They provide a way to visualize unfamiliar concepts in familiar terms. By consciously using them, you can influence and shape your life experiences.\nTo transform your life, you have to understand that each person creates their feelings, which are valuable resources.\nThe most powerful emotions you can create are love, gratitude, curiosity, enthusiasm, determination, flexibility, confidence and joy.\nTo master your emotions and transform yourself, you need to be able to create these positive feelings. Some tips to create this type of emotion are:\nEvery person has the power to create their promising future. However, it is necessary to be clear about the goals and purposes sought. To reach this bright future, therefore, one must know how to define their targets and objectives. To create a goal, follow this plan:\nFirst, your goal should be clear, straightforward, and generous in detail. Second, every goal must have a clear plan associated with it. This plan should have activities, dates, and everything that needs to happen for you to get there. Finally, you need to visualize this goal. Twice a day at least, stop and think about your goal, your plan, and get ideas on how to reach it faster.\nIt is also important to focus on the journey and not just the goal. Achieving your goals is important, but enjoying the ride is much more, and it\u2019s what keeps you moving in the right direction.\nTake control of your thoughts and refuse to fight any bad emotion. Create a 10-day positivity plan and transform your life.\nYou need to know that your current operating system, your way of thinking, has led you to your present accomplishments. To move to new levels, you need to change the operating system. Follow the following method for this:\nIf you want to modify anything in your life, you must change the way you act. Changing how you feel about the things that happen in your life is much more powerful because it will automatically change your way of acting. So you have to understand the five elements that affect your feelings:\nChanging these five elements, or even just one of them, completely changes your way of thinking, feeling, and behaving.\nYour values guide all your decisions and are responsible for your future achievements. You must create a system of positive values to achieve lasting happiness.\nOne mistake many people make is to spend a lot of time worrying about what they want to have in the future when, in fact, they should focus on how they are spending their lives now. Values can be both negative and positive. They may be things you want to foster or things you want to avoid.\nHowever, it is important to be careful. Many people create limiting rules for their lives and end up delaying achievements.\nIt is important to build positive rules, focusing on the things you can control, not the random events of life. This discernment ensures that you control your destiny.\nA person\u2019s beliefs and values are selected through references, which are the personal experiences or experiences of others that one hears or sees in the media. The greater the number and quality of referrals a person has, the more he or she can make meaningful decisions in his or her life.\nTo expand the quality of your life, make consistent and conscious efforts to develop the references that impact you. Reading, for example, is an excellent way to expand your references.\nBe it in right or wrong situations, your feelings about it is based on the references used. You need to be able to learn from the past, but you can not live in it. No one drives a car constantly looking in the rearview mirror, which should only be used in some maneuvers.\nGrow your references circle, and you will create a new identity. New ideas and influences will not come out of anywhere. It takes a true effort to expand the limits of your mind.\nYour identity comes from the beliefs you use to define your individuality. You are what you believe makes you unique.\nMany people believe that their identities were shaped exclusively by their experiences. Even so, two people can go through the same experience and have entirely different memories and attitudes. More than a person\u2019s skills, their interpretation, through a system of beliefs and values, is far more influential in the formation of an identity than the experience itself.\nSo before you start shaping an identity, take time to think about where you are now. The steps to creating a powerful new character are:\nForget about the past and worry about the quality of your life in the present. Work to have an even better life in the future by accepting rather than avoiding change. Make conscious and rational efforts to develop a robust and dynamic identity.\nFinal Notes:\nMake sure you live your life to the fullest. Try everything and have fun. Enjoy the process as well as the destination. Combine the spontaneity of youth with the wisdom of experience, and keep growing and learning. Live each day as if it were the most important day of your life because it is.\nEach small decisions you make, define your destiny. Therefore, if a person controls how he or she feels, thinks and acts, they control their destiny, regardless of the external conditions that exist.\nFinally, it is essential that you seek a balanced life instead of pursuing perfection. Life is a balance between giving and receiving, caring for one\u2019s interests and contributing to the well-being of others."},

It\u2019s about how not to fall victim to that, but gain profit from it and, along the way, help the world become a better place.\nDiamandis and Kotler seem determined to defy Murphy\u2019s laws. They don\u2019t believe in \u201cwhatever can go wrong, will go wrong\u201d.\nThe prerequisite:\nFrom my point of view, this is the real but unofficial motto of \n, because it captures both the \u201chealthy disregard for the impossible\u201d and the bold attitude the book contains.\n starts with a metaphor. It \n. Just like the asteroid, the constantly-changing technology could kill the big, heavy, slow-reacting corporations.\nAnd it\u2019s doing that by making way for more agile, more open-minded and resourceful \u201cmammals\u201d \u2013 the small startups \u2013 to grow and evolve into something completely different in this new world order.\nAccording to Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler, we live in an age of abundance. The pair even wrote a book about this. It\u2019s called \u2013 you guessed it \u00a0\u2013\u00a0\n.\nThere are many fields about to explode. \n continues this optimistic view of the future by describing how all this abundance of technology can make anyone with a passion for \n much easier than a few years ago.\nWe\u2019re given a \n, how \n in just a few short years. The mistakes Kodak made are described in more detail in the book.\nBut the bottom line is that in this new world order\n.\nThis has never happened before, throughout our entire history. Kodak failed to take into consideration the exponential growth of photography and of mobile phone technology, and it suffered massively.\nThe main engine behind this exponential growth is digitalization. Everything these days is digital, and this means information becomes available to anyone around the world as it has happened (given a good Internet connection).\nThis also creates a lot of \n. That is, it creates a new market; therefore, the old one disappears. That\u2019s what\u00a0happened to Kodak. \n gives the examples of \n (which recently filed for bankruptcy), \n. Disruptors who changed the way the game\u2019s played because they could.\nIn case you\u2019ve already forgotten, Quirky is a platform for presenting inventions. Airbnb is challenging the hotels and Uber, the taxis.\nThis process is now a lot easier to overcome.\n is the period in which a technology doesn\u2019t reveal its true potential and has a relatively slow progress, or with little or no impact.\nComputers are always a good example. Digital cameras are another one, providing new details about the downfall of Kodak.\nThe time period between deception and disruption is critical. Diamandis uses Moore\u2019s law to predict when it occurs. Examples of staggering progress in robotics, artificial intelligence, 3D printing and so on leave us confused if we aren\u2019t reading the right kind of literature.\nThese are the technologies exiting the deception period and starting the disruption. What will the consequences be? No one can tell yet. \n isn\u2019t concerned with this. Perhaps this is one of the weak points of the book.\n sometimes \n and so \n occurs. Complicated stuff becomes easy and free and it sometimes replaces the need for material support altogether.\nThe smartphone is dematerialization materialized. It also represents democratization because it\u2019s affordable and practically anyone in the capitalist world can buy one. This was unimaginable a few years ago.\nPart 2 of the book gives us a glimpse into the \n.\nTesla CEO \n, Google\u00a0CEO \n, Amazon\u00a0CEO \n and Virgin CEO \n are the four main examples given for this mindset, besides Diamandis himself. This is the part where, as they say, the magic happens. It is the core of the book.\nAfter the introduction to exponential technology, we\u2019re given real-life situations. There, the bold people, like the four mentioned above, having no wealthy backgrounds, went for those technologies. They grabbed them and took them for a rodeo ride through the ups and downs of the modern business and innovation environment.\nI won\u2019t give many details about this part, but while reading it, you\u2019ll learn, amongst other things, about:\nThis isn\u2019t hearsay. Peter Diamandis met with these men, worked with them, interviewed them, helped them, was helped by them and they share the same \u201cbold\u201d mindset. In short, that\u2019s:\nIn other words, if something seems impossible, or an objective too big, then it means that there\u2019s no competition That means that you can get the best people to work on it, because they want to work on the most ambitious thing.\nYou also get to read \u201cPeter\u2019s laws\u201d, most of which you can also read in the nuggets. But in \n\u00a0there are additional explanations and guidelines to help you follow these laws and better understand them. You\u2019re is also encouraged to create your own set of laws based on past experiences.\nOnce Diamandis and Kotler give us the \n, they continue by providing the necessary tools for making our bold ideas come alive:\nThis is the part where \n\u00a0gets more down-to-earth and lists some steps and cautionary ideas to help entrepreneurs harness the power of the crowd. But, of course, things immediately go big and the possibilities and resources that are at our disposal seem infinite.\nIt appears that we only have to be passionate about what we do, to truly believe in our projects and resources, and\u00a0people and funds will appear. It\u2019s not that simple, and Diamandis and Kostler offer a description of the pitfalls that we might encounter.\nAll these possibilities give the common man unprecedented power.\nOr, to put it into plain English \u2013 \u201cgreat power is followed inseparably by a great responsibility\u201d.\nThe cautionary ending of \n\u00a0invites us to follow the path of the same exponential growth, not only in technology\u00a0but also in developing our spiritual, moral and mental sides.\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free\u00a0\n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nOur Critical Review\nIf we succeed, the future looks set to have an unprecedented turn, in a good way, which our history as a species has never encountered before.\nIf a failure occurs, let\u2019s hope it \u201c\n\u201d.\nEither way, after reading this book, the future certainly looks very interesting."},

And Why?\nAl Franken was an \n writer and performer on the show for most of the two decades between 1975 and 1995 and, subsequently, the US Senator for Minnesota from 2009 to 2018.\nAnd this is his memoir, which combines an interesting story with his political views and opinions, all of them wrapped up in a layer of funny anecdotes narrated in the funniest way possible.\nSo, there\u2019s something for everybody here: those who want to know more about Al Franken, those who want to hear what was going on behind the scenes while \n was becoming \n, and those who want to see what goes on in the Senate. \nFinally, those who simply want to laugh and amuse themselves on the subway while traveling to work.\nAbout Al Franken\n is an American comedian, politician, and author; he served as the US Senator for Minnesota from 2009 to 2018.\nAl Franken first became known as part of the comedic duo Franken & Davis; the pair was recruited as two of the original writers on \n, where Franken spent the two decades between 1975 and 1995.\nAfter leaving the show, he published five books on mainly political topics \u2013 \n, and \n \u2013 and decided to run for Senator in 2008, a race he won by 312 votes.\nFour years after being reelected in 2014, Franken decided to resign from his position in 2018, after several women came out with allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\u201cAl Franken Giant of the Senate PDF Summary\u201d\nWhy I\u2019m a Democrat\nEven though we\u2019re talking about a memoir here, \n, pretty unconventionally, opens with a chapter titled \u201cWhy I\u2019m a Democrat.\u201d\nThere\u2019s hardly any info as far as Al Franken\u2019s upbringing is concerned; and even that is interpreted only through the lens of the question above.\nOf course, the book starts with a joke \u2013 a great one, in fact: \u201cI was born in the house I built myself with my own two hands. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s not true. I got that from my official Senate website. We really should change that. Let me start over.\u201d \nAl Franken was born in 1951, 43 years after his father Joe Franken was born in New York City, and 27 after \n father \u2013 and Al\u2019s grandfather \u2013 Otto, a German immigrant, died from tuberculosis.\nIn 1955, when Al was merely 4 years old, Joe moved the family from New Jersey to a little town in southern Minnesota called Albert Lea to open a quilting factory.\nHe wasn\u2019t a good businessman, says Al, but he was a great dad; and they were a pretty close family.\nAnyway, Joe was a liberal Republican (endangered species nowadays), and Al\u2019s mother was a Democrat. However, after the Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater \u2013 a guy who had voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act \u2013 Joe Franken switched sides; and, naturally, so did Al.\n\u201cLBJ was right when he told an aide that Democrats would lose the South for a generation when he signed that bill,\u201d writes Franken. \u201cBut he got my dad. And, therefore, me.\u201d\nFranken\u2019s political credo is simple: \u201cDemocrats aren\u2019t just the party of equality for all \u2013 we\u2019re the party of opportunity for all.\u201d\nAnd his inspiration is Paul Wellstone, \n credo was: \u201cWe all do better when we all do better.\u201d\nSaturday Night Life: The Drug Part\nIn retrospect, it seems that Al Franken was into comedy ever since his early childhood; however, he really got into it after he met Tom Davis at The Blake School.\nThe duo \u2013 which specialized in political satire \u2013 was adored at Blake and first performed on stage at the Brave New Workshop theater.\nIn 1975, Franken and Davis got their big break: they were chosen as one of the original writers of the \n.\nFranken recounts his wonderful years with the SNL in three separate chapters: \u201cNot the Drug Part,\u201d \u201cThe Drug Part,\u201d and \u201cThe Part Where I Live.\u201d\n\u201cNot the Drug Part\u201d includes several wonderful and poignant memories \u2013 both on the scene and behind it; \u201cThe Drug Part\u201d reveals the darker side of it.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do a ninety-minute live comedy show week after week and do cocaine,\u201d the SNLers would say and sound convincing in the face of a few early accusations.\nThe truth, however, was scarier: \u201cmany on the show thought that you can\u2019t do a ninety-minute live comedy show week after week \n doing cocaine.\u201d\nThat all changed after the death of John Belushi; however, after Chris Farley \u2013 a man loved by absolutely everyone on the show \u2013 got into serious trouble, \u201ceveryone at SNL understood all too well.\u201d\nBoth Tom Davis and Franken\u2019s very own wife Franni Bryson struggled with addiction, and \u2013 as Al says \u2013 \u201caddiction can take an unimaginable toll on the people who love addicts; and that\u2019s true even when the addicts in question find recovery.\u201d\nin fact \u2013 possibly a little-known fact \u2013 the experience Franken had with Franni\u2019s early recovery from alcoholism became the basis for the 1994 movie \n, which Franken co-wrote with his friend (and Oscar winner) Ron Bass.\nComedy & Politics\nBack in 1992, during the first night of the Republican National Convention in Houston, Ben Stein and Al Franken commented live Pat Buchanan\u2019s \u201creligious war\u201d speech.\n\u201cIt was disorienting to watch a comedy broadcast,\u201d wrote \nat the end of the year, \u201cthat almost incidentally told more truth and offered more insight than most networks and newspapers and at the same time was so much more comfortable to watch.\u201d\nNowadays, of course, this is not disorienting, but quite commonplace: Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah are not just successful comedians anymore but also respected political figures.\nWhy?\nBecause \u201cnight after night, year after year, they offered more truth and insight than most real TV news.\u201d\nAnd, if we look back \u2013 thinks Franken \u2013 we\u2019d realize that this has always been so: \u201cBefore \n and \n, there was \n with Bill Maher. And before \n, there was \n. And before that, there was something Jonathan Swift wrote about the Potato Famine.\u201d\n(By the way, if you haven\u2019t, you should really read \n: three years after \n, he became the original political satirist).\nAfter leaving \nFranken\u2019s published a few politically engaged books whose success gave him the idea that he could make a transition from writing political satire to running for a place in the Senate.\nThough topical, some of the books \u2013 \n and \n \u2013 are still read and enjoyed.\nThe Senate\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day 2007, Al Franken formally announced his candidacy for US Senate from Minnesota; he won the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nomination with two-thirds of the vote.\nHis Republican opponent was Norm Coleman, who had been US Senator for Minnesota during the previous eight years.\nAs you probably know full well, the Minnesota 2008 Senate race was one of the strangest in history. Not because of all the accusations and scandals, but because of an eight-month-long recount process. \nIn the end, Franken won the race by 312 votes out of 3,000,000 cast \u2013 a margin of less than 0.01%. It was easier six years later when Franken won reelection with 53.2% of the vote over his Republican challenger Mike McFadden. \nFranken tried his best to prepare for a job he never thought he\u2019d work.\n\u201cLike Trump,\u201d writes the SNL writer, \u201cI had no previous experience in elected office. Unlike Trump, I was actually bothered by my lack of experience. I compensated for this by absorbing as much information in as much detail as I could.\u201d\nAnd so he did.\nThe book goes over some length on Franken\u2019s beliefs and proposals on many issues, ranging from gun control and health care (say, improving the dental care for Native American children) to education and climate change (\u201cVirtually everyone in the world believes that climate change is real and is caused by human beings, except Republicans in the United States.\u201d)\nThe main problem with these issues?\nThey need bipartisan support.\nMeaning, Franken needs to find a way to communicate with his colleagues even when this is impossible.\nHe\u2019s looking at you, Ted Cruz, \u201cthe Dwight Schrute of the Senate.\u201d\n\u201cI like Ted Cruz more than most of my other colleagues like Ted Cruz,\u201d writes Franken. \u201cAnd I hate Ted Cruz.\u201d\nLies and the Lying Liar Who Got Himself Elected President\nAs far as Al Franken is concerned, the problem with America today is not lies, but the fact that exposing them means virtually nothing to anyone:\n\u201cI firmly believe,\u201d states Franken, \u201cthat you can draw a straight line from Rush Limbaugh through Fox News through present-day websites like Breitbart and the explosion in \u2018fake news\u2019 that played such a big role in the 2016 campaign. And that\u2019s how someone like Trump can wind up in the Oval Office.\u201d\nWhen it comes to Trump, Franken goes all out attack and withholds none of the usual blows: he blames him for stupidity and notes that sometimes it seems as if he has some sort of mental health problem.\nHence his promise: \u201cI\u2019m going to keep fighting as hard as I can in the coming months and years to protect our children, our values, and our future from Donald Trump.\u201d\nThe Aftermath\ncame out on May 30, 2017; just a few months later \u2013 on November 16 \u2013 Leeann Tweeden accused Franken of groping; during the following few days, at least five other women said something similar.\nOn December 7, 2017, Franken announced that he was resigning his Senate seat, even though he maintains that some of these allegations are \u201csimply not true,\u201d while others he remembers \u201cvery differently.\u201d\nIn his resignation speech, Franken also noted the irony that Trump remains President despite his publicly known comments from the \n tape.\nEither way, Franken\u2019s promise stays; only now he\u2019ll have to keep fighting from somewhere other than the Senate.\nKey Lessons from \u201cAl Franken, Giant of the Senate\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Dark Side of \n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There Is No Better Political Commentator Than a Comedian\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Non-Effect of Exposed Lies: USA\u2019s Greatest Problem\nThe Dark Side of \nAfter \nbecame a cultural phenomenon, allegations surfaced according to which \u201csome of the cast and the writers of the show were smoking dope and snorting cocaine.\u201d\nEven though the SNLers claimed that it\u2019s difficult to do a ninety-minute live show week after week under the influence of cocaine, most of them thought the opposite was true.\nNamely, that it was impossible to do this \ncocaine.\nHowever, after John Belushi died and Chris Farley got into serious trouble, suddenly, drugs stopped being funny; however, it would be too late for Farley who\u2019d die as well \u2013 at the same age and the same way as his hero, Belushi.\nThere Is No Better Political Commentator Than a Comedian\nGeoffrey Hill, possibly the greatest English-language poet of the past few decades, claimed once in an interview that he\u2019d rejoice if his poems have the same effect on people as Ken Dodd\u2019s shows.\nApparently, he was right on track: comedians such as Stewart, Colbert, Oliver, and Noah are now much more than comedians \u2013 they are creators of the public opinion.\nAnd that\u2019s great \u2013 because people like to laugh at stupidity, and because most of the politicians are stupid.\nAnd serious political debates are too PC to hit the mark.\nIn other words: if you want the truth about the political situation in any country, go ask a comedian.\nThe Non-Effect of Exposed Lies: USA\u2019s Greatest Problem\nAccording to Al Franken, \n (after all, they\u2019ve always been there), but the fact that these lies, even when exposed, have no effect whatsoever on the public opinion.\nAnd he explains why:\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cAl Franken, Giant of the Senate Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nIt may be a bit controversial to say this after November 2017, but we do believe it\u2019s true: \nis not merely a funny book about politics, it is also a great one.\nIt may be \u2013 to quote Christopher Buckley from \n\u2013 \u201cthe funniest memoir by a sitting \u2013 standing, recumbent, squatting \u2013 U.S. senator.\u201d\n\u201cScratch that \u2018may,\u2019\u201d adds Buckley, and we concur. \u201cIt surely is.

And Why?\nis for everyone who thinks that the American Dream is dead and interested in finding the reasons which have contributed to this result; it\u2019s, even more, a book for those who think the opposite.\nBut, above all, it\u2019s a book about the upper middle class, the top 20% of America\u2019s population which holds about 90% of the total American wealth; and which is raging against the top 1% while being reviled by the bottom 40%.\nYup, we\u2019re talking about \n. You are the problem. And you should read this book to find out why and what you should do about it.\nAbout Richard V. Reeves\n is a British-born American scholar and writer, senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC.\nAfter earning a BA from Oxford University and a Ph.D. from Warwick University, Reeves became principal policy advisor to the Minister for Welfare Reform, and, subsequently, director of strategy to the UK\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister.\nA regular contributor to several journals (\n, \n, \n), Reeves moved to the United States in 2012 and became a US citizen in 2016. \nIn addition to \n, he has also authored a biography of John Stuart Mill.\nFind out more at \n.\n \u201cDream Hoarders PDF Summary\u201d\n, the American Dream is not dead \u2013 but only for about half of the American population blessed with the privilege of growing up in its more prosperous countries where vertical mobility is still a possibility.\nRichard V.

And in \n\u2013 a book which grew out of his widely circulated \narticle \u201c\n\u201d \u2013 he explains why and how we should deal with it.\n1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hoarding the Dream\nAmerica lives in a pretty strange reality: \n and looks as if he\u2019s just gotten out of a cartoon; even stranger, he is a multibillionaire supported by blue-collar workers!\n\u201cAt first glance,\u201d writes Richard V. Reeves, \u201cTrump\u2019s success among middle-class whites might seem surprising, given his own wealth. But his movement was about class, not money. Trump exuded and validated blue-collar culture and was loved for it.\u201d\nWhy, you ask?\n, it is because \u2013 to the dismay of Liberal Democrats and Socialists \u2013 Trump\u2019s supporters, as poor as they may be, have no problem with the fabulously rich. \nOn the contrary, in fact: they admire them excessively because they\u2019ve become what they are \n the fact that they look like cartoon characters; they see the ultra-rich as the embodiment of their most intimate dreams.\n\u201cThe enemy,\u201d writes Reeves, \u201cis the upper-middle-class professionals: journalists, scholars, technocrats, managers, bureaucrats, the people with letters after their names. You and me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd here is the difficult part,\u201d he goes on:\n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Class Apart\nThe criticism against the top 1% of the population is so commonplace nowadays that there\u2019s really no reason to go over the main points yet again.\nBut you know why is that?\nBecause it both comes from the direction \u2013 and communicates with \u2013 \n: the 19% just below that top 1% of the population, i.e., the upper middle class, aka a large mass of people who are actually doing pretty well in life. \nNo wonder why the majority of the bottom 40% (the \n 40%!) are not convinced!\nHere\u2019s a great example: according to Adam Levine, \u201cmore than a third of the demonstrators on the May Day \u2018Occupy\u2019 march in 2011 had annual earnings of more than $100,000.\u201d\nNow, don\u2019t get Reeves wrong: he\u2019s all about taxing the ultra-rich and limiting their potential to amass fabulous amounts of wealth at the expense of the poorest.\nBut, he\u2019s also for extending the definition of what it means to be rich.\nBecause, according to stats, the upper middle class not only earns a lot more than the 80% of people below it, but it is also the one who reaps the benefits of progress:\nOf course, more money means more freedom, better education and far better health: the top 20% smoke less, exercise more and live much longer than the rest of the population.\nNo wonder the rest feel like \n.\n3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Growing Gains\nTo say the least, \u201cfor those of us in the American upper middle class, life is pretty good.\u201d\nWe enjoy the advantages well beyond our bank balances: \u201cskills and education; control over our working life; the quality of our neighborhoods; ability to plan confidently for the future; our health, diet, and life spans; the stability of our families; and so on.\u201d\nHowever, there\u2019s one privilege we enjoy that quite possibly tops each of the above because it is \u201cthe one most dangerous to the American ideal of equal opportunity.\u201d\nNamely, how we raise our kids. \n\u201cIn the modern economy,\u201d writes Reeves, \u201chuman capital has become vital for success. The most educated and affluent parents got the memo. Upper-middle-class families have become greenhouses for the cultivation of human capital. Children raised in them are on a different track than ordinary Americans, right from the very beginning.\u201d\nIn other words, a typical child born and raised in the American upper middle class is privileged to live, on average, in a stable home and to be raised by married and well-educated parents.\nIn addition, this child is fortunate enough to live in a great neighborhood, which, \n, may contribute to about half of his skills and IQ.\nEven more: this child is able to go to that area\u2019s best schools which are far better than the schools located in bad neighborhoods; as a result, this child should eventually develop \u201ca wide range of skills and gain an impressive array of credentials.\u201d\n4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inheriting Class\nOK, the upper middle class is privileged, you say, but that may be the bottom 80%\u2019s fault. \nAfter all, they live in the land of the free and the home of the brave; if he/she wants, anyone can move upward the social ladder in the US!\nThat\u2019s not true, but let\u2019s just say it is; contrary to many articles and studies, let\u2019s just say that the US is egalitarian when it comes to opportunities, and that vertical mobility is a thing for just about every single citizen of the US.\nThe problem?\nEven if that is the case, those who are up almost never come down. \u201cRather than a poverty trap,\u201d writes Gary Solon, \u201cthere seems to be more stickiness at the other end: a \u2018wealth trap\u2019 if you will.\u201d\nIn other words, there are many Horatio-Alger-like rags to riches stories floating around; but, how many riches-to-rags stories do you know?\nThe graphic below shows that the answer is probably \u201cnot that many\u201d:\nNow, why is this important?\nBecause \u201cit is a stubborn mathematical fact that, at any given time, the top fifth of the income distribution can accommodate only 20 percent of the population. Relative intergenerational mobility is necessarily a zero-sum game. For one person to move up the ladder, somebody else must move down.\u201d\nThe problem, in other words, is not just class separation, but class perpetuation. And the solution is the wildly unpopular idea of downward mobility.\nSay what you will, but that may be the very reason why you\u2019re rich now.\n.\n5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Market Merit\n\u201cAmerica,\u201d writes Reeves in the very first sentence of this chapter, \u201chas a meritocratic market but an unfair society.\u201d\nIn other words, the market works the way it should work, rewarding those who are better skilled and have competitive advantages over the rest.\nThe problem is \u2013 as the previous two chapters have already implied \u2013 that some have competitive advantages from the very outset.\nThat\u2019s why the main challenge that lies before America is narrowing the gaps in human capital formation in the first two decades of life.\nPut quite simply, an upper-middle-class child is bound to have better education and more capital to start with \u2013 not to mention facing less judgment and discrimination \u2013 when the actual market race starts.\nSo, we have meritocracy with no mobility which means that the market rewards fairly the ones who have an unfair advantage.\n\u201cThe playing field may be level,\u201d sums up the argument Chris Haynes in \n,\n\u201cbut certain kids get to spend nights and weekends practicing in advance of the competition\u2026 the pyramid of merit has come to mirror the pyramid of wealth and cultural capital.\u201d\nWant to put an end to that?\nRead ahead! \n6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Opportunity Hoarding\nThe upper-middle-class children are not ahead when the market race starts merely because of their unfair advantages gained through inheritance; they are also ahead because their parents have hoarded opportunities, practically stealing them from the rest.\nThree opportunity hoarding mechanisms stand out in particular:\n\u2022 exclusionary zoning in residential areas; \n\u2022 unfair mechanisms influencing college admissions, including legacy preferences;\n\u2022 the informal allocation of internships.\nIn other words, the game is rigged in favor of the ones who are in a position to rig it:\n7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sharing the Dream\n\u201cI don\u2019t intend to set out a comprehensive, detailed manifesto,\u201d writes Reeves in the introduction to the seventh chapter of \n. \u201cInstead, I propose seven steps that we can and should take.\u201d\nHere they are:\n#1. Reduce unintended pregnancies through better contraception;\n#2. Increase home visiting to improve parenting;\n#3. Get better teachers for unlucky kids;\n#4. Fund college fairly;\n#5. Curb exclusionary zoning;\n#6. End legacy admissions;\n#7. Open up internships.\nAs you can see, the objective of the first four of these seven steps is to make the preparation for the market contest more even; the goal of the other three is to reduce anticompetitive behaviors.\nThe aim of all of them: to make life a little bit fairer.\n8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Check Our Privilege\nIn the final, concluding chapter of \n, Reeves explains that the reason why he got his American passport was fairly simple: \u201cthe nation\u2019s spirit of openness and promise of social equality.\u201d\n\u201cI always hated the snobbery and class distinctions of the United Kingdom,\u201d he goes on. \u201cBut the harder I have looked at my new homeland, the more convinced I have become that the American class system is hardening, especially at the top. It has, if anything, become more rigid than in the United Kingdom. The main difference now is that Americans refuse to admit it.\u201d\nIt\u2019s time that we do.\nHighlight on the \u201cwe\u201d if you\u2019re an upper-middle-class kid. \nKey Lessons from \u201cDream Hoarders\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0America Has Become a Class-Based Society\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Upper Middle-Class Rigs the Market and Hoards Opportunities\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seven Ways to Share the American Dream \u2013 If You Earn More than $100,000 a Year\nAmerica Has Become a Class-Based Society\nAmerica has always prided itself in the fact that it is a free society of individuals. To be American, writes Reeves, is \u201cto be free to make something of yourself.\u201d\nHowever, in modern societies freedom is very tightly linked with money; and about 50% of American money is hoarded by the wealthiest 1% of the population.\nIt gets even worse: 90% of the total wealth is held by one-fifth of Americans.\nReeves\u2019 book is directed at the 19% who refuse to admit that they are rich and privileged \u2013 and, that way, make life unbearable for the 80% that remains. \nThe Upper Middle-Class Rigs the Market and Hoards Opportunities\nSo, in a way, America has become exactly what Marxists have always blamed it on being: a class-based society.\nHowever, as Trump\u2019s victory at the 2016 election demonstrated, \u201cthe real class divide is not between the upper class and the upper middle class: it is between the upper middle class and everyone else.\u201d\nWhy?\nBecause the upper-middle-class children live healthier and longer, and in better families and affluent neighborhoods, and are privileged to go to better and more success-prone schools.\nWhat\u2019s worse, their parents \u2013 say, through exclusionary zoning in residential areas and legacy college admissions \u2013 make a place there only for other parents such as them, thereby hoarding opportunities from the rest.\nSeven Ways to Share the American Dream \u2013 If You Earn More than $100,000 a Year\nIf you are a member of the upper-middle-class and you\u2019re reading this, then Reeves\u2019 letter is for you:\nAnd there are seven ways we can do this:\n#1. Reduce unintended pregnancies through better contraception;\n#2. Increase home visiting to improve parenting;\n#3. Get better teachers for unlucky kids;\n#4. Fund college fairly;\n#5.

And Why?\nWell, it\u2019s a given that you need to be a Christian to have any relation whatsoever to this book.\nBut, then again, that may also be a problem, especially if you are a Protestant strictly adhering to the \ndoctrines.\nYou\u2019ll see why.\nAbout Sarah Young\n is an American Christian author.\nAfter receiving her formal education in counseling and biblical studies from the Covenant Theological Seminary in St. Louis, Sarah worked with her husband Steve as a missionary first in Japan and then in Australia.\nShe has written many books so far, including \n, etc.\nHowever, she\u2019s most famous for \n, a book which has sold over 25 million copies worldwide.\n\u201cJesus Calling PDF Summary\u201d\nis a daily devotional \u2013 which means it consists of 366 messages which should help you go through every day of a calendar year while having God by your side throughout.\nConsequently, it\u2019s impossible to summarize the contents of the book.\nHowever, it is very possible to summarize Sarah Young\u2019s introduction which casts more than bright light on everything else you can read inside \n.\nIntimations of God #1: \u201cSweet Jesus\u201d\n\u201cI first experienced the Presence of God in a setting of exquisite beauty,\u201d writes Sarah Young in the first sentence of \n\u2013 and you already know that this is either a deeply spiritual book written by a true believer or a somewhat quirky volume compiled by an eccentric.\n(We\u2019ll let you be the judge for now.)\nAnyway, Sarah Young, the daughter of a college professor, was living and studying at a Christian community in a tiny Alpine village in France at the time and, to use her words, \u201cwas free to explore the fairyland-like environment all around\u201d her.\nAnd so she did.\nEvery day she would climb a steep heel to attain a panoramic view of \u201cunbroken beauty,\u201d which included everything from a high-steepled church through the sun-bathed Lake Geneva to the icy tips of the Alps.\nAnd then, one night:\nTo tell you the truth, if we ever get the chance to experience something similar, we might just as well feel what Sarah Young felt.\nBut the story doesn\u2019t end there.\nIntimations of God #2: \u201cAn Overwhelming Presence\u201d\nThe following year, Sarah Young went back to the United States to work as a technical writer in Virginia.\nOne day, her boss sent her to Atlanta to attend a relevant conference; Young accepted the assignment, but she did so without any enthusiasm or wish to go through with it.\nYou see, at the time, she was \u201cgrieving the loss of a serious dating relationship,\u201d and, as you (unfortunately) know full well, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re interested in anything (let alone conferences) at times such as these.\nIn fact, in Young\u2019s words, it was the other way around: she was even starting to wonder whether there\u2019s any point in being a Christian or, even more, a believer.\nIncapable of overcoming the solitude and the darkness of her hotel room, Young began aimlessly walking the streets of Atlanta and came across a bookshop.\nShe was suddenly drawn to a specific book: \nby Catherine Marshall.\nNaturally, she bought it and spent the whole night reading it.\n\u201cI no longer felt alone,\u201d she writes. \u201cI knelt beside the bed in that sterile room and felt an overwhelming Presence of peace and love come over me. I knew Jesus was with me and that He sympathized with my heartache. This was unquestionably the same \u2018Sweet Jesus\u2019 I had met in the Alps.\u201d\nPresence-Less Sixteen Years\n\u201cDuring the next sixteen years,\u201d Young goes on, \u201cI lived what many people might consider an exemplary Christian life.\u201d\nWhat does this mean?\nWell, first of all, earning a master\u2019s degree in counseling and biblical studies from the Covenant Theological Seminary in St. Louis.\nThere Young met her husband, Steve, a third-generation missionary to Japan. \nAfter graduation, she joined him and spent the next eight years in Japan, doing church-planting work; in the meantime, the couple had two children: a girl and a boy.\nAfter Japan, Steve and Sarah returned to the U.S. where they spent the next three years. While Steve was working at a local Japanese church, Sarah earned a further degree in counseling at Georgia State University.\nAs part of her training, she worked at a Christian counseling center in the Atlanta area. \nAnd everything seemed perfect: Sarah had a loving husband, two delightful children, a chance to help \u201cdeeply wounded women find healing in Christ.\u201d\n\u201cHowever,\u201d she concludes, \u201cnot once during those sixteen years did I vividly experience the Presence of Jesus.\u201d\nThe Beginning of a New Quest\nIn the summer of 1990, Sarah Young began reading a devotional book\n by Andrew Murray. \nThe book helped her persist through \u201ca very unstructured time\u201d in her life, during which Sarah underwent four surgeries (two for melanoma), had to quit her job and had to incessantly wait with her husband for approval for their Australian visas.\n\u201cIn the midst of those momentous changes,\u201d she writes, \u201cI began seeking God\u2019s Presence in earnest. My days started alone with God, equipped with Bible, devotional book, prayer journal, pen, and coffee. As I waited in His Presence, God began to reveal Himself to me. An hour or two alone with Him seemed too brief.\u201d\nFinally, the visas arrived, and Steve and Sarah went to Australia, where Sarah was supposed to counsel hurt and abused Australian women and introduce them to the ways of Christ.\nThe pain to hear these stories was almost unbearable, so Sarah prayed for protection each and every day.\nOne morning, as she prayed, she visualized God protecting her and her family, encircling them with His Protective Presence which materialized in the form of golden light and the feeling of profound peace. \u201cI lost all sense of time as I experienced God\u2019s Presence in this powerful way,\u201d says Sarah. \u201cI had not sought the experience, but I received it gratefully and was strengthened by it.\u201d\nThere was, of course, a reason for this event: just three days later, Sarah had to counsel a client, an incest survivor, who had been abused in several Satanic rituals.\nShe was able to endure it all: she knew that God\u2019s light was above her.\nFirst Message from God\nIn 1992, Sarah Young began to read a book which directly influenced this one.\nTitled \n, this was a devotional book written by two anonymous \u201clisteners\u201d \u2013 women who decided to record the messages they had received from God. \nIn the book, the messages are written in the first person, as in every single \u201cI\u201d in \n designates God. \nNow, back to the quotation marks around the word \u201clisteners\u201d above.\nWe wonder: if these two anonymous women were actually able to listen to God\u2019s messages, aren\u2019t they listeners \n the quotation marks? Moreover, if they weren\u2019t, aren\u2019t they frauds?\nSarah didn\u2019t ask herself these questions; and, in a way, that implies that she believes the former. So, God apparently didn\u2019t just shut up when He finished dictating the Bible.\nAnd this is where things get really strange!\nIn 1993, Sarah Young began to wonder if she could, too, receive messages during her times of communing with God. \n\u201cI had been writing in prayer journals for years,\u201d she informs us, \u201cbut that was one-way communication: I did all the talking. I knew that God communicated with me through the Bible, but I yearned for more. Increasingly, I wanted to hear what God had to say to me personally on a given day.\u201d\nSo, Sarah decided to listen to God with pen in hand, writing down whatever she \u201cbelieved He was saying.\u201d\nAnd, voil\u00e0: \u201cI received a message,\u201d Sarah says without even realizing what that actually means. \u201cIt was short, biblical, and appropriate. It addressed topics that were current in my life: trust, fear, and closeness to God. I responded by writing in my prayer journal.\u201d\nNow, you\u2019ll have to agree: that\u2019s a pretty mundane thing to do after being visited by God Himself.\nMessages from God \u2013 366 of Them (At Least)\n\u201cMy journaling had changed from monologue to dialogue,\u201d goes on Young. \n\u201cSoon, messages began to flow more freely, and I bought a special notebook to record these words. This new way of communicating with God became the high point of my day. I knew these writings were not inspired as Scripture is, but they were helping me grow closer to God.\u201d\nA quick analysis of that paragraph:\n\u2022 Apparently, if you need to record God\u2019s words, you better use a special notebook for that (otherwise, He\u2019d be really angry!);\n\u2022 Communicating with God was the high point of Sarah Young\u2019s days (as opposed to buying the last bar of Snickers at a vending machine, we guess? Why would anyone need to point that out \n?);\n\u2022 God\u2019s words are sometimes not as inspired as other times (apparently, God\u2019s Muses are on strike since the days of yore \u2013 or, at least, not as inspired in English).\nJokes aside, one gets the feeling that Sarah doesn\u2019t realize what she\u2019s actually saying because she explicitly states that she \u201ccontinued to receive personal messages from God.\u201d\nAnd that:\nThe \n Devotional\nNow that you know how \ncame to be, it\u2019s time that we told you a bit about its actual content,\nAs we said above, just like \n, this book is a daily devotional, which means that it consists of 366 messages, one for each day of the year, apparently each of them coming directly from God via Young. \nYoung also includes Scripture references after each daily reading, because, as she says, as she listened to God, \u201cBible verses or fragments of verses often came to mind.\u201d\nShe uses some of them as epigraphs for each of the months.\nIf you are interested, these are the verses\n\u2022 \n: \u201cFor I know the plans I have for you,\u201d declares the LORD, \u201cplans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\u201d (Jeremiah 29:11)\n\u2022 \n: \u201cLook to the LORD and his strength; seek his face always.\u201d (Psalm 105:4)\n\u2022 \n: \u201cWhen he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.\u201d (\n 10:4)\n\u2022 \n: \u201cIn all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.\u201d (Proverbs 3:6)\n\u2022 \n: \u201cAscribe to the LORD the glory due his name; worship the LORD in the splendor of his holiness.\u201d (Psalm 29:2)\n\u2022 \n: \u201cFor I am the LORD, your God, who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, Do not fear; I will help you.\u201d (Isaiah 41:13)\n\u2022 \n: \u201cTherefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.\u201d (Romans 8:1)\n\u2022 \n: \u201cWhoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him.\u201d (John 7: 38)\n\u2022 \n: \u201c. . . I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.\u201d (John 8:12)\n\u2022 \n: \u201cCome to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.\u201d (Matthew 11:28)\n\u2022 \n: \u201cAnd my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus.\u201d (Philippians 4:19)\n\u2022 \n: \u201cFor to us a child is born\u2026 And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\u201d (Isaiah 9:6)\nJust so that you can get the feeling of Sarah\u2019s (or God\u2019s) style, we\u2019ve chosen for you an example message, the daily devotional for February 21\n, the date when \n.\nHere it is, in its entirety:\nThe message is followed by three verses taken from the Bible: Colossians 2:6-7; Psalm 141:8; and 1 Peter 5:7.\nApparently, even God needs footnotes.\nKey Lessons from \u201cJesus Calling\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Young Found God in Times of Distress\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bible Is Inerrant \u2013 But Is It Enough?\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Daily Messages from God\nSarah Young Found God in Times of Distress\nAs Sarah Young writes in the introduction to \n, she experienced God\u2019s Presence only in times of distress; for some reason, when things were going well, Jesus didn\u2019t appear to her.\nThat\u2019s why she has written this book: so that you can grow your love to God even when it seems that He has forgotten you.\nThe Bible Is Inerrant \u2013 But Is It Enough?\n\u201cThe Bible is, of course, the only inerrant Word of God,\u201d writes Sarah Young in \nAnd yet, it seems that it wasn\u2019t sufficient since she had to find a more personal way to communicate with God.\nShe even says this explicitly:\n\u201cI knew that God communicated with me through the Bible, but I yearned for more.\u201d\nAnd she got more: daily messages from God Himself.\n\u201cI knew these writings were not inspired as Scripture is,\u201d Young says, \u201cbut they were helping me grow closer to God.\u201d\nSo, apparently, \nis both more than the Bible and less than it at the same time.\nJust sayin\u2019.\nDaily Messages from God\nThe messages from \n\u201care meant to be read slowly, preferably in a quiet place,\u201d writes Young.\n\u201cThemes of thankfulness and trust recurred often during my listening times,\u201d she goes on. \u201cThese themes are quite prevalent in the Bible, and they are essential if we are to enjoy Jesus\u2019 Presence and Peace.\u201d\nConsequently, most of the devotionals are written in such a manner; and they\u2019ll probably help you if you suspense your (dis)belief for some time.\nAnd realize that humans sometimes can help other humans in profound ways.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cJesus Calling Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nTo tell you the truth, we don\u2019t know what to tell you about \n.\nThe book is not merely #1 Best Seller in the Inspiration & Spirituality category at Amazon \u2013 it\u2019s also one of the very few books which can boast an almost perfect 5-star rating with over 17,000 reviews.\nIt\u2019s an understatement to say that it is an accomplishment when 92% of your many, many reviewers consider your book all but perfect.\nAnd yet \u2013 as far as we are concerned \u2013 this book is nothing short of blatantly blasphemous if you are a believer or downright miraculous if you are a scientist.\n, \u201cI don\u2019t think Young is proposing to add the book of Young after Revelation. But that is, in effect, what her writings are claiming.\u201d\nIn other words, if Young has actually heard God, then scientists should be doing studies on her; if she hasn\u2019t, then she\u2019s lying (so unchristian).\nAs always, we are skeptics, so, 17,000 reviewers aside, we really don\u2019t think that you should bother with this book; even if you are a believer."},

And Why?\nis yet another manual for reading, not unlike Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren\u2019s classic \nand its more modern companion, \nby Thomas C. Foster.\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with either one of these three; though Francine Prose\u2019s book is more personal than the other two, all of them are so great that we firmly believe that they might just work.\nAbout Francine Prose\n is an American novelist, essayist, and critic.\nVisiting Professor of Literature at Bard College and a former president of the PEN American Center, she has authored 16 works of fiction and 8 nonfiction books.\nProse\u2019s novel, \n, was a finalist for the National Book Award, and \nwon the Dayton Literary Peace Prize.\nProse is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\u201cReading Like a Writer PDF Summary\u201d\nSubtitled \u201cA Guide for People Who Love Books and for Those Who Want to Write Them,\u201d Francine Prose\u2019s \nis essentially a Reading 101 textbook for everyone who wants to become a poet or a novelist \u2013 or thinks that he/she is one at the moment.\nA sort of a personal journey through the world of books (and especially those who made Prose the writer that she is today), the book is filled with examples from literary masterworks and even includes a list of \u201cbooks to be read immediately\u201d for anyone interested at the end.\nLet\u2019s summarize it, chapter by chapter (each of which deals with a different aspect of the writing craft, starting with words and ending with, well, the master of masters, \n).\nChapter One: Close Reading\nDo you know how most of the great artists you\u2019ve grown to admire throughout the years acquired and perfected their craft?\nThe simplest answer: they spent years studying and imitating the works of their predecessors.\nSo why should literature be any different?\nInstinctively, it may be not.\nAfter all, children read slowly, mouthing almost every word they encounter upon a page. Unlike them, adults seem to only know how to read fast.\n!\nIn Prose\u2019s belief \u2013 which we full-heartedly share \u2013 the difference between a slow reader and a fast one is the difference between a refined gourmet and a junk-food eater.\nSimply put, you won\u2019t feel all the flavors in the latter-case scenario, and, to use another analogy we\u2019ll get back to in our summary of the last chapter, you\u2019ll probably mistake a rose for a weed.\nThe solution?\nPay closer attention. \nApproach great books as you would riddles: \n, meaning their authors want you to break some sweat and discover at least some of them, the way Redditors do when they hunt for TV show\u2019s Easter eggs.\nFor example, \n and, especially, \nare much, much better books if, in addition to the story, you focus on the motifs of blindness and seeing.\nProse experienced this when she was a 16-year-old student given this very assignment.\n\u201cIt was fun to trace those patterns and to make those connections,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt was like cracking a code that the playwright had embedded in the text, a riddle that existed just for me to decipher.\u201d\nSuddenly, the \u201creading better makes you a better writer\u201d idea doesn\u2019t sound that strange, does it?\nChapter Two: Words\nThere are hundreds of thousands of words in the English language.\nAbout half a million according to Wikipedia.\nHow much is that, you wonder?\nWell, consider the fact that the full number of entries in the multi-volume \n is merely a half of that.\nWhy is this important?\nWell, because \n and not paying close attention to all of them \u2013 aka skim-reading them \u2013 is not too dissimilar from listening just the first minute of a song, then skipping to the third one and listening to a few seconds and then to the last 20 seconds.\nIn Prose\u2019s words:\nIn other words, if you want to read \u2013 read \n of the words.\n, there are countless of word-combinations and, for some reason, some authors have made the decision to use a certain one (and not another).\nYour job?\nCompel yourself to reading each and every word on a page by asking yourself what sort of information each word \u2013 i.e., each word choice \u2013 is conveying.\nIt\u2019s slow \u2013 we know.\nBut \nthe point.\nChapter Three: Sentences\nNow, words form sentences, so the next level of reading is that of the sentence.\n\u201cThe well-made sentence,\u201d writes Prose, \u201ctranscends time and genre. A beautiful sentence is a beautiful sentence, regardless of when it was written, or whether it appears in a play or a magazine article.\u201d\nBut how you should find one, or, if you are a writer, compose one?\nIs it supposed to be a short one or a long one? Does it need to be alliterative and lyrical or impartial and, to use a word \n famously uses in \n,\n?\nIf you\u2019re looking for a straightforward answer, don\u2019t look for it in this book! \nThere are numerous writers who became famous because of their mastery of short sentences (Hemingway being the most famous example) and many others who became the object of admiration because of their meandering, indescribably beautiful 100+ word sentences (Marcel Proust, we\u2019re looking at you!)\nAlso, there are some sentences which sound even more lyrical than verses (remember the concluding ones of \n), and some others which, though long and objectively written seem as clear and as precise as Hemingway\u2019s five-word sentences (Prose offers as an example the opening of Heinrich von Kleist\u2019s story \u201cThe Earthquake in Chile\u201d).\nBut, then, there\u2019s one thing you \n do to make your sentences sound sweeter and more majestic.\nRead your work aloud.\n\u201cChances are that the sentence you can hardly pronounce without stumbling,\u201d writes Prose, \u201cis a sentence that needs to be reworked to make it smoother and more fluent.\u201d\nAlso, if a thief breaks into your apartment while you\u2019re doing this, he/she will probably run away thinking you a madman.\nTrue story.\nChapter Four: Paragraphs\nIf words form sentences, sentences form paragraphs; and paragraphs are not merely the building blocks of a story, but also its DNA, the author\u2019s fingerprints on his/her work:\nNow, \n paragraph is not written by Prose, but by Rex Stout and comes from one of his \nmysteries; it is uttered by the detective Nero Wolfe when tasked with finding out if three manuscripts are plagiarized by one and the same person.\nApparently, in his view, they must be, because we write paragraphs too instinctively to falsify them; Proust believed that a writer\u2019s style embeds his/her vision of the world; and, style, Stout adds, is made of paragraphs.\nProse\u2019s piece of advice when it comes to paragraphs?\nThink of them as a kind of literary breathing.\nToo many short paragraphs make your text asthmatic; too many long ones will make your reader breathless (in the worst possible way).\nChapter Five: Narration\nOn to narration and narrators!\nThe best rule of thumb: use first-person or third-person narration and an \n narrator.\nNotice how we highlighted the word interesting?\nIt\u2019s because that\u2019s all it takes: the narrator needs to intrigue your readers, and it doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s someone you wouldn\u2019t hang out with in real life.\nIn fact, more often than not, these are the most interesting narrators.\nConsider the beginning of \n:\n\u201cLolita, light of my life, fire of my loins, My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta. She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita.\u201d\nNow, the speaker of these words is a lunatic enamored with an underage girl; in real life, Humbert Humbert probably belongs in prison.\nBut, in the world of literature, he\u2019s exactly the kind of guy you\u2019ll be interested in knowing more about.\nHe may be a lunatic, Prose says, but he is a \u201cbrilliant, inventive, self-dramatizing, self-mocking, obsessive lunatic genius.\u201d\nAnd who wouldn\u2019t want to get to know one when there\u2019s no danger lurking around the corner (except for papercuts)?\nChapter Six: Character\nUnless a peculiarity, a novel can\u2019t exist without characters, and the characterization of one can be done via one or all of these ways: through his/her actions, thoughts, and words.\nChapter seven is dedicated to the last of the three, and in this chapter, Prose compares the method of Heidrich von Kleist with that of Jane Austen to demonstrate how one can master the first two.\n\u201cAmong the unusual things about the way that Kleist creates his characters,\u201d Prose writes analyzing Kleist\u2019s novella \n, \u201cis that he does so entirely without physical description.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no information, not a single detail, about the Marquise\u2019s appearance,\u201d she goes on. \u201cWe never hear how a room looks, or what the latest fashion might be, or what people are eating and drinking. We assume that the Marquise is beautiful, perhaps because her presence exerts such an immediate and violent effect on the Russian soldier that he loses all control and turns from an angel into a devil. But we can only surmise that.\u201d\nIn a word, Kleist \u201ctells us just as much as we need to know about his characters, then releases them into the narrative that doesn\u2019t stop spinning until the last sentence.\u201d\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum, Jane Austen (\n), introduces us to her characters by telling us almost everything about them.\n\u201cIn Kleist,\u201d concludes Prose, \u201ccharacters tend to be defined by their actions. But Austen is more likely to create her men and women by telling us what they think, what they have done, and what they plan to do.\u201d\nChapter Seven: Dialogue\nHow many times have you heard literature professors and creative writing teachers advising you to clean up and polish your dialogue?\nFictional dialogue can\u2019t sound like actual speech, they say:\n\u201cThen why,\u201d asks Prose, \u201cis so much written dialogue less colorful and interesting than what we can overhear daily in the Internet caf\u00e9, the mall, and on the subway?\u201d\nYou know why?\nBecause of advices such as the one above.\nJust like psychotherapists, readers should train themselves uncovering secret meanings even beneath the surface of banal words.\nIf you feel like your character would use them \u2013 then let him use them.\nDialogue should always provide both text and subtext, \u201callowing us to observe the wide range of emotions that [your] characters feel and display, the ways in which they say and don\u2019t say what they mean, attempt to manipulate their spouses, lovers, friends, and children, stake emotional claims, demonstrate sexual interest or unavailability, confess and conceal their hopes and fears.\u201d\nYup: that much is at stake.\nChapter Eight: Details\nTrue, many authors (including Prose) claim that in a literary work, every word matters and counts. But they forget to add that it doesn\u2019t matter and count in the same manner.\nPut simply, some words reveal more than it seems that they do on the surface; however, others, reveal nothing, but are meant to leave a memorable impression of the \u201cwhy would this author mention something like this?\u201d\nHere\u2019s a great example:\nIn one case (Mark 8:22-26), Jesus makes a blind man see from the second attempt. The first attempt obviously fails, since, after it, the blind man of Bethsaida sees men \u201clike trees, walking.\u201d\nNow, many theologists ask (and this is called \n), why would Mark write something like that \n it wasn\u2019t true?\nRegardless of whether you believe in the Bible or not, a great answer is this: because the writer knew people would ask questions such as the one above.\nThat\u2019s what all liars know and, in a way, writers are not that dissimilar from liars.\nIf you want to be a good one, be mindful of the details \u2013 and include at least a few which would make your readers ask: \u201cnow, why would he/she mention something like this?\u201d\nChapter Nine: Gestures\nAnother important type of detail in a literary work is a character\u2019s gestures.\nFor example, consider the brilliant Katherine Mansfield short story \u201cThe Fly.\u201d\nIn it, the protagonist, called merely \u201cthe boss,\u201d is visited by a friend, Mr. Woodifield, who happens to inadvertently mention the protagonist\u2019s son\u2019s grave; the boss\u2019s son, we learn, was killed six years before this meeting in the First World War, \u201ca death the boss never mentions and tries not to think about.\u201d\nStricken with anguish, but (to his surprise) unable to shed a single tear, soon after Mr. Woodifield leaves, the boss notices a fly fallen into his inkpot.\nHe rescues it, watches it dry, and then drops a blob of ink onto it; and then, after some time, another; and then, finally, a third one; the fly struggles through it all, but is unable to survive the third drop.\nIt\u2019s easy to interpret this gesture over-simply, writes Prose: the boss\u2019s grief has moved him to do violence to a harmless fly. \nHowever, \u201cthe delicate shifts in the boss\u2019s emotions and his responses to the fly\u2019s struggle move us beyond this surface reading to consider the distractions of casual cruelty, the pleasures of playing god as a means of mediating one\u2019s own sense of powerlessness, and the perverse desire to pass pain on to anyone \u2013 anything \u2013 who is weaker and more helpless than we are.\u201d\nWhat a gesture, ha?\nHunt for such illuminative acts \u2013 and ignore all \u201cphysical clich\u00e9s.\u201d\nChapter Ten: Learning from Chekhov\nYou need a writer to learn from the craft of writing?\nThere\u2019s one: it\u2019s not Shakespeare or Tolstoy or Goethe or Dante.\nIt\u2019s Chekhov, the greatest short story writer of all time (according to many writers), one whose sentences will make you think that maybe things aren\u2019t so bad after all, an author whose works (and almost all of them, mind you!) are \u201cnot only profound and beautiful, but also involving.\u201d\nChekhov can teach you to write without judgment \u2013 i.e., be the unbiased observer \u2013 and to break the \u201crules\u201d of writing when rules are meant to be broken.\nPlus: there\u2019s no way you\u2019re not going to enjoy his short stories.\nAnd, quite perhaps, be irretrievably moved and changed by at least a few of them.\nChapter Eleven: Reading for Courage\nIt\u2019s scary to put yourself out there at the mercy and mercilessness of other people; that\u2019s why actors have stage fright, and that\u2019s why writers are afraid of the blank page.\nAnd then there\u2019s also the inevitable fear of pointlessness: to paraphrase Broch, is it not inhumane to care about whether the word you\u2019ve selected or the sentence you\u2019ve constructed is beautiful when there are about 2 billion poor people around today?\nAs far as Prose is concerned, you need to dispel those fears: there\u2019s always a point in planting more roses in this world.\nAnd reading is a way to see how other rose-growers grow their roses.\n\u201cIf we want to write,\u201d Prose ends her book, \u201cit makes sense to read \u2013 and to read like a writer. If we wanted to grow roses, we would want to visit rose gardens and try to see them the way that a rose gardener would.\u201d\nBooks to Be Read Immediately\nIn one final chapter, Prose includes a long list of book recommendations; there\u2019s no point in copying it here since you can find \n.\nSo, what are you waiting for?\nKey Lessons from \u201cReading Like a Writer\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Language Is the Medium of Writers \n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There Is No Such Thing as Fast Reading\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Slow Readers Make the Best Writers\nLanguage Is the Medium of Writers \nTrue, this lesson sounds both banal and trivial, but somehow it is still an \u201coddly underappreciated fact.\u201d\nWhy would Prose think that?\nWell, simply put, because if you really believed that words are to writers what notes are to musicians and paint is to painters, then you wouldn\u2019t read so fast!\nThere Is No Such Thing as Fast Reading\nHow do you know when you\u2019re really enjoying a song?\nWell, for one, you don\u2019t skip a beat.\nThat\u2019s what you do all the time when you\u2019re reading.\nThe truth is, if so, you\u2019re not reading \n.\nYou\u2019re actually just watching a movie on fast-forward, not immersing yourself within the experience nor actually learning anything.\nSlow Readers Make the Best Writers\nWant to become a better writer?\nWell, then, start reading slowly.\nSavor every word, analyze every sentence, follow motifs and symbols, jot down your notes on the margins of interesting paragraphs.\nAlso, read aloud every single word you\u2019ll ever write.\nIf it doesn\u2019t sound good enough when you hear it, then probably it isn\u2019t.\n\u201cI\u2019ve often argued that the only skill any writer needs,\u201d writes Oxford Professor of Poetry Simon Armitage \n,\n\u201cis the ability to see his or her work from the other side. That is, to put him or herself in the position of the reader.\u201d\nFrancine Prose feels pretty much the same.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cReading Like a Writer Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nis both a Reading 101 manual and a very personal love letter to books.\n\u201cProse\u2019s little guide will motivate \u2018people who love books,\u2019\u201d notes a New York Times book review. \u201cLike the great works of fiction, it\u2019s a wise and voluble companion.\u201d\n\u201cA jewel of a companion,\u201d adds \n.\nAnd they are more than right."},

And Why?\nDescribed by its author as \u201ca kind of psychological Agatha Christie,\u201d \nis more than just another thriller: it is \u201can unforgettable \u2013 and Hollywood-bound \u2013 new thriller\u201d (as pronounced by \n)\nIf you like detective novels and Hitchcock movies, Michaelides\u2019 book is the perfect blend of both; and you\u2019ll certainly enjoy it.\nAlex Michaelides Biography\n is an American writer and screenwriter.\nBorn to a Greek-Cypriot father and English mother in Cyprus in 1977, Michaelides earned an MA in English literature from Cambridge University and an MFA in Screenwriting from the American Film Institute in Los Angeles.\nAfter authoring the screenplays of two widely panned movies \u2013 \nand \n\u2013 Michaelides turned to writing.\nHis first novel, \n, has received rave reviews and will be adapted into a movie by Brad Pitt\u2019s production company, Plan B.\nPlot\nDescribed as \u201cthe perfect thriller\u201d by none other than \n, Alex Michaelides\u2019 debut \n novel, \n \u2013 is mainly narrated from the first-person perspective of \n, forensic psychotherapist.\nHowever, it is also interspersed with pages taken out of \n diary, a famous painter, the woman Theo is trying to help.\nEven though it can be argued that it doesn\u2019t do that much justice to this complexly plotted yet finely narrated and easily readable novel, we\u2019ll try to stick to this structure in our summary as well.\nSix Years Later\nSix years later, \n, a forensic psychotherapist with a history of addiction and an abusive childhood, informs us that, for reasons unknown, Alicia Berenson murdered Gabriel six years before the present day.\n(Unlike Theo, the dumbfounded readers know immediately that this happened around the time Alicia wrote the diary entry above).\nApparently, after shooting her husband five times in the face, Alicia was found by the police with a gun in her hand, trying to commit suicide.\nFrom then on, she stopped talking, never saying a word to anyone; the only thing of any note she managed to produce in the meantime was a single painting, a naked self-portrait enigmatically titled Alcestis.\nDespite the numerous attempts of the media to find out Alicia\u2019s motive, this is basically everything anyone knows about the night of the murder.\nAnd that\u2019s where Theo comes into play.\nDue to his abusive childhood and the fact that he was saved from insanity by his therapist (\n), Theo firmly believes that he can save Alicia.\nSo, he goes to the Grove, a mental asylum where, thanks to its head, \n \n, who advocated it as a better place for her than prison, Alicia Berenson is located at the present moment.\nHowever \u2013 and as expected \u2013 their first therapy session is a failure: Alicia is heavily medicated, and so, she is not even able to understand Theo, let alone engage in a meaningful conversation.\nTheo tries to look for answers elsewhere: he contacts Alicia\u2019s brother-in-law \n, and her aunt \n; to no avail: they refuse to speak to him as well; we guess it runs in the family.\nSpeaking of family \u2013 we learn soon after that Theo is married to a woman named Kathy.\nAnd he loves her very, very much.\nProblems in Paradise\nBack in the present, Theo asks Lazarus Diomedes to reduce Alicia\u2019s medication so that he is able to talk to her; Diomedes agrees.\nHowever, Christian, the head of Alicia\u2019s care team, is not that pleased: he thinks that Theo (whom he knows from a previous job) went behind his back; in the end \u2013 though reluctantly \u2013 he agrees to lower Alicia\u2019s dosage.\nThis bears some results: at the next therapy session, Alicia attacks Theo. In 99 out of 100 cases, that\u2019s a bad thing, but you know how psychotherapists are: even bad emotions are better than no emotions.\nTheo Faber is certain that a breakthrough is imminent.\nTo his surprise, Theo receives a phone call from \n, Gabriel\u2019s adopted brother, and Alicia\u2019s lawyer. He suggests to Theo that he contacts \n, owner of a small Soho gallery which represents Alicia.\nMax\u2019s wife \nhas another suggestion: talk to\n, she says to Theo on his way out. And \nis a cousin of Alicia, the son of her aunt \n.\neverything\nPaul Rose and Jean-Felix Martin\nBack in the present, Diomedes advises Theo to stop interviewing Alicia\u2019s family members \u2013 and to especially stay away from Max. \nThe Grove has problems staying open the way it is, Diomedes says, and angering a powerful lawyer such as Max will certainly not help them.\nUnfortunately, Theo cares more about Alicia than about the Grove.\nSo, naturally, the very next thing he does is paying \n and \n a visit; it is a completely unannounced one, so you can\u2019t blame Paul for knocking out Theo: he thinks that he is a burglar.\nHowever, things go pretty well afterward.\nAfter telling him that he hasn\u2019t talked to Alicia for years, Paul reveals to Theo that, in addition to Alicia\u2019s mother, her father, \n, had also committed suicide.\nQuite the family, ha?\nAnd you ain\u2019t heard nothing yet!\nAs Theo deduces from her words and behavior \u2013 by the way, she does chase Theo away angrily \u2013 both Alicia and Paul might have been abused by Paul\u2019s mother, Lydia!\nAnd Jean-Felix?\nWell, Theo visits him as well at the gallery and, in a brief discussion, realizes that Theo may be in love with Alicia\u2019s paintings much more than he was ever with her \u2013 as some of her family had initially suspected.\nJean-Felix suggests to Theo that he should read Euripides\u2019 play \n(By the way, a masterpiece.)\nArt Therapy for a Modern Alcestis\nAfter finishing Euripides\u2019 play, Theo realizes why Alicia has titled her last self-portrait Alcestis.\nIn the tragedy, Alcestis sacrifices her life for her husband Admetus \u2013 when not even his parents are willing to \u2013 only to be taken out of Hades by Heracles. However, after she comes back to earth, she remains completely silent.\nTheo explains to Diomedes that this must bear some relation to Alicia\u2019s life. She is metaphorically dead, he says, perhaps because she sacrificed a lot of things for her husband and he didn\u2019t reciprocate at the same extent.\nAnyway, since Alicia is not talking, Theo suggests that she undergoes art therapy. Perhaps, he now believes, she\u2019d communicate her thoughts better through her own medium: lines and colors.\nThe idea is accepted and, within a few days, it results in a strange painting: the Grove on fire, and Theo carrying Alicia in his arms in front of the asylum.\nIt is, however, difficult to comprehend whether Theo is saving Alicia or dragging her \n the flames.\nDuring a visit of hers, Theo gets acquainted with \n, Alicia\u2019s neighbor and friend. She learns during a second discussion that Alicia had confided to Barbie that she had a stalker, a fact apparently unknown to anyone else.\nnot\nThe Diary\nAt the Grove, Alicia stabs \n, one of the violent nurses there, with a paintbrush in the eye. From Elif, Theo learns that she did this after Elif taunted her by telling her that Theo was actually in love with her.\nOf course, the event puts an end to Alicia\u2019s art therapy sessions, and a ban on Theo\u2019s visits; Theo visits Alicia one final time to apologize for not helping her as much as he thought he would.\nAlicia\u2019s answer?\nShe gives him her diary.\nNow, Theo knows everything you know at this point.\nAnd, unlike you, he puts two and two together and realizes that Dr. West must be Christian \u2013 unlike you, he \n know his surname \u2013 and confronts him.\nChristian reveals to him that the meetings were secret and tells him everything he knows about Alicia; however, Theo decides that he is a bad doctor, and Alicia a much more honest person than him, so he goes to her and asks about Christian.\nAlicia is disappointed by the question and \u2013 surprise! surprise! \u2013 says nothing, so Theo visits the members of her family and close surroundings, one by one.\nThe only one willing to talk to him is Paul.\nAnd he tells him something which might reveal the true nature of Alicia\u2019s \u201cmetaphorical\u201d death.\nNamely, soon after Eva Rose\u2019s suicide, her husband Vernon asked Alicia why didn\u2019t she die instead of her mother.\nA great way to guarantee your daughter a lifetime of pain, don\u2019t you think?\nAnyway, after this discussion, Alicia said to Paul that Vernon had just \u201ckilled\u201d her. \nCould this explain Alicia acting all Alcestis for the last six years?\nAlicia Talks\nTheo storms to the Grove once again and tells Alicia the news; Alicia finally \u2013 after six years of silence \u2013 starts talking. \nSession after session (now that Alicia is talking, Diomedes allows the visits, \u00a0Theo learns everything he needs to learn about her childhood, which, if filmed, would be less believable than a Baron von Munchausen story.\nThat\u2019s how messed up it is!\nTo sum up for you (and for now):\nBoth of Alicia\u2019s parents killed themselves, and one of them might have even tried to kill her as well.\nIn the meantime, the other blamed her for this suicide and metaphorically killed her by asking her \u201cwhy didn\u2019t she die?\u201d\nAfterward, her aunt abused her and her cousin.\nTo make matters worse, when she finally got her life in order, her husband\u2019s brother professed her love for her and tried to rape her.\nAnd then a man started stalking her \u2013 something absolutely nobody believed her.\nOne day, Alicia finally opens up about the events which led to the murder of Gabriel.\nAccording to her, it was the stalker who had killed her husband, after tying her up and stealing Gabriel\u2019s gun.\nUnfortunately, this doesn\u2019t match the police report, so Theo is pretty sure that Alicia is lying.\nHowever, he doesn\u2019t get the chance to find out more, because the very next day Alicia falls into a coma, after overdosing with morphine.\nTheo angrily blames Christian for this and heads back home.\nThe Silent Patient Epilogue\nThe Truth About Kathy\nThe Final Diary Entry\nBefore passing out from the morphine, Alicia writes one final diary entry.\nIn it, she reveals that she had suspected Theo from the start, but it wasn\u2019t until later that she found out for sure that he was the stalker.\nAnd what a self-righteous stalker he was!\nApparently, on the night of the murder, Theo broke into the Berenson house and tied up the two spouses.\nAlicia begged Theo not to kill her husband, but after Theo asked Gabriel if he should kill him or his wife, he said \u201cAlicia.\u201d\nTheo merely pretended to have shot Alicia, firing a shot into the ceiling, but Alicia was already metaphorically dead \u2013 and for the second time.\nBecause unlike her and just like Alcestis\u2019 husband Admetus, Gabriel wasn\u2019t interested in sacrificing himself for her, meaning all his words of love were empty.\nSo, when Theo left, Alicia grabbed the gun and shot Gabriel five times in the face.\nThe Epilogue of the Epilogue\nIn discussion with \n, a consultant psychotherapist at the Grove, Theo reveals that it was never his intention for anyone to die.\nOn the contrary: he merely wanted Alicia to see the truth and seek out a better life for herself, for she had been in the very same position as him in his relationship with Kathy.\nHe came to the Grove to absolve himself from guilt, but also because he still wants to help Kathy, even though she is in a comma.\nDespite this, Theo is frustrated when he is unable to recover Alicia\u2019s diary, fearing that its updated version must hold incriminating information against him.\nTheo goes home to his wife Kathy who we finally meet her in the present.\nShe is not that unlike Alicia, a shadow of her former self, mostly silent and incapable of coming to terms with Gabriel\u2019s death; she has never admitted her infidelity.\nSuddenly, inspector Steven Allen arrives at the house of the Fabers. \nHe has Alicia\u2019s diary in his hands.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Silent Patient PDF Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nDeemed \u201cabsolutely brilliant\u201d by Stephen Fry and described as a \u201csmart, sophisticated suspense\u201d by the mind which gave us Jack Reacher, Lee Child, \nis not merely a promising start to a superstar career, but also its inevitable highlight, since it is oozing with \u201cthe pace and finesse of a master\u201d on every page (\n).\nWe enjoyed it, and we\u2019re pretty sure that you\u2019ll enjoy it too; in fact, we guarantee you that, once you finish it, you\u2019ll have a sudden urge to recommend it every book lover in your area.\nWanna bet?"},

Between 1990 and 2000, the annual average American workload increased by one week.\nBy 2014, when a travel company named Skift conducted a survey to find out why few people were buying travel packages, it was discovered that about 40 percent of the American workforce didn\u2019t even take a day\u2019s vacation that year.\nThis unhealthy culture of workaholism prevents us from having a good night\u2019s sleep.\nIn fact, according to a report prepared in 2010 by the American government, 30% of all employees have less than six hours of sleep per night, with nearly 70% describing their sleep as insufficient.\nAnd who suffers the most from it? The working poor. Workers in the lower classes often have several jobs to pay their bills, so they do not have the time to make sleep a priority.\nA 2013 survey by the University of Chicago found that a person\u2019s quality of sleep diminishes as his wealth decreases.\nAnd this causes drowsiness and can lead to various sleep-related illnesses.\nBeing overworked is not the only problem for the poorest. A professor at Stony Brook University has found that disadvantaged neighborhoods are also usually noisier, making it even harder to get a good night\u2019s sleep.\nAs a child, did you have trouble staying awake at school or wanted to take a nap at your table before starting activities? Well, this could have been a good solution!\nSleep deprivation begins very early when children are pulled out of bed to go to school before their bodies and minds are ready to wake up.\nIn 1998, a team of researchers from Brown University conducted a study on the effect of early school hours on children\u2019s health.\nThey found that children did better when school started at 8:15 in the morning, but then older children suffered from the schedule changes that required them to be in the classroom at 7:20 in the morning.\nThe researchers removed these children from the room at 8:30 and assessed their drowsiness.\nHalf of the children fell into a deep sleep only three minutes after lying down \u2013 a situation that usually only happens with people suffering from narcolepsy.\nStudents are pathologically tired when they are forced to get up so early every day to go to school.\nThis situation interrupts their natural sleep rhythm, the circadian rhythm.\nWhen students have better nights sleep, their performance improves.\nIn 2011, the Technion Institute of Technology in Israel found that the level of attention of its students improved considerably when classes started at 8:30 am instead of 7:30 am.\nA British high school in North Tyneside tried to take classes that started at \n, and their students began to earn better grades in exams.\nIn an episode of Seinfeld, George Costanza buys a custom-sized, foldable table that can turn into a bed at the push of a button.\nThe table allows him to sleep in the office without anyone knowing about it. Thankfully this kind of behavior is no longer needed in many modern workplaces.\nSome workplaces have the benefit of nap rooms so that employees can compensate for sleep.\nDespite the prevailing opinions, on the contrary, sleeping at work is not a sign of laziness.\nWhen nap rooms were introduced to the offices of The Huffington Post in New York, many officials were skeptical. Four years later, the rooms are constantly full!\nOther big companies like Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Zappos and Nike also followed the example of The Huffington Post.\nCompanies can promote healthy sleep habits in other ways as well. Such as ensuring that they have a sufficient number of windows.\nNatural light also creates a calmer atmosphere and is necessary for your body\u2019s biological clock.\nA 2014 study conducted by the University of Illinois, found that employees working in windowless offices lose an average of 46 minutes of sleep per night.\nWhy? Because our bodies need natural light to maintain circadian rhythms.\nAnd in addition to the nap rooms and windows, there are other ways to rest: sleeping at work or working from home.\nStaff sleep better and save time in transportation if they can sleep at work, so flexible office hours are very productive.\nAnd according to a Stanford University study on Chinese workers, working from home is even better!\nThe study found that employees who worked at home were about 13 percent more productive than those who only worked in offices.\nPeople believe that married couples have always slept in the same bed throughout history. But in reality, this custom arose at a time when few families could afford separate beds for each member.\nSo, should you and your partner sleep in separate beds if they can afford it? Not necessarily \u2013 sleeping together can also generate benefits by strengthening your relationship.\nAccording to a 2014 study at the University of Hertfordshire, 94% of couples who sleep with bodies in contact with each other are happy with the relationship.\nFor couples who do not sleep with the bodies in touch, that number is 68%.\nIn reality, the correlation between relationship satisfaction and sleeping near the partner is so high that the more distant the couple sleeps, the less satisfied they will be with the relationship.\nBut that does not mean couples need to sleep \n. It is more important that both of you sleep well \u2013 \n.\nThink about the stats again. The second number was lower, but still, means that 68% of couples who do not sleep together are happy with the relationship.\nThe important thing is that both partners have good nights of sleep, whether or not they are in the same bed.\nPartners who cannot sleep properly will rarely think about sex. In fact, a 2015 study found that a woman\u2019s desire for sex is directly correlated with her amount of deep sleep.\nFor every extra hour of sleep, there is a 14% increase in the likelihood that she wants to have sex on the same day.\nThe leopard is the earth\u2019s fastest land animal. Leopards can run 60 miles per hour in a matter of seconds \u2013 but they also sleep about 18 hours in a day to rest. Unfortunately, human athletes are not always that wise.\nPeople often believe that sleep deprivation is a good move in the sporting world.\nJon Gruden, one of the newest and most successful coaches in the National Football League or NFL, wrote a best-selling book called Do You Love Football ?!\nWinning with heart, passion and not much sleep.\nIn his book, Gruden takes pride in being one of the NFL\u2019s senior coaches if he considers his nights of sleep because he works for long hours.\nGeorge Allen, one of his rival coaches, boasted of sleeping in his office every night and working about 16 hours a day while sleeping only 4 or 5 hours a night.\nGruden and Allen are unaware that this type of sleep habit will only hurt their \n \u2013 and the performance of the players, who also need to get good night\u2019s sleep.\nIn reality, having good nights sleep can mean the difference between winning or losing.\nCheri Mah, a researcher at Stanford University, experimented on this phenomenon with basketball players.\nMah noted their performance on the court by measuring race times and success in three-point baskets.\nSo she rated each player again after they had slept 2 more hours per night \u2013 from 6.5 hours to 8.5 hours of sleep.\nHaving a rest at night allowed players to slow down the race time by 0.7 seconds and score nine extra three-point baskets!\nWhat\u2019s the last thing you do before bed? Do you watch an episode of House of Cards? Write some email? Do you read any news? These activities may seem like leisure, but make sure that you are not addicted to your electronic devices.\nToday, people are increasingly addicted to their gadgets, and a surprising amount of people take them to bed! According to the Consumer Mobility Report of 2015, 71% of people keep their cell phones close while they sleep.\nPeople are also more likely to get addicted to social networks; And this is especially bad for our sleep.\nHeath Cleland Woods, a sleep researcher at the University of Glasgow, found that people sleep worse when they are emotionally \n, and with that, they also suffer from anxiety.\nEmotions and stress are not the only problems with social networks; The blue light emitted by our devices also keeps us awake.\nThe light coming from the device screen suppresses our natural production of melatonin, a substance that helps us sleep. And that\u2019s part of why so many people stay awake beyond their natural sleep timings.\nAccording to psychologist Dan Siegel of UCLA, it is a vicious cycle. When darkness appears, the body usually begins to secrete melatonin, so much that we get to sleep within a few hours.\nHowever, according to Siegel, if you\u2019re staring at a device\u2019s screen all night, your body does not believe it\u2019s bedtime, even if it\u2019s late.\nWhen we finally try to sleep, we do not have enough melatonin to help us.\nSo if you want to have a good night\u2019s sleep, put your computer and phone away from you until 9 in the morning. Try reading a book!\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve taken away your computer and phone, but you still can\u2019t sleep; It may be time to try some more direct action. You may not know it, but jabbing a few needles in your ear can help you sleep!\nAcupuncture is an efficient and natural way to improve your sleep. People have used it for centuries, but now modern medicine already confirms its effectiveness.\nResearchers at Emory University conducted a research on ancient sleep studies and found that about 93% of research confirms that acupuncture is an efficient way to cure insomnia.\nAlso, several studies have found that ear acupuncture points are helpful in encouraging deep sleep.\nAccording to the Toronto Center for Mental Health, this happens because the stimuli at these points increase the production of melatonin and help reduce anxiety.\nIf you do not have time to visit an acupuncture practitioner, you can even try to apply pressure on your acupressure points.\nApply pressure on several spots on your wrist, ankles, and ears, and breathe deeply. Use your intuition. If you want to be more precise, you can seek the advice of a specialist.\nMedicinal herbs like lavender can also improve the quality of sleep.\nDioscorides, a physician from ancient Greece, wrote about the tranquilizing properties of lavender at the beginning of the first century.\nIt was widely used in ancient Greece and Roman baths to help guests relax.\nModern science has already confirmed the powers of lavender as well. It has already been proven that it can lower heart rate, lower blood pressure and skin temperature \u2013 another important factor to sleep well!\nSo you can try different herbs and aromas such as lavender or valerian root, and find out which oils work best for you.\nHave you heard of a technology that you can wear? We are not talking about T-shirts with screens or dresses with computer chips.\nWe are talking about devices that you use to monitor their biological functions \u2013 like sleep!\nThere are some technological devices currently available to improve sleep, such as intelligent sleep monitors and artificial light for sleep.\nA French company has created a system to improve sleep in 2014.\nThis system consists of two appliances, one that you should keep close to the bed and that controls the levels of noise, light, and temperature in the room. It also uses light and sounds to wake the person up when sleep is enough.\nThe second appliance should be placed under the mattress. It measures heart rate, breathing, and involuntary movements during sleep.\nWe have seen how blue light can be harmful to sleep patterns.

And Why?\nis both a heartfelt plea for honesty and a gentle appeal for a more personal connection to God.\nIn some ways, it reminds one of Bren\u00e9 Brown\u2019s books, especially her early ones such as \nand \nHowever, despite the universality of \n\u2019s message, the book feels as if exclusively addressed to believers and Christians; or, at least, in our opinion, those are the ones who\u2019d most enjoy reading it.\nAbout Lysa TerKeurst\n is an American writer and the President of Proverbs 31 Ministries.\nShe has authored about twenty books so far, four of which have made it to the top of the \nbestselling list: \nand \n \n.\nAn often-featured keynote presenter and a one-time \n guest, TerKeurst is also a recent winner of the Champions of Faith Author Award\nand\nis considered \u201cone of the leading voices in the Christian community.\u201d\nFind out more at \n. \n\u201cUninvited PDF Summary\u201d\nIn \n,\nLysa\nTerKeurst delves deep in her personal experiences of rejection (which includes everything from being shunned and hated by a lady at the gym to being abandoned by her father) to help readers fight it and live through it while feeling loved and accepted.\nAs she explains honestly \u2013 unlike other too confident people \u2013 she hasn\u2019t chosen the topic of rejection because she has mastered it or because she has overcome rejection in every way.\nShe has chosen it because she believes that digging into the core of who we are and exposing rejection\u2019s deep infection is important and is the first step towards healing yourself.\nExposing, she warns her readers isn\u2019t tidy; but it is honest, and it is good.\nAnd, in her mind, it is the only true way to God\u2019s embrace and His endless and unceasing Love.\n\u201cThe more fully we invite God in,\u201d she writes, \u201cthe less we will feel uninvited by others.\u201d\nDo You Still Want to Ignore Honesty?\n\u201cIn the quiet of an early morning,\u201d writes Lysa TerKeurst at the very beginning of \n, \u201chonesty finds me. It calls to me through a crack in my soul and invites the real me to \n. Not the carefully edited edition of the me I am this year.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she goes on, \u201chonesty wants to speak to the least tidy version of the woman I\u2019ve become. The one I can\u2019t make look more alive with a few swipes of mascara and a little color on my lips.\u201d\nAnd then she concludes: \u201cHonesty is a suitor with piercing vision who isn\u2019t swayed by pretending and positioning.\u201d\nUnfortunately, we go through life losing a bit of the real us day by day; you are one person at home, another one when you enter your office and yet a third one with your friends.\nWhy?\nBecause you want to protect yourself from pain; because every part of your unconscious works in such a way that should help you adapt more easily to your environment and \n the other way around; and, as days go by, you become a \n.\nEnough with that!\nTime to turn to yourself and listen carefully to the words your soul speaks; by definition, honesty will never attempt to hurt you \u2013 it will always try to heal you and help you chase away the lies which make you feel bad.\nWhy?\nBecause when you\u2019re honest \u2013 regardless of anything else \u2013 you are \n.\nOne God, Two Fears, and Three Questions\nAfter telling the sad story of her childhood (\u201cmy dad fed my fears every day,\u201d \u201c\n was not something that graced my dad\u2019s vocabulary\u201d), Lysa realizes that she owes the feeling of being \u201cthe unwanted one\u201d to a faulty interpretation of her relationship with her father.\nNamely, after her dad left her and her family \u2013 not that he had been emotionally around before that \u2013 Lysa came to an earth-shattering (but obviously wrong) conclusion: \u201cI don\u2019t matter. I am worth nothing to my dad.\u201d\nAnd an even more disturbing one: \u201cI fear I am worth nothing to God.\u201d \n\u201cThe sum of these feelings,\u201d she concludes, \u201cbecame my new identity.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re anything like us and about 90% of the humans inhabiting the planet, probably that\u2019s the way you\u2019ll interpret any rejection: it\u2019s not him/her \u2013 it\u2019s me.\nHow do you trick your brain into thinking the truth, how do you counter the many rejections that will undoubtedly come along your way and all the unpredictability of life?\nLink your identity to something permanent, something eternal, something unchanging, and something unquestionably loving and good.\nGod.\nHere\u2019s Lysa\u2019s mantra which helps her in the difficult moments of her life:\nOf course, it\u2019s one thing to say these \n, and a completely another one to live them out.\nHow do you do that?\nBy developing an \u201cintimacy-based identity,\u201d which starts with answering three core questions:\n\u2022 Is God good?\n\u2022 Is God good to me?\n\u2022 Do I trust God to be God?\nThe answer to all of these questions \u2013 and Lysa offers quite a few arguments taken straight from the Bible \u2013 is yes.\nGetting Out of the Rat Race\nEver since the Industrial Revolution, humanity has spent countless hours into trying to find ways to automate processes and earn itself some free time.\nThree centuries later, we can see nothing but the futility of this project: somehow, we have less free time today then we\u2019ve ever had throughout all known human history.\nIn a way, \n, we\u2019ve become hostages to our own progress: \u201cwe\u2019re still obsessed with growing, even when there\u2019s not much room left to grow in.\u201d\nLysa TerKeurst writes exactly the same: \u201cwe run at a breakneck pace to try and achieve what God simply wants us to slow down enough to receive.\u201d\n\u201cJesus doesn\u2019t participate in the rat race,\u201d she writes. \u201cHe\u2019s into the slower rhythms of life, like abiding, \ndelighting, and dwelling \u2013 all words that require us to trust Him with our place and our pace.\u201d\nA nice little fable sums up why you need to slow down to understand the meaning of life:\nEven science backs this: \n.\nTen Things You Must Remember When Rejected\nAs far as Lysa TerKeurst is concerned, the answer to the question \u201cWhat\u2019s a brokenhearted person to do?\u201d is a sentence which mentions God no less than ten times: \n\u201cWe must praise God, seek God, look to God, call to God, experience God, fear God, learn from God, honor God, draw near to God, and take refuge in God.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how many things she says you need to remember if you want to rise out of your own ashes when rejected.\nAnd here there are:\n#1. One rejection is not a projection of future failures.\n#2. Rejection doesn\u2019t label you; it enables you to adjust and move on.\n#3. This could be an invitation to live in expectation of something else.\n#4. There is usually some element of protection wrapped in every rejection.\n#5. It\u2019s good to ask the \u201cwhat\u201d questions but less helpful to ask \u201cwhy.\u201d\n#6. Don\u2019t hash, bash, or trash on the internet. Remember, the internet never forgets.\n#7. There\u2019s much more to you than the part that was rejected.\n#8. What one person sees as your liability, another might see as a wonderful asset.\n#9. This is a short-term setback, not a permanent condition.\n#10. Don\u2019t let this heartbreak destroy you. Let this breaking actually be the making of you. Let God use it in good ways to make you stronger and take you further.\nKey Lessons from \u201cUninvited\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Devilish Mechanics of Rejection: How a Line Becomes a Lie\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Benefits of an Intimacy-Based Identity\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ten Things You Must Remember When Rejected\nThe Devilish Mechanics of Rejection: How a Line Becomes a Lie\n\u201cRejection isn\u2019t just an emotion we feel,\u201d writes TerKeurst in the introductory chapter of her book. \u201cIt\u2019s a message that\u2019s sent to the core of who we are, causing us to believe lies about ourselves, others, and God.\u201d\nAnd how does this work?\nWell, you start by connecting a trivial event from today with something harsh someone said to you ages ago; let\u2019s say, someone hasn\u2019t answered your Facebook message yet even though the \u201cseen\u201d icon is there for hours.\nThis reminds you of a line, say the one your ex-boyfriend dumped you with: \u201cI don\u2019t want you.\u201d\nThe line, coupled with this new event, turns into a label: \u201cI am not accepted.\u201d\nAnd, before you know it, the label \u201cI am not accepted\u201d evolves into the lie you wake up with and the one that destroys all of your future friendships and relationships: \u201cI am not worthy.\u201d\n\u201cWe project the lines of rejection we heard from our past on others and hold them accountable for words they never said,\u201d concludes TerKeurst. \u201cAnd worst of all, we catch ourselves wondering if God secretly agrees with those who hurt us.\u201d\nSo, in a way, rejection steals the best of who you are by reinforcing the worst of what\u2019s been said to you.\nHow you should counter it: with honesty, brutal honesty.\nAnd with honest and profound faith in God and his love towards you.\nThe Benefits of an Intimacy-Based Identity\nIn TerKeurst\u2019s research on rejection and experience with it, she has discovered the two core fears that feed a person\u2019s sensitivity to rejection:\n\u2022 the fear of being abandoned;\n\u2022 the fear of losing one\u2019s identity.\nUnfortunately, every rejection makes both of these fears too tangible and too real to be easy to overcome rejection.\nHowever, TerKeurst sincerely believes that you can do it: the only thing you need to do so is God and a profound feeling of attachment to him.\nWhy?\nBecause when your impermanent and self-loathing identity is tied to something All-Loving and Eternal, you can remain the way you are as long as you live. And also: because then you\u2019ll never be completely abandoned.\nTerKeurst calls this \u201cintimacy-based identity,\u201d and she says that you can start building it by answering these three questions with a \u201cyes\u201d:\n\u2022 Is God good?\n\u2022 Is God good to me?\n\u2022 Do I trust God to be God?\nShe offers reasons for each of these three \u201cyeses\u201d by quoting verses from \n, with which \nabounds.\nRead them if you need a guide to these \u201cyeses.\u201d\nTen Things You Must Remember When Rejected\nThese may be the ten most important things you need to remember from this book \u2013 so we\u2019ll repeat them twice:\n#1. One rejection is not a projection of future failures.\n#2. Rejection doesn\u2019t label you; it enables you to adjust and move on.\n#3. This could be an invitation to live in expectation of something else.\n#4. There is usually some element of protection wrapped in every rejection.\n#5. It\u2019s good to ask the \u201cwhat\u201d questions but less helpful to ask \u201cwhy.\u201d\n#6. Don\u2019t hash, bash, or trash on the internet. Remember, the internet never forgets.\n#7. There\u2019s much more to you than the part that was rejected.\n#8. What one person sees as your liability, another might see as a wonderful asset.\n#9. This is a short-term setback, not a permanent condition.\n#10. Don\u2019t let this heartbreak destroy you. Let this breaking actually be the making of you.

in a way, she still is.\n\u201cWhat to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting PDF Summary\u201d\nQuite rightly dubbed \u201cthe bible of American pregnancy,\u201d \nis, perhaps, the most trusted pregnancy guide this side of the Atlantic.\nWith almost 20 million copies sold, it is certainly the bestselling one, and the most influential: it\u2019s not only consistently near the top of \nBest Seller list for a few decades, but it was also selected (back in 2007) by \nas one of the \n.\nUnsurprisingly, its author, Heidi Murkoff, was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the world by \nmagazine four years later.\nIn a few words, \nexplains everything\n\u2013 and we do mean \n\u2013 you need to know about pregnancy, from pre-conception through week-by-week growth to birth and beyond.\nThe book has gone through five editions, but please note that the summary below runs through the contents of the fourth one and the fifth one is revised.\nAlso \u2013 and more importantly \u2013 visit \n, the Internet home of the book, where you should find absolutely everything you need.\nOn a side note, this book may be the only reference book in existence adapted into a movie: even though there\u2019s no story whatsoever between its two covers, the 2012 same-titled blockbuster (starring everybody) is directly inspired by Murkoff\u2019s book.\nPart 1: First Things First\nUsually, people buy this book only after they\u2019re already pregnant, but that only means they should start the book at Chapter 2; because the first chapter is all about preparing for \u201cthe healthiest pregnancy \u2013 and baby \u2013 possible.\u201d\nHere you\u2019ll find preconception prep for both moms and dads so that both parents can \u201cget into tip-top baby-making shape.\u201d\nThe chapter also includes several conception misconceptions \u2013 you should definitely check them out!\nHere you\u2019ll read everything about early pregnancy signs and diagnosing pregnancy, as well as about testing for the irregular or about the reasons for a negative or a no longer positive result.\nIn addition, the chapter includes a section on how to smartly test yourself, birthing choices and making the most of the patient-practitioner partnership.\nIf you\u2019re like us, probably your first question is \u201cwhat the hell is a pregnancy \n.\u201d \nHeidi Murkoff defines it thus:\nAnd this chapter is all about your pregnancy profile, aiming to \u201chelp you take stock of your pregnancy profile and figure out how it may affect\u2014or may not affect\u2014your nine months of baby making.\u201d\nThere\u2019s absolutely everything here!\nFrom a section on birth control during pregnancy through a series of Q&A sections related to some gynecological conditions (fibroids, endometriosis, HPV, STDs, herpes) to everything about your obstetrical history and what to do if you\u2019re having a baby after 35.\nHere you\u2019ll read all about prenatal diagnosis, first-trimester ultrasound, and combined screening, and what to do if a problem is found. \nAs you know full well, pregnancy comes with adjustments in your everyday life.\nIf you\u2019re wondering just \u201chow drastically your lifestyle will have to change now that you\u2019re living for two,\u201d then start with this chapter.\nSports and exercise are still good, and you don\u2019t need to change that part of your lifestyle; you just need to be a bit more moderate.\nThe same holds true for caffeine, but it doesn\u2019t for drinking and smoking.\nIn other words, \u201cthere\u2019s just no research to support\u201d that either, even in small amounts, is a completely safe bet and the Surgeon General, the ACOG and the AAP advise that no amount of alcohol is safe for pregnant women, and that \u201cthat smoking during pregnancy, particularly beyond the third month, isn\u2019t just hazardous to your health \u2013 but to your baby\u2019s, too.\u201d\nOf course, saying that isn\u2019t the same as giving up on smoking completely, so in this chapter, you\u2019ll find advice on how to break your smoking habit and how to deal with secondhand smoke.\nDrugs are covered as well, and no need to say that all of them are strictly forbidden as well; yup, even marijuana.\nBy the way, this chapter also includes a section on \u201cComplementary and Alternative Medicine\u201d so be sure to check it out before trying any of the practices; some are good, but some may pose a risk to pregnant women.\n\u201cThe challenge during pregnancy isn\u2019t just to eat (though that may be challenge enough during those early months)\u201d \u2013 writes Heidi Murkoff at the beginning of Chapter 5. \u201cIt\u2019s to eat as well as you can.\u201d\nThink of it this way:\n\u201cEating well when you\u2019re expecting is one of the first and best gifts you can give to your soon-to-arrive bundle of joy \u2013 and it\u2019s a gift that can keep on giving, handing out not just a healthier start in life but a healthier lifetime.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re looking for healthy alternatives to your favorite foods, you\u2019ll find them here:\nWhatever you do, don\u2019t forget the \u201cNine Basic Principles for Nine Months of Healthy Eating\u201d:\n#1. Bites count.\n#2. All calories are not created equal. \n#3. Starve yourself, starve your baby.\n#4. Efficiency is effective.\n#5. Carbohydrates are a complex issue.\n#6. Sweet nothings are exactly that.\n#7. Good foods remember where they came from.\n#8. Healthy eating begins at home.\n#9. Bad habits can sabotage a good diet.\nMore or less, it all boils down to this: if you like something, but you think your baby won\u2019t \u2013 take the fork out of your mouth!\nNeedless to add, there are many more advises such as this in this chapter, amounting to a complete Pregnancy Diet Plan.\nPart 2: Nine Months & Counting: From Conception to Delivery\n\u201cCongratulations, and welcome to your pregnancy!\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s how the second part of \nbegins.\nIt\u2019s divided into nine chapters, but each of them is, in turn, divided into many sections, the first few of which describe everything that\u2019s happening in your stomach week-by-week during that month.\nChapter 6 is about the first four weeks, during which your body will be gearing up for the months of baby-making to come.\u201d\nThis is when \u201cyou\u2019ll notice changes in parts of your body you\u2019d expect (like your belly), as well as places you wouldn\u2019t expect (your feet and your eyes). You\u2019ll also notice changes in the way you live \u2013 and look at \u2013 life.\u201d\nHere, you\u2019ll find all about these early symptoms as well as about the ways to alleviate some of the negative ones (like fatigue and morning sickness).\nAs all of the chapters in this second part, this one too starts with an explanation of how your baby looks like this month and what you may be feeling.\nNext, it moves on to explain common nuisances at this stage, including heartburn and indigestion, food aversions and cravings, as well as visible, spider, and varicose veins.\nIt next moves on to some less common problems such as an achy, swollen pelvis, breakouts, dry skin and eczemas, mood swings, depressions, and panic attacks.\nIt also tells you everything you need to know about weight gain, from the normal rate of gaining weight to weight gain red flags.\nYou get the drill by now: your baby this month and your thoughts are the first things covered, and then everything that\u2019s the sign of normal pregnancy to everything that may go wrong.\nTopics covered here are constipation, diarrhea, headaches, corpus luteum cyst, stretch marks, and many others.\nSince this is the month when you may first hear \u201cthe amazing sound of your baby\u2019s heartbeat\u201d at the checkup, there\u2019s everything about that too.\nThe chapter also reveals a thing or two about your increased sex drive at this time, as well as about the uncomfortability of being a pregnant worker; a great thing about this book is that it also includes an introduction to your rights as a pregnant worker, as well as the outlines of a possible unfair treatment at work.\nOnce again, after the usual things are covered \u2013 your baby this month, what you may be feeling, a look inside, what you can expect at this month\u2019s checkup, what you may be wondering about \u2013 Murkoff moves on to the possible annoyances and problems.\nIt starts with dental problems and nasal stuffiness and nosebleeds, before moving on to topics such as vaginal discharge, elevated blood pressure, sugar in the urine, and anemia.\nFetal movement is also covered, as well as the topic of maternity clothes and \u201clooking slim when you\u2019re bulking up.\u201d \nHere you can also read all about why and how to exercise during pregnancy.\nMoving on: the fifth month comes with dizziness, backache, abdominal aches, foot growth, and fast-growing hair and nails; as scary as it may sound, it\u2019s only the usual.\nThere are many travel advices here, starting from the obvious (say, wearing a seat belt) to whether it\u2019s safe for you to travel by plane.\nMerely mentioned in the previous chapters, sex during pregnancy is here analyzed thorough, with all its benefits and setbacks.\nAfter finding out how your baby looks like in the sixth month and what you can expect at this month\u2019s checkup, Chapter 11 moves on to cover topics such as sleeping troubles, protruding navel, itchy bell, clumsiness, numbness in the hands and leg cramps.\nIt also covers some possibly more serious problems (\u201cwhen something just doesn\u2019t feel right\u201d), ranging from preeclampsia to bleeding.\nThe chapter also includes a section on childbirth education: whether you need it and what type would be preferable.\nThe third and final trimester means excitement and anticipation \u2013 but also multiplied pregnancy aches and pains.\nConsequently, Murkoff revisits some topics here \u2013 such as fatigue and lower back pain \u2013 while also sharing everything you need to know about kick count, fetal hiccups, and even accidental falls. \nIt\u2019s the eighth month, and it\u2019s time you learn something more about Braxton Hicks contractions, \u201cnot-so-funny rib tickling\u201d and the lack of bladder control. \nOther topics covered here include choosing a pediatrician, your weight gain and the baby\u2019s size, the baby\u2019s position, and all about cesarean delivery.\nThe eighth month is the perfect time to start learning more about breastfeeding \u2013 and that goes for the fathers as well! \n\u201cFinally,\u201d writes Murkoff. \u201cThe month you\u2019ve been waiting for, working toward, and possibly worrying about just a little bit is here at long last. Chances are you\u2019re at once very ready (to hold that baby \u2026 to see your toes again \u2026 to sleep on your stomach!) and not ready at all.\u201d\nThe ninth month is the longest month of all, and it\u2019s the most suitable one to read a paragraph on two about leaky breasts, urinary frequency, and due dates and overdues.\nFinally, Chapter 14 is the one in which you \u2013 and your partner \u2013 can find out all about prelabor, false labor, and real labor, including the symptoms for each and the right moment to call the practitioner.\nThe nine months have passed, you\u2019re into labor, and it\u2019s time you deliver your baby to this world. Don\u2019t panic: \nhas everything covered.\nChapter 15 includes sections on topics such as darkened amniotic fluid, irregular contractions, and emergency delivery.\nAnd many others, including fetal monitoring, artificial rupture of membranes, episiotomy, forceps, vacuum extraction, etc.\nIn a nutshell \u2013 once again \u2013 everything you need to know; might we add: maybe even more than that.\nPart 3: Twins, Triplets & More: When You\u2019re Expecting Multiples\nThe third part of \nconsists entirely of one chapter, and the chapter is entirely about what you may be wondering about when you discover that you\u2019re expecting more than one child.\nHere you\u2019ll read all about eating well with multiples, exercising properly, laboring with twins, twin timing, positioning, and delivering twins and triplets. \nPart 4: After the Baby Is Born \nAfter the baby is born, you\u2019re officially a mother, but you\u2019re also unofficially still on the pregnancy territory:\nWhether you\u2019re interested in how to deal with afterpains, delivery bruises, excessive sweating, or engorged breasts \u2013 you\u2019ll find everything here.\nThe chapter also includes a breastfeeding guide, covering everything from the basics and the appropriate diet, through medication and lactation to sore nipples and bottle babies. \n\u201cThough most of your questions and concerns are likely to be baby-related\u201d after the first postpartum week, \u201cyou\u2019re sure to have some that are a little more mommy-centric, too, from the state of your emotions (\u2018Will I ever stop crying during insurance commercials?\u2019), to the state of your sexual union (\u2018Will I ever want to do \nagain?), to the state of your waist (\u2018Will I ever be able to wear jeans that zip?\u2019).\u201d\nThe answers to all of the above questions are \u201cyes,\u201d but these are only a few of the many answered in this chapter.\nOthers include baby blues, postpartum backache, and workout rules for the first six weeks after birth.\nMy god, the information in this book is a little short of overwhelming: there\u2019s \n absolutely everything here.\nPart 5: For Dads\nSpeaking of everything: time for a chapter which should interest dads in particular.\nMurkoff addresses them:\nIn a way, she says that dads should really read the whole book through, but this chapter especially \u2013 which is not for the eyes only.\nHere dads can read all about how to deal with their partner\u2019s symptoms and how to survive her mood swings, and, of course, how to deal with their sex urges both during pregnancy and after delivery. \nPart 6: Staying Healthy When You\u2019re Expecting\nStaying healthy while you\u2019re expecting a child doesn\u2019t concern only you \u2013 it concerns your child as well.\nThat\u2019s what this chapter is all about, providing guides on what to do and which medications are safe to treat some of the most common diseases.\nThese are the diseases covered: the common cold, sinusitis, flu, fever, strep throat, urinary tract infection, yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis, stomach bugs, listeriosis, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, fifth disease, measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, Lyme disease, hepatitis A to C, and Bell\u2019s palsy. \nWhat about chronic conditions?\nDon\u2019t worry, there\u2019s a chapter for that too!\nAnd it answers all of the questions you might have about the most common chronic diseases \u2013 in alphabetical order!\nThe chronic conditions covered in this chapter are asthma, cancer in pregnancy, cystic fibrosis, depression, diabetes, epilepsy, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, hypertension, irritable bowel syndrome, lupus, multiple sclerosis, phenylketonuria, rheumatoid arthritis, scoliosis, sickle cell anemia, and thyroid disease.\nTo tell you the truth, we feel a little sick at the moment.\nBut we only got two chapters to finish our summary, so we believe that we\u2019ll make it through; after all, women go through this for nine months.\nSomehow, we now appreciate them even more.\nPart 7: The Complicated Pregnancy\nThe seventh part of \ndeals with complicated pregnancies; Chapter 22 goes through all of the possible problems, and Chapter 23 is a manual on how to get through if the worst-case scenario becomes a reality.\nHere, there\u2019s everything you need to know about miscarriages and a bunch of other things we know not one thing about.\nWe\u2019ll just list some of them (we repeat: some of them!) for those who do: ectopic pregnancy, subchorionic bleed, hyperemesis gravidarum, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, intrauterine growth restriction, placenta previa, placental abruption, chorioamnionitis, oligohydramnios, hydramnios, preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM), etc. etc.\nWe didn\u2019t even get to half; possibly because we don\u2019t really want to think about complicated pregnancies; may there be fewer and fewer with each passing second.\n\u201cPregnancy is supposed to be a joyous time,\u201d writes Murkoff in the introduction to this chapter, \u201cfilled with excitement, anticipation, and pink-and-blue daydreams about life with your baby-to-be (mixed in with a little normal trepidation and anxiety).\u201d\n\u201cAnd usually, it is all of those things, but it isn\u2019t always. If you\u2019ve experienced the loss of a pregnancy or a newborn, you know firsthand that the depth of your pain can be beyond words. This chapter is dedicated to helping you handle that pain and cope with one of life\u2019s most difficult losses.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cWhat to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Conception Misconceptions\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nine Rules for Nine Months of Eating Well\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pregnancy Is for Dads Too\nConception Misconceptions\n\u201cYou\u2019ve heard plenty of old wives\u2019 \u2013 and new Internet \u2013 tales about how best to make a baby,\u201d writes Heidi Murkoff in one of her thousands of lessons in this book (it\u2019s really ungrateful to choose only three).\nHowever, many of them are no more than myths.\nFor example, having sex every day \ndecrease the chances of getting pregnant: it may even increase them.\nAlso, wearing boxer shorts doesn\u2019t increase fertility and missionary is not the only position in which one can get pregnant: \u201cunless sperm have a motility problem, they\u2019ll reach their target no matter what position you\u2019re in while you\u2019re doing it.\u201d\nFinally, daytime sex doesn\u2019t help you conceive faster \u2013 it makes no difference \u2013 but there\u2019s no reason for you to act as if it does.\nNine Rules for Nine Months of Eating Well\nWe\u2019ve already shared them with you, but here they are yet again:\n \nTry to make your pregnancy bites count by choosing them (at least most of the time) with baby in mind.\u201d\nOr,\nin other\nwords,\n\u201c200 calories in a doughnut are not equal to the 200 calories in a whole-grain raisin-bran muffin.\u201d\nThat\u2019s pretty self-explanatory.\n\u201cGet more nutritional bang for your buck by choosing foods that are lightweights when it comes to calories, heavy hitters when it comes to nutrients.\u201d\nDon\u2019t drop unrefined (complex) carbohydrates from your diet.\nSugar calories are, sadly, empty calories and there\u2019s no sugary way to\ncircumvent the reality of it.\nOr, in case you don\u2019t, nature knows; you can\u2019t fool it.\nYour home should be a healthy food zone for the nine months of pregnancy \u2013 and that goes for dads as well.\nNo matter how healthy your diet, smoking and drinking alcohol will sabotage your efforts in no time.\nPregnancy Is for Dads Too\nTrue, mothers are the only ones capable of going through it.\nBut fathers can make things easier for them.\nSo, all you dads-to-be, stop scoffing at books such as \n: read them instead.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cWhat to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nSome of the usual reviews of \ninclude phrases such as \u201ca lifesaver,\u201d and \u201can incredible pregnancy resource,\u201d and descriptions such as \u201cwhat every mother can\u2019t do without.\u201d\nThe last one seems to be closer to the truth than you\u2019ll ever imagine: according to some relevant stats, 9 out of 10 pregnant women in the US who buy a book on pregnancy buy \n.\nThat statistic says it all, much more than we could or ever will be able to."},

And Why?\nIf you want to learn more about the history of USA\u2019s involvement in South Asia \u2013 there\u2019s certainly no better place to start than Srinath Raghavan.\nBe warned though: South Asia means \u201cIndia, Pakistan, and Afghanistan\u201d here; even though we can\u2019t suggest you titles, we\u2019re pretty sure that there are better books on US relations with Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.\nAbout Srinath Raghavan\n is a political commentator, bestselling author, and Senior Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi.\nIn addition to \n, he has also authored three books on India\u2019s security and foreign policies: \n, and \n.\nFor his work, Raghavan has received two notable prizes so far, the Infosys Prize for Social Sciences and the K. Subrahmanyam Award for Strategic Studies.\n\u201cThe Most Dangerous Place PDF Summary\u201d\nWhat This Book Is About in Short\n by Srinath Raghavan is perhaps the best book one could read if he or she is interested into finding out more about the history of United States in South Asia \u2013 India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan more specifically.\nAt more than 400 pages, the book covers almost every event of importance \u2013 and many practically unknown in the West (and, thus, even more significant) \u2013 from 1784 to 2018, both through the eyes of South Asians and, for the first time \u2013 via thousands of pages of declassified documents \u2013 through the eyes of the highest echelons of American politicians. \nAnd, in retrospect, these have been two pretty eventful centuries, during which American interest in South Asian countries has come a long way; particularly in relation to Afghanistan after the fall of the Soviet Empire, and, even more, in relation to India after 1947.\nYou\u2019ll find everything you\u2019re interested in here: from the first contacts of Americans \u2013 mainly missionaries and merchants \u2013 with South Asia to the history of the American alliance with Pakistan; from \n to the birth of Bangladesh; from the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan to \nAnd after 379 pages of history, in the very last of the ten chapters of \n(\u201cThe New Century\u201d), Srinath Raghavan turns to the most recent landmark events, covering everything from \n and the invasion of Afghanistan to the nuclear rearming of India and Pakistan.\nThe final point?\nAmerica\u2019s present interests in South Asia can\u2019t be understood without a little history; and, without it, USA\u2019s decision-makers will go on making the same mistakes over and over again \u2013 as they have already done quite a few times in the past.\nThe Murder of Mohammad Mansour\nIn a way, Srinath Raghavan\u2019s final point is merely the corollary of an even more important one: the USA keeps getting South Asia wrong and tries to correct its mistakes by making new ones.\nIn fact, that\u2019s how the book opens, with an analysis of the expected versus the actual effects of the murder of Taliban\u2019s then-leader Akhtar Mohammad Mansour via a drone attack in Pakistan, on May 21, 2016.\nWhen Barack Obama announced the killing at a press conference two days later, he hailed it as a victory, for two reasons: it was both the decisive \u201cpart of a strategy to bring Taliban to the negotiating table\u201d and an attempt to \u201csend a strong signal to Pakistan that it could no longer harbor Taliban leaders while pocketing American financial aid.\u201d\nHowever, the assassination delivered neither of these two desired outcomes.\nThe Taliban quickly chose Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzad to be Mansur\u2019s successor, and, under his leadership, Taliban attacks all over Afghanistan escalated. In addition, USA\u2019s relations with Pakistan worsened, because the Pakistani government denied claims that it had been harboring Taliban leaders.\nAs it was revealed about a year later, this was the truth: to say the least, the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) wasn\u2019t that fascinated with Mansur, and it might have been ISI the organization which created the trail that eventually led the Americans to Mansur.\nTwo years later, the USA\u2019s dealing with the very same problems, if not a bit worsened:\nThree Lenses of Analysis\nAs stated in the \u201cIntroduction\u201d Srinath Raghavan\u2019s \ntries to illuminate the history and evolution of America\u2019s interactions with South Asia \u2013 in addition to India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives as well \u2013 through three lenses.\nThis was the first thing which drove merchants of the young American republic to the Indian subcontinent somewhere near the end of the 18\n century.\nHowever, the interest quickly waned, since American capitalists realized that they have a continent-sized market at home, so they don\u2019t need another subcontinent for now \u2013 especially in view of the fact that, unlike theirs, \n.\nHowever, the times changed, and after the 1930s, American interest turned yet again to the Indian subcontinent; and this time \u2013 it was a bit more personal.\nAmerican businesses weren\u2019t just interested in profits and South Asia\u2019s markets anymore: they also \u201cwanted to preserve capitalism globally in order to ensure that the United States was not forced under an autarkic path.\u201d \nConsequently, financial interests were now both military and political \u2013 and it was difficult to distinguish where one of these ended, and another one began.\nFor example, \n, but the USA still provided financial aid for the country \u201cin order to ensure that it did not move into closer orbit around Moscow.\u201d\nOn the other hand, even though Pakistan\u2019s economy wasn\u2019t exactly thriving, the USA backed India\u2019s neighbor both politically and militarily \u2013 just in case India \n move from the bloc of unaligned countries into the Eastern Bloc.\nSpeaking of the Cold War\u2026\nThe second dimension of the USA\u2019s interests and interventions in South Asia is purely ideological.\n\u201cFrom the start,\u201d reminds us Srinath Raghavan, \u201ca religious belief in divine favor and a political faith in republican liberty have shaped American ideology.\u201d\nAnd whether we\u2019re talking about Thomas Jefferson\u2019s idea of \u201cempire of liberty\u201d or Barack Obama\u2019s avowal of the United States as the \u201cindispensable nation,\u201d the idea that the USA has a \u201cprovidential role in helping the spread of liberty has conditioned American engagement with the wider world.\u201d\nSouth Asia is, of course, not an exception:\n\u201cThe third major dimension of US involvement in South Asia,\u201d writes Raghavan, \u201cis culture, in particular, religion, race, and notions of hierarchy.\u201d\nNaturally, these were the first three things the Americans noticed after arriving on the Indian subcontinent.\nAnd as it has been demonstrated numerous times in the past, almost all of them were repelled by the primitive rituals and practices of the Hindus.\nIn view of them, the egalitarian notions of the Muslims seemed much more Christian, and, thus, \u201cmore comprehensible and palatable.\u201d\nThis shaped the American politics for much of the 19\n and the first half of the 20\n century: compared to the \u201cbeastly\u201d Indians and their outdated Hindu religious views, Muslim Pakistan and Afghanistan seemed like much more suited to be allies.\nThe paradox?\nEven though Americans \u2013 and Europeans \u2013 were appalled by the rigid social hierarchy of the Hindus, they based their judgment of South Asians on unscientific ideas of racial superiority.\nAnd even after the Nazis \u201chad discredited overt racism in international politics,\u201d this old hierarchical view hasn\u2019t disappeared to this day.\nAs Raghavan shows, it has merely been substituted with another one in \u201cAmerican theories of modernization\u201d which rank societies \u201cnot explicitly on race but on a scale of \u2018development.\u2019\u201d\nHowever, as an interesting backlash, these notions of hierarchy are continually being subverted by American intellectuals, and on a pretty familiar terrain: religion.\nNamely, after the 1970s, \n leading to a sort of a South Asian cultural and religious boom which is still going on.\nIn fact, one could even argue that nowadays it seems much more modern \n or a Buddhist (and practice yoga and meditation) than to be a Christian or a Muslim and go to church.\nA Brief History of US Involvement in South Asia\nThe first American ship sailed to South Asia in 1784; back then, the flag on the vessel was still unrecognized by most of the world and the Indians who saw it first were no exception.\nAs we said above, the reason why the American arrived in South Asia was simple: profits. They knew everything about it through the British East India Company which ruled the subcontinent and exported large quantities of Indian produce (especially textiles and spices) to the American colonies.\nHowever, the British East India Company was just too big to be meddled with (or fail), and for the next century and some, America wasn\u2019t that interested in South Asia.\nHowever, the interest was rekindled by the end of the 19\n century, courtesy of none other than Rudyard Kipling and his very popular \u2013 and very racist \u2013 poem \u201cWhite Man\u2019s Burden.\u201d\nTheodore Roosevelt liked the poem so much that he grew liking the British Raj as well and called for American colonization of the Philippines.\nIn addition, Swami Vivekananda\u2019s \u201cSisters and brothers of America\u201d speech introducing Hinduism at the Parliament of the World\u2019s Religions of Chicago in 1893 received a standing ovation from thousands of US citizens.\nThere was an even bigger fascination for Mahatma Gandhi back in the US, but the partition of Pakistan from India in 1947 led to Harry Truman\u2019s arms embargo on both countries.\nDuring the time of Nehru and the Non-Aligned Movement, the USA realized that \u201crisks to US security from a weak and vulnerable India would be greater than the risks of a stable and influential India.\u201d\nSo, it provided financial and political aid until the \u201cdangerous decade\u201d between 1970 and 1980 when the world was on the brink of a nuclear war because of the inherent problems in the political landscape of modern South Asia.\nAt the end of the decade, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan opened new problems for the US, and for a while, it looked as if the world\u2019s Western superpower had lost its primacy over South Asia to the Soviet Union.\nThe United States got closer to Pakistan because of Afghanistan, but this threatened its relations to India.\n \u201cIn the decade following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,\u201d writes Raghavan of the effects of this, \u201cthe US\u2019 relationship with India underwent a paradoxical change. On the one hand, the tremendous expansion in American aid to Pakistan for services rendered in Afghanistan met with deep disapproval from India\u2026 On the other hand, there was a change in the bilateral relations owing primarily to India\u2019s aspirations to economic transformation at home.\u201d\nDuring the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the US-funded Islamic extremist organizations such as Al-Qaeda and Taliban in the hope that this would weaken the Soviet influence.\nAnd they did.\nHowever, it was these very two once-allies which became USA\u2019s greatest enemies after the end of the Cold War, a quite conflict which culminated in the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the American invasion of Afghanistan.\nIn recent years, the US interest in India and Pakistan has been mainly governed by the fears of a nuclear war between the two countries and the rise of China on the East.\nAs a consequence of the latter, the current Indian government led by Narendra Modi is the first one to explicitly \u201ctilt heavily\u201d toward America, in an attempt to mend the \u201cpower gap\u201d opened between India and China \u2013 something which the USA has wholeheartedly embraced.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Most Dangerous Place\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0USA\u2019s Interest in South Asia Has Three Dimensions\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The USA Preferred the Muslims Over the Hindus for Centuries\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fierce Enigmas: Americans Never Understood South Asian Nations\nUSA\u2019s Interest in South Asia Has Three Dimensions\nAccording to Srinath Raghavan, USA\u2019s interests and involvements in South Asian history can be understood through three lenses: power and profit, ideology and culture.\nHistorically, it all began with an attempt to profit from the vast market of the Indian subcontinent: the first Americans to arrive there had been merchants.\nAfter several attempts to change the \u201cprimitive\u201d cultural landscape of the regions, America\u2019s foremost interest was ideological: the USA wanted to win the Cold War and India, for example, was a Non-Aligned country.\nThe USA Preferred the Muslims Over the Hindus for Centuries\nEven though it\u2019s hard to believe this in retrospect, after their first arrival on the Indian subcontinent, the Americans were so appalled by the primitive rituals of Hinduism that they thought they\u2019d have a much better understanding with the Muslims.\nAnd this went on for a while until the military backing of Al-Qaeda and Taliban (as an indirect way to weaken the Soviet Union) backfired and resulted in the 9/11 attacks.\nInterestingly, now Hinduism, Buddhism and other religions and practices of the subcontinent are all the rage this side of the Pacific.\nFierce Enigmas: Americans Never Understood South Asian Nations\nSrinath Raghavan\u2019s main point of the book is that the USA has never completely bothered to understand South Asia, resulting in a series of costly mistakes.\nIn fact, the American edition of \nis much more aptly titled \n, two words taken from Walt Whitman\u2019s poem \u201cPassage\u201d which serves as a more than worthy epigraph to the book \u2013 and a conclusion of our summary:\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Most Dangerous Place Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nhas been hailed by many as \u201cthe definitive history of US involvement in South Asia.\u201d\nWe promise you that, once you finish this book, that\u2019s exactly how you\u2019ll feel about it."},

Before, people would only consider finding a new job if they were laid off or really wanted a change. Nowadays young people are always connected, always learning about new opportunities, always keeping an eye out for something better.\nThe amount of time you spend at any job is shrinking. That\u2019s why you always need to be aware of other options, and sometimes take risks, even when it seems your current job has it all.\nCompanies don\u2019t work like they used to; they merge, transform, and replace people much faster than before.\nAnd they have access to cheap labor from all over the world. \n that you\u2019ll stay with the same company until you retire.\nSo what should you do in order to build a strong career in this fast-changing and volatile environment?\nThe answer is both simple and complex: you need to think like an entrepreneur and consider your career as your start-up. This means having a different approach from the other job candidates out there.\nBuilding niche skills, adding tons of passion to everything you do, and staying connected are only a few ingredients in the recipe.\nBut we all need to realize that the rules of the game have changed and that, for every great interview you\u2019ll have, 50 others will show up with maybe better skills and lower salary expectations. The traditional way of building your career is no longer a safe option.\nInstead, young people, these days build networks. They nurture relationships with people that are valuable to them professionally because they know that, at some point, they\u2019ll need to seek opportunities in that direction. Also, people nowadays don\u2019t limit themselves to one 9-to-5 job.\nThey like to find a field or connecting fields that they are passionate about, and explore different types of activities in that area.\nThis is very good for designing your individual path and building an identity that\u2019s different from the company you work for. If you work in marketing and are really interested in the field, you could also write a blog, create your own podcast, do public speaking gigs, or become a certified trainer in that subject.\nThis way you will not only always have a wide range of career options at your disposal, but people will also get to know you \n you created for yourself. It\u2019s like a safety net that you build:\nIn order to stay relevant, you need to always evaluate and develop your skills, and be ready to adapt. Having a 5 or 3-year long-term plan is no longer a viable solution. You may need to shift your focus and re-think your career faster than you think.\nTechnology is transforming our world faster than ever, and in a few years, some jobs may become obsolete. This is why you need a strong network of people from different fields who can keep you up-to-date with the progress and show you what opportunities are out there.\nThe interesting thing about opportunities is that they never come at a perfectly-timed moment. You seldom find out about a great new job when you\u2019re desperately searching for one. It usually happens when you\u2019re feeling pretty cozy at your current job.\nSo what do you do? Do you take a risk? Or do you keep your current position, because it\u2019s a safer option?\nRisks are becoming an integrated part of our lives. In order to succeed at the start-up of you, there are a lot of risks to be taken.\nIn order to stay ahead of the game, you need to take chances that others perceive as risks. How will you manage to differentiate them?\nOne simple answer is to invest in yourself: take classes; go to seminars; \n, decision-making under pressure, and risk management.\nAlso, surround yourself with the people that you\u2019d like to become like. Find inspiration in others that have the career you dream about, take them to lunch and pick their brains about what opportunities are out there.\nWe are social beings, and the people we know and have good relationships with can help us. It\u2019s not a company that hires you, it\u2019s a person. You can make yourself the most qualified candidate for the job.\nIf you lack people skills, your chances diminish a lot. It\u2019s no longer just about diplomas and qualifications. You need interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence, and other soft skills in order to build a strong career.\nYou can develop the start-up of you by applying \n. Make every decision in life based on these skills and you\u2019ll develop an entrepreneurial mindset that will help you in the long run.\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free\u00a0\n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Start-Up of You Quotes\u201d\nAnd one of the most important things you need to remember is that you should always be focused. Be aware of the changes that are happening around you and seize the great opportunities that come your way."},

Well, here\u2019s your chance to learn the basics:\nThe summary of Michelle\u2019s memoir \nWho Should Read \u201cBecoming\u201d? And Why?\nIf you want to learn more about Michelle Obama \u2013 and delve into Barack\u2019s story from a different perspective \u2013 then \nis the book for you.\nSince it is \u201can intimate, powerful, and inspiring memoir,\u201d it\u2019s also a great read for everyone who wants a little motivation; especially if she is a working mom who wants to make a little difference in the world.\nAbout Michelle Obama\n is an American lawyer and writer, USA\u2019s First Lady from 2009 to 2017.\nBorn and raised on the South Side of Chicago, Michelle graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School, after which she found a job at Sidney & Austin, where she met future President Barack Obama.\nAn educated advocate and campaigner against obesity and poverty, Michelle Obama was considered by many a role model for women and a fashion icon.\nIn addition\nto\n, she has also authored \n.\n\u201cBecoming PDF Summary\u201d\nAs everybody knows, \nis the deeply personal memoir of former US First Lady and downright Rockstar Michelle Obama. \nIt tells the entirety of her story through 24 chapters (plus a preface and an epilogue), divided into three suggestively titled sections:\n\u2022 \n: which covers her childhood and her education up to the time she met Barack;\n\u2022 \n which tells the story of Michelle and Barack up to the moment Michelle\u2019s husband was elected President of the United States; and\n\u2022 \n: which describes Michelle\u2019s and Barack\u2019s life at the White House.\nNow that you know the outline, it\u2019s time to get into some more detail!\nBecoming Me\nMichelle LaVaughn Robinson was born on January 17, 1964, and lived in a house just 9 miles away from the place where four years later a violent clash would break out between the police and Vietnam War protesters.\nWhat was Michelle doing at the time?\nWhy, of course: she was playing with her dolls; to this day, as she makes it more than clear in the \u201cEpilogue\u201d of \n, she has remained put off by the \u201cnastiness\u201d of politics, \u201cthe tribal segregation of red and blue, this idea that we\u2019re supposed to choose one side and stick to it, unable to listen and compromise, or sometimes even to be civil.\u201d\nAnyway, Michelle Robinson had a wonderful childhood.\nShe was the daughter of a creative jazz-loving father, Fraser Robinson III, a Democratic precinct captain, and a generous mother, Marian Shields Robinson, who was a full-time housewife until Michelle entered high school and a secretary at Spiegel\u2019s catalog store afterward.\nThe Robinsons \u2013 Michelle also has a brother, Craig, two years older than her \u2013 lived on the second floor of a two-story house; Michelle\u2019s great aunt, Robbie, and uncle lived on the first floor.\nRobbie was a piano teacher, and at about the time of the unrests which marked the 1968 Democratic National Convention, Michelle started her piano lessons.\nBack in 1950, fifteen years before her parents had moved there, Chicago\u2019s South Side had been 96 percent white. \nBy the time Michell would leave the place for college in 1981, it would be about 96 percent black.\nSo, in a way, Michelle was born right in the middle of that transition. A great thing, since that meant the neighborhood was racially mixed, with little Michelle\u2019s friends being \u201ca motley mix of last names \u2013 Kansopant, Abuasef, Yacker, Robinson.\u201d\nThey may tell you that \n, but to those living there it was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 a home.\nBe that as it may, Michelle was a precocious child and when in second grade she revealed to her parents that her classes are boring and that she hates them.\nHer mother \u2013 her smart mother, might we add \u2013 got her tested and Michelle moved up one grade, a decision which (Michelle still thinks) greatly influenced her life.\nEventually, she ended up in the progressive Whitney M. Young High School: it took her two busses and about an hour and a half to get there; but, eventually, it was worth it.\nMichelle excelled at her high school and was on track to be in the top 10 percent of her class, but still, when the time came, her college counselor told her that she is not sure Michelle is a Princeton material.\nAnd Princeton, ever since Michelle\u2019s brother Craig got into it (by the way, \n) \u2013 and ever since she had the opportunity to get to know the place \u2013 was Michelle\u2019s top (if not \n) choice.\nFortunately, Michelle was from early on aware that \u201cfailure is a feeling long before it\u2019s an actual result;\u201d so, instead of allowing this judgment to topple her confidence, she used it as a motivation to get into Princeton.\nAnd, eventually, she did.\nThere, for the first time in her life, she realized the meaning of the word division: less than a tenth of the students at Princeton were black.\nFortunately, Princeton had an organization known as the Third World Center (TWC), which was formed to support students of color.\nAnd even more fortunately, at its head was \n, \u201ca smart and beautiful black woman, barely thirty years old, a swift-moving and lively New Yorker who wore flared jeans and wedge sandals and seemed always to be having four or five ideas at once.\u201d\nFor all students of color at Princeton, Brasuell was \u201can \u00fcber-mentor,\u201d an \u201cultrahip and always outspoken defender in chief,\u201d and Michelle became not only her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 but also her assistant.\nMichelle learned a lot from her, including how to be a mom long before she became one: Brasuell was a single mother of a precocious boy named Jonathan, whom Michelle often babysat.\nAfter taking her LSAT test, Michelle went straight from Princeton to Harvard Law School, after which she moved back to Chicago to start working for the respected firm of Sidney & Austin.\nAnd there, she met a certain Barack Obama.\nNow, this Barack guy came to Sidney & Austin for the same reason many promising law students did: to be advised on his next steps.\nUnlike them, however, he was so exceptional \u2013 since he had taken a few years off before Harvard Law School, Barack was also a little older \u2013 that instead him being the advised one, he started advising Michelle\u2019s colleagues soon after walking in the offices of Sidney & Austin.\nMichelle was fortunate enough to be assigned for three months as Obama\u2019s adviser, but she wasn\u2019t that taken with him; for one, he was a smoker, and Michelle hated smokers.\nHowever, after some time, Barack did manage to get through to Michelle and after the first kiss, \u201ceverything felt clear.\u201d\nBecoming Us\nNow, Barack had to pass one more test before proving himself worthy of becoming Michelle\u2019s husband: the test of her brother Craig.\nAnd it was a strange test indeed:\nAfter Barack finished his studies at Harvard Law School, he joined Michelle in Chicago, and in October 1992, the two married.\nHowever, both of them were so much busy with so many side projects and ideas that, in the end, they didn\u2019t have such a great honeymoon.\nNamely, it had to be cut short, because Barack was enlisted to help the Project VOTE! Initiative. Michelle had a couple of projects of her own at the time, mostly through the help and influence of Valerie Jarett, then an unsatisfied lawyer who felt a calling to help people and, to do so, left her high-paying job.\nYup, we\u2019re talking about Barack\u2019s \n: he met her through Michelle.\nAll in all, being Obama had its ebbs and flows, more of the former at the beginning. \u201cTired and stressed,\u201d wrote Barack about this time in \n, \u201cwe had little time for conversation, much less romance.\u201d\nAfter Barack\u2019s success during the Project VOTE! campaign, an article in a Chicago magazine suggested that he should run for office.\nBarack shrugged off the idea because he had a plan of his own: to tell his unusual life story in a book titled \n.\nThe book was published in 1995 to positive reviews and little sales; this time, when Barack was approached about entering politics, he didn\u2019t refuse.\nMichelle was skeptical: she believed that Barack could do much more good as the head of a non-profit organization; Barack dreamt bigger.\nBut the bigger the dreams, the bigger the burden.\nAnd this became especially problematical after the birth of the couple\u2019s children, Malia Ann Obama (born on the Fourth of July, 1998) and Natasha \u201cSasha\u201d Marian Obama (born on June 10, three years later).\nHowever, when you\u2019re a politician and you have a family, you can be sure that, sooner or later, some of your opponents\u2019 low blows will come into their direction as well; even when they\u2019re not explicitly mentioned.\nFor example, a year after Malia was born, she got an ear infection in Hawaii, just at the time the Illinois Senate announced an emergency vote on a rather important gun control bill.\nBarack chose to remain with the family (Malia wasn\u2019t allowed to fly in her condition) and that earned him a few rather unpleasant descriptions, ranging from \u201ceducated fool\u201d to \u201cgutless sheep\u201d to \u201ca white man in blackface\u2026 using his child as an excuse not to go to work.\u201d\nBarack wasn\u2019t hurt by these comments since he had expected them; Michelle, however, was deeply affected.\nIn time, Barack started skipping family dinners; Michelle wasn\u2019t too pleased about this and she was even less pleased when Barack told her that he has an intention to run first for Senator and then for President.\nThe reason why Michelle allowed him to do this?\nBecause she was pretty sure that he would lose the Senate race, and she made him swear that if he did, he\u2019d give up politics altogether and start dedicating more and more time to his family.\nAnd then, Barack\u2019s keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention came \u2013 it would be an understatement to say it was a success \u2013 and his Republican opponent for the Illinois Senator seat, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race due to a sex scandal.\nTo Michelle\u2019s disbelief, people had started talking about Barack becoming the First Black President.\nAnd as you know full well, a few years later, he did.\nBecoming More\nNow, being the First Lady doesn\u2019t mean that you stop being a mother; and being a mother at the White House is a completely different matter from being a mother anywhere else.\nAnd possibly that\u2019s why, soon after moving to the White House, Michelle received a call from none other than Barack\u2019s opponent in \u201cthe brutal 2008 primary,\u201d Hillary Clinton.\nAfter all, she had some ideas about it means to be a mother while also being the First Lady.\nAnd, to tell you the truth, reading Michelle\u2019s biography reveals that this is a lot more complicated thing than you can imagine; for one thing, friends of Malia and Sasha couldn\u2019t just pop up to visit and play; neither could they run out to the garden without having their Social Security numbers checked by the authorities.\nMichelle\u2019s job?\nTo find a way to tell her children that the White House was their home and that they should treat it as such. Meaning: playing in the hallways is \n allowed.\nAs soon as she became the First Lady, Michelle Obama was determined to use her position to make some good in the world.\nThe first thing she did, however, was a bit \n: she cultivated her garden, aka she decided to start one to make the White House feel more like a home.\nNext, she started the Let\u2019s Move! Imitative, which aimed to solve \u201cthe challenge of childhood obesity within a generation so that children born today will reach adulthood at a healthy weight.\u201d\nIts ambitious plan \u2013 to reduce childhood obesity to 5% by 2030 \u2013 was carried through in four different ways:\n\u2022 informing parents about everything related to healthier dietary options;\n\u2022 making the food at schools healthier;\n\u2022 distributing healthy food to many rural and urban areas lacking fresh fruit and vegetables; and\n\u2022 getting kids to be more physically active.\nThe results?\n45 million kids are now eating healthier food, and 11 million are physically way more active than about a decade ago.\nThis success inspired Michelle to start the Joining Forces initiative (which helped more than 1 million veterans and their spouses get a job) and, then, the Let Girls Learn initiative which is still empowering girls by granting them their right to education worldwide.\nBarack and Michelle Obama \n and, looking back, Michelle is happy with what they accomplished.\nHowever, she\u2019s not that happy with the man who came to the office after them. Politics aside \u2013 says Michelle \u2013 this is a man who was heard by the entire USA to have habitually bullied women and got away with it.\nThis is what Michelle tried to make known to the world when speaking in favor of her husband\u2019s one-time opponent and afterward, \n, before the election.\nHere\u2019s her take on the matters:\nAnd that\u2019s how we hold our heads \u2013 even when we lose.\nBecoming Epilogue\nIn the \u201cEpilogue\u201d Michelle Obama reveals, yet again, that she isn\u2019t that fond of politics; however, she makes it clear that she cares deeply about the future of her country, especially nowadays with an almost openly racist President.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been distressing to see,\u201d she writes, \u201chow the behavior and the political agenda of the current president have caused many Americans to doubt themselves and to doubt and fear one another. It\u2019s been hard to watch as carefully built, compassionate policies have been rolled back, as we\u2019ve alienated some of our closest allies and left vulnerable members of our society exposed and dehumanized. I sometimes wonder where the bottom might be.\u201d\nAnd she concludes with a plea for interhuman awareness:\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cBecoming Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nMichelle Obama\u2019s \nis everything you\u2019d expect from a book written by the first African-American First Lady in the history of the United States.\nAnd it wasn\u2019t an Oprah Book Club 2.0 2018 selection for no reason, right there with Tayari Jones\u2019 \nand Anthony Ray Hinton\u2019s \nCandid, nicely written, engaging, personal \u2013 you\u2019ll love almost everything about \n.

In \n, the emphasis is mostly on Welch\u2019s\u00a0career and less of his private life.\nSo, let\u2019s take a look \n\u2019s professional life story.\nGeneral Electric is one of the biggest companies in the world. The fact that over the last 30 years it developed and bought a lot of other small companies and ended up in businesses from aircraft engines and power generators to plastics, medical, and financial services, is due in great part to Jack Welch and his vision.\n\u201cJack: Straight from the Gut PDF Summary\u201d\nHe realized that he could do anything and transform every business into a success, as long as he had by his side the right people.\n. But after working a few years with General Electrics, he realized that he really enjoyed his work and he wanted to climb the ladder as high as possible.\nEven though he was not one of the top favorites for the position, the fact that he had a vision and he had good instincts helped him get the job. He was not always right about his decisions. Some deals were not profitable at all.\nYou may say it was like a game of trial and error until he \n. That he could see a good deal from the beginning of the negotiations.\nJack Welch understood that \n for the thousands of people that work for you. Having such a large company, it was difficult to create a culture that helped everyone feel like a part of the team and feel connected.\nThis is why Jack invested a lot in training, creating facilities for conferences and meetings. Even if he had to let go some of the employees, \n in things that in the long-term made all the difference. Jack understood from the beginning that it\u2019s all about the people:\nSo \nHe wanted to work only with the best and make them feel appreciated and welcomed in GE.\nIn order to do this, he had to be very drastic about the differentiation system\nHe implemented an \n \n had to apply in every company that was part of General Electrics.\nBased on the evaluation, all the people that scored in the bottom 10% had to be removed from the company.\nIt was hard, especially because at first the managers refused to cooperate and were offering misleading results. But in the end, everyone understood that on a long-term, this is the only way that General Electrics could stay on top.\nAnother thing that Welch did not like in General Electrics and that he struggled a lot to change, was \n:\nHis vision was not always supported by his colleagues.

And Why?\nEvidently, \u201c\n\u201d is intended for the female audience, because it empowers women to take hold of their life.\nIn the process, Rachel blames no other than the \u201cI\u201d itself, which is filled with concepts that hinder this growth.\nStop apologizing, and accept the shame-free plan! \nAbout Rachel Hollis\n made headlines with \n which remained on the best-selling position for almost an entire year.\nApart from being a writer, she is also a TV personality, motivational speaker, and a mother of four.\n\u201cGirl, Stop Apologizing PDF Summary\u201d\nWhat if you are not compelled to please anyone about anything?\nDoes that seem too harsh?\nIt\u2019s okay to admit that \u2013 we all probably pretend to be endorsing the claim that opinions of others don\u2019t matter to us, but more often than not we find ourselves hurt by them.\nEven Rachel doesn\u2019t always succeed in discarding the impulses coming from the other side of the fence. \nSo, the key thing is not to have this sense of guilt for whatever you want to accomplish!\nNonetheless, whatever dream you have, sooner or later is going to be questioned.\nYour only responsibility is to make sure that the environment and people around you, will not shatter it.\nRachel points out that a large percentage of women lack self-appreciation and the wits needed to hold onto their vision of themselves. \nThey occasionally talk themselves out of their own dreams, while clinging to some shallow excuse.\nExcuse #1 \u2013 That\u2019s Not What Other Women Do\nAny dream starts with a simple question and soon enters into the planning stage, where it often fades away.\nThere are a lot of \u201cWhat Ifs,\u201d which if properly understood could signify the beginning of a new era.\nLet\u2019s take a hypothetical overview on this matter.\nCan you imagine what could happen if only 5% of all women, embraced the \u201c\n\u201d mentality? This outlook on life is composed of self-respect, dignity, and willingness to push the boundaries.\nDo you have any idea on how cheerful, and self-fulfilled these women would be? \nAnd yet, we are taught that women should feel guilty about something they want to achieve. Don\u2019t blame society just yet, because Rachel identifies a culprit from within, and that\u2019s what you should do as well.\nBy the same token, there are some people who love to procrastinate and others who can be labeled as overachievers.\nIn which category do you fall into?\nUnfortunately, as we said, many women still suffer from other people\u2019s opinions. It\u2019s so ingrained in them that even resisting this notion seems like a tougher nut to crack than merely accepting it and move on.\nLet\u2019s cut to the chase!\nFirst off, you need to understand that being at the helm, doesn\u2019t come absent sacrifice. \nRachel asserts that embracing personal responsibility as a child leads to better execution as an adult.\nIt goes without saying that identification with something starts when we are toddlers.\nIn other words, we are taught that pretending to be somebody other than yourself is how things unfold.\nLiving a double life was no exception to Rachel.\nSo many things were wrapped into this lifestyle, that seemed as if pursuing her goals was like a fantasy that\u2019s not worthy of her energy.\nAs a consequence of that, she decided to bury her dreams deep inside her, never to allow them to flourish at the very least.\nIt took Rachel almost four years to initiate significant changes regarding her dreams.\nAt one point, she started \n and began seriously ruminating on other possibilities.\nBlogging was trendy, and she decided to give it a go.\nWhen she started blogging, Rachel already had an event-planning firm in downtown LA, and a pretty successful one to say the least.\nRachel admits that at the outset of this transition, she didn\u2019t know what the heck to do. So, Rachel wrote casual posts about her daily life and took random pictures.\nWith time, business began to emerge out of the shadows.\nBut one day, all hell broke loose.\nPeople who were following her discovered that she wasn\u2019t, in fact, a stay-at-home mom (in the traditional sense).\nShe had help with regards to content production and editing, and her husband also helped her out a lot.\nIn the meantime, a group of angry followers attacked her for having a nanny, because they felt betrayed. On the other end of the line, Rachel was shocked to see and eventually understand that people perceive others in a way that correlates with their self-image.\nSo many years have passed, and Rachel still felt this remorse for not being able to battle her way through life.\nThe transition took place when she stopped apologizing for her life-choices.\nWhile growing up, she noticed that society determines your value based on the selection of traits that describe perfect male or female behavior.\nExcuse #2 \u2013 I am Not a Goal-Oriented Person\nYou better read that twice, so that you digest it a bit better.\nIf you think about it, a dream is nothing but a goal, that still hasn\u2019t reached the implementation phase. \nUnlike dreams, goals tend to be more specific, or you might say that the ideas are coming your way.\nWithout action, or steps leading to the achievement of those goals; encouragement and positivity are utterly worthless. \nIt may sound like a clich\u00e9, but if you have low self-esteem and if you don\u2019t trust in your ability to make changes, then you really won\u2019t be able to handle the heat.\nExcuse #3 \u2013 I Don\u2019t Have Time\nThis false argument is something that most people can relate to.\nWell, here\u2019s the cure to this issue.\nYou don\u2019t need to find time to \n; you\u2019d have to take the time yourself that will bring those goals within reach.\nExcuse #4 \u2013 I am Not Enough to Succeed\nEven the smartest people at some point in their lives had this feeling of worthlessness.\nRachel calls out the voice in our heads that can also be labeled as the blabbermouth who finds joy in pointing out all the flaws that manifest your triviality.\nFight it, and don\u2019t allow it to make you feel like crap. \nExcuse #5 \u2013 I Can\u2019t Pursue My Dream and Still Be a Good Mom/Daughter/Employee\nThis is a very common fear.\nIt\u2019s like we feel guilty for putting our own interests above everyone else\u2019s. \nEven though the people have different priorities and one can\u2019t argue otherwise, it\u2019s of exponential value to put your happiness upfront.\nThen, you\u2019ll be of better service to the people around you!\nExcuse #6 \u2013 I am Terrified of Failure\nWell, who isn\u2019t?\nBut is that a legitimate reason for \n and not giving it a shot regardless of how stupid it seems?\nAbsolutely not!\nTell everybody about your endeavors, and the pressure itself will make you perform better. Don\u2019t shy away from having that extra burden on your shoulders, and keep your dreams afloat.\nExcuse #7 \u2013 It\u2019s Been Done Before\nSome smarter person has already built that app, started that non-profit, created a similar company, wrote a similar book \u2013 I can go on.\nJust imagine the idiocy here \u2013 you are literally blocking yourself out of your true self, without even attempting to question your position.\nExcuse #8 \u2013 What Will They Think\nIn all honesty, their opinion is their business, not yours.\nWith that said, why we get hurt all the time by shallow and often mean comments?\nYou want to know the dirty secret? \nIt\u2019s not the fear of failure that keeps you down, but what others will think of you once you fail! \nExcuse #9 \u2013 Good Girls Don\u2019t Hustle\nYou know better than anybody else what you are!\nRachel doesn\u2019t disparage women with a more traditional sense who prefer the quiet life.\nOn the contrary, she values choice, and the choice you make is going to be your ticket way out.\n, Rachel tells us which behaviors we ought to adopt.\nBehavior #1 \u2013 Stop Asking Permission\nDo we need to say more?\nYour behavior is basically the reflection of your inner-perception of yourself.\n to do anything within the confines of morally-acceptable action.\nIt\u2019s not rocket science to learn how to prioritize your tasks, and take pleasure in everything.\nBehavior #2 \u2013 Choose One Dream and Go All In\nBeing a scatterbrain won\u2019t do you any good!\nAccording to Rachel, you can only focus on a single goal and making it work.\nIf there is no plan B, you\u2019d be much more motivated to achieve your dreams, and climb up the ladder.\nBehavior #3 \u2013 Embrace Your Ambition\nThese days, we bear witness to people who are scolded for being too ambitious. Women, generally speaking, receive criticism for having that burning desire to prosper in the material sense.\nHowever, there are serious issues with failing to spot the signs of workaholism.\nTaking the middle route is probably your best bet.\nBehavior #4 \u2013 Ask for Help!\nSorry, but it\u2019s impossible to do everything yourself, and there\u2019s no shame in asking for an extra hand.\nGetting to the next level requires training, experience, and time.\nRachel realized that there aren\u2019t self-made successes, because one way or the other, you must rely on somebody!\nBehavior #5 \u2013 Build Foundations for Success\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you have the knowledge and the passion for achieving your dreams; if the daily timetable is there to sabotage your next move.\nLet\u2019s cover up a few things that could help you in the execution of this step:\nBehavior #6 \u2013 Stop Allowing Them To Talk You Out of It\nA thing that happens, a lot!\nMore often than not, the people discouraging you from moving on, are those from your closest circle.\nAllowing someone to take control of what you do, truly is a recipe for imminent catastrophe.\nYou\u2019ve got to break the habit of listening to what other people think about your plans.\nBehavior #7 \u2013 Learn To Say No\nRachel has been taught or better yet, programmed to \u201clove\u201d certain things that she actually hated doing.\nNowadays, she prefers the brutally honest perspective that gives her enough freedom to make up her own mind and set up her schedule.\nIf you don\u2019t like something \u2013 just say NO.\nAnd to achieve all of this, you would need the following skillset:\nKey Lessons from \u201cGirl, Stop Apologizing\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Girls, You Can Make It \n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keep the Chin Up\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Embrace the Pressure\nGirls, You Can Make it\nAfter everything we said, this is an obvious conclusion.\nEven if you feel like an underdog, no force in the world can stop a person who has no plan B in their pocket.\nJust go for it!\nKeep the Chin Up\nPeople around you might not accept this transition.\nIt\u2019s tough to keep your composure when nothing goes in your favor, but then again, you must find that resilience and perseverance to go through it.\nRemember, don\u2019t be a pushover.\nEmbrace the Pressure\nA lot of times, you\u2019d feel like giving up, but remember that Rachel failed more times than she could remember.\nThe magic lies in attempting, over and over again.\nDon\u2019t run away when things go South, because the sun always comes up after a storm.\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free \n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cGirl, Stop Apologizing Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nLast but not least, Rachel advises you to embrace uncertainty and enter into beast mode!\nGet into the right frame of mind, and tackle the elements which may impede your ascension.\nOn top of that, don\u2019t forget to visualize the best version of yourself to make quicker progress."},

Mark\u00a0has a strategic mind and a\u00a0realistic point of view.\nHe makes a list of\u00a0changes\u00a0that\u00a0have occurred\u00a0once this\u00a0online era was born.\nThis turned us into more \n \nduring the buying process.\nIn this perpetually changing world, it\u2019s getting harder and harder for sellers to accomplish their goals. In order to succeed, sale zones need intelligent people to do this job.\nExperience so far has changed the vendor\u2019s perception. Customers are more suspicious when they are approached directly by vendors.\nThey prefer to be the ones who take the first step towards the seller.\nThrough the eyes of the author, this book is meant to teach, prove and predict plenty of interesting things about the sales field.\nBut above all these, Mark Roberge is designing a brand-new image for the salespersons.\nHe\u2019s doing his duty to change, \n and bring more awareness of the salesperson qualities in the eyes of customers.\nRoberge was the number 4 employee at Hubspot, and his main challenge was to scale the sales force during the first 7 years of the company. The team went from 1 employee in sales (himself) to more than 450 people among areas like sales, services, and support.\nMost interesting of all is that, when Roberge started, he had no sales experience and that, to a certain extent, was an advantage.\nRoberge is a software engineer by training who later migrated to the business area getting an MBA at MIT which allowed him to see sales through a point of view focused on technology and data analysis.\nThat was the mission that Roberge set for himself. To do this, he created 4 tactics that could help him achieve this goal:\nThese are some of the key points that allowed Mark\u2019s acceleration strategies to succeed. Let\u2019s take a closer look at them.\nTo build a scalable and predictable sales team, the first step is to hire the right people.\nFor Mark, there is no single vendor background that works for every business. Each company is unique and relies on its own context.\nRoberge tried and managed to hire more experienced sellers from other well-known companies, but they did not stand out as much as he hoped.\nSelling a product from a known company is simpler than the product of a \n.\nThe Hubspot sale was evangelistic, consultative, and unlike the other sales companies that had big teams. So Mark had to learn, in a way, in his own way.\nAlthough each company has its unique candidate \n and its own hiring process, it has chosen to create a standard method, such as an engineer,\n.\nHe started by listing 10 attributes he sought from the candidates and believed to be the ones that would correlate most with success in sales.\nBased on this, each candidate interviewed, and each candidate that was joining the company received a grade for each of these 10 criteria.\nAfter 6 months using this process, he hired half a dozen people.\nSome stood out, others not so much.\nTo understand this, he came back to analyze the performance of the best and try to understand what was consistent with his ideas of success attributes and what attributes were missing by reviewing his list of criteria.\nTwo years later, he already had dozens of vendors and enough data to do a regression analysis to understand, from the attributes he imagined correlated to success and which actually had the most significant impact on each candidate. Mark was surprised analyzing the results.\nHis list had attributes constantly associated with sales professionals, such as \u201cability to close deals,\u201d \u201cObjection Management,\u201d and \u201c\n,\u201d and incredible as it may seem, they did not correlate successfully with sales at Hubspot. In fact, in some cases, these attributes hurt the candidates.\nThe attributes that had a correlation with success were characteristics such as \u201cPreparation\u201d, \u201cKnowledge in the area\u201d, \u201cIntelligence\u201d, that is, characteristics of people with traits of consultants, counselors.\nAnd that made Roberge understand that there was a difference in the buyer\u2019s expectation as to precisely what a seller was.\nThe new buyer has much more control over the buying process, and so they seek out someone who understands it and manages real value for their decision making.\nIn Mark\u2019s case (and he points out that this may not work for other companies), the criteria for predicting a candidate\u2019s success were, in order:\nAnd from that analysis, Mark ensured he knew exactly who he would like to hire for his commercial team and succeed at all times.\nOnce we have the right candidate, the next step is to ensure that the training is the same for all of them.\nThe market standard for training new salespeople at the time was simple.\nCommercial directors hired new candidates and asked them to \u201cstick\u201d to the best-performing salespeople to learn by watching the other vendors sell.\nFor Mark, this did not seem scalable, and he noticed it early.\nAlthough the sellers had the same set of characteristics, they were different. Some focused on \n. Others were terrific in rapport and connecting emotionally with their customers.\nThese different skills were not easy to pass from seller to seller because each seller succeeds in his unique way.\nTherefore, he chose to create a standard training that went through the client\u2019s buying journey, the sales process and a qualification matrix.\nMark and his team spent a month building their own methodology and ensuring that their vendors understood how the new buyer has more control over the new buying process.\nThe seller\u2019s role is to help you in an advisory fashion to reach the end.\nFrom there, he decided that at Hubspot, every salesperson should go through 30 days of training.\nIn this training, he needed to use the company\u2019s software, know its functionality, and understand precisely what the company\u2019s customers were doing with their product.\nWhen these salespeople got on the phone to talk to their customers, they were actually able to explain how the product could help them, after all, they had actually put themselves in their place.\nAnother important point was that the sellers would participate in the digital communities where the buyers met. Blogs, social networks, LinkedIn groups, Twitter profiles, etc.\nWith hired and trained salespeople, it\u2019s time for action and for that they need leads.\nAnd the challenge is to ensure that salespeople have a predictable flow of leads coming in so they can work.\nThe digital consumer is already online researching solutions to solve their problems on the internet.\nTherefore, it is crucial that the company does marketing on this channel and offers solutions for customers who are seeking to solve these issues and this is something that depends on the production of content.\nIdeally, hire a journalist or someone with experience in the field. The person does not necessarily need to know everything about their company or area of expertise.\nShe needs to be able to talk to her team, her executives, and turn that knowledge into content for the end consumer.\nThe idea is that he interviews these people and, from that, he creates a free ebook, 1 \n, 4 blog posts and posts on social networks.\nThe content of the blog and social networks lead people to download the free ebook, and in this process, the company can collect information from people who really have the problem you are looking for.\n\\Leads! Another important point is to align the marketing and sales teams.\nTo avoid the sales team from complaining about the quality of leads, volume, and abstract criteria, a more considerable alignment is required.\nRoberge created with the marketing team an SLA (service level agreement) so that there was no abstraction when evaluating performance between teams.\nWith this, each lead generated by the marketing becomes a monetary value based on the conversion rate of that lead.\nWith SLA marketing, marketing and sales learn that, for example, if they give 100 leads that downloaded an ebook to a sales professional, he can connect with 30 of them, make 15 statements and close 5 contracts of $1000, making it clear that every lead that marketing is worth $50 in revenue.\nOf course, different types of leads have different conversion rates, a user who downloads an ebook is less likely to buy than one who requests a product test.\nTo understand each type of lead, Hubspot created a matrix of lead education and from it, it was clear to understand the value of each lead and what conversion rate was expected for it.\nStill, it is possible to model how much each lead is worth and what monetary value in leads marketing needs to deliver for the sales team to meet its goal.\nIn addition to marketing within an SLA, the sales team must also follow a predictable standard procedure.\nOnce the lead is received, how many contact attempts are required to be made until it closes or is discarded?\nTo do this, again Mark turned to statistical analysis and clearly defined how many tries had to be made for each type of lead.\nIn the end, he came to the conclusion that for small businesses, the ideal number was 5, for averages, 8 were needed, and 12 for large companies.\nWith that done, everything was automated in CRM and people came to follow this new model, making the valuable leads generated by the marketing were being treated with the attention deserved.\nFrom then on, this SLA between both teams is tracked daily, and the results are visible to all.\nThe primary task of the sales manager is not to keep the pipeline up to date or to make sales forecasts.\nThe most important thing is to ensure that all the vendors are adopting the process and understand how they can use it, their challenges and work with them to overcome them.\nTo promote someone to management and ensure that the person will succeed, they need to be able to train a salesperson, see how things are going and give continuous feedback so that he can overcome his challenges, one or two things at a time.\nThat is a coaching approach based entirely on metrics.\nIf you have a team of \n, a constant volume of leads, and a clear process, your biggest challenge is to help people improve at the points of difficulty in that process.\nObserved conversion rates at each stage of the funnel, you can do this.\nIf a salesperson is great in the first phase of the connection, but not so good at presentation or closing, the manager must work that particular point with him weekly until the performance is corrected.\nIf another salesperson is excellent at demonstrations and closings but has difficulty connecting with leads, it is important that he be able to develop this skill with the help of his manager.\nIt is essential to know how to ask the right questions to find the professional\u2019s difficulties.\nBesides, listening to leads together and analyzing the cadence of emails helps the person to learn and improve their rates at every stage of the business process.\nThe use of competitions in sales can help the company as a whole to sell more.\nWhich seller does not want an additional bonus on stocks or financial? As Hubspot grew, Roberge was able to use these competitions/campaigns to ensure the team upped its performance.\nHe would make small monthly competitions to solve challenges such as reinforcing desired behaviors, achieving short-term goals and enhancing team integration.\nTo make a successful sales competition, you need to:\nUse mastery competitions, and you will be able to direct your team to the desired goals.\nTraditional Role Playing used to be a common sales training tactic. On the other hand, it is challenging to use this interpretation as a training tool because it is difficult to measure its results.\nTherefore, Roberge created a Role-Playing model, which has a fixed curriculum, structured and based on real sales situations.\nTraining included testing, certifications, and helping candidates \n.\nThese evaluations were passed on to the seller\u2019s manager, who used them to ensure that they focused on opportunities for growth.\nThat allowed each team member always to know their strengths and also had a clear path to evolve.\nAt Hubspot, most of the sales innovations came from the team and not from the managers. Ideas began to emerge, and Roberge created a model to ensure that experiments would be sources of learning.\nTo have a new experiment in progress, it was necessary: To be clear to all what would be success or failure before implementing it; Find the smallest possible investment to take this test without compromising the team\u2019s performance; Select the best possible people to perform the test.\nThis environment, which is prone to experimentation, has allowed Hubspot to create its channel sales team, which currently accounts for almost 40% of the company\u2019s sales.\nIn order to have a successful team, it is necessary that the company\u2019s compensation plan is aligned with the objectives of the business.\nHowever, many companies do not evolve their compensation plans as the company grows.\nAs Hubspot evolved, the compensation plan went through several phases.\nUp to the first 1000 customers, the strategy was focused entirely on bringing new customers to the company.\nSo the compensation plan was based only on closing new customers and did not include retention bonuses.\nAs the company grew, the plan was adjusted to ensure that the company brought customers and these customers were retained, thus maximizing the value captured by the organization and focusing on the sellers in bringing the right customers.\nIn this compensation plan, the seller received commissions for being able to better retain the customers he sold, and that made him sell to customers with the most appropriate profile.\nAnother incentive was to commission more aggressively sellers who were able to receive the value of the annual advance contract and thereby improve the company\u2019s cash flow.\n\u201cSales Acceleration Formula Quotes\u201d\nFinal Notes:\n\u201cThe Sales Acceleration Formula\u201d is a fantastic book because it allows us to look at how one of the best sales teams in the world works and how they managed to scale and become a billionaire company in such a short time.\nIf you have a startup and want to set up your sales team, this reading is essential, and we recommend that you stop everything now and buy the whole book!\nMark Roberge\u2019s lessons can help revolutionize any business that relies on a commercial team."},

And Why?\nLong before positive thinking, affirmations and the Law of Attraction became parts of common knowledge, Catherine Ponder made them a thing, though using a few different words: radiation, attraction, visualization, circulation, and the Law of Creative Prosperity.\nReaders of self-help New Thought books should definitely have a look, especially if they are religious; and those who believe in \n, shouldn\u2019t think twice before buying this book.\nThere\u2019s a reason why they call Ponder \u201cthe \n among lady ministers.\u201d\nAbout Catherine Ponder\n is an American Unity Church minister and bestselling author of a few New Thought prosperity-themed books.\nBorn in 1927, Catherine Ponder received degrees in both business and education in North Carolina before being ordained as a minister in 1958. \nHer first ministry was in Birmingham, Alabama, after which she moved to Austin, Texas, and then to San Antonio. In 1973 she moved to Palm Desert, from where she heads global ministry, having founded Unity Church Worldwide, an affiliate of Unity Church.\nPublished in 1962, Ponder\u2019s first book, \n, made her a national celebrity.

You cannot serve both God and money.\u201d\nTrue, says Ponder, but there\u2019s a difference between \n money and merely earning them. \nMoney for money\u2019s sake is bad and godless; but there\u2019s nothing wrong with earning money while serving God.\nIn other words, a rich person \n enter the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 19:23-26) if he isn\u2019t attached to his money but to God; in fact, one could argue that it\u2019s a bit more difficult for a poor one:\nVisualize Your Desires\nAfter doing away with the apparently false equation \u201cmoney = sin,\u201d Ponder introduces a new one, this time a correct one, the guiding principle of her book: \u201cvisualizations of desires = success.\u201d\nShe\u2019s not the first person \u2013 religious or non-religious \u2013 to proclaim this, but she is certainly one of the numbered few who did manage to popularize the concept long before \nturned it into a piece of common knowledge.\nA decade and a half before \n, Ponder suggests that regular visualization of your biggest dreams will inevitably lead to their realization. \nAlmost unsurprisingly, she finds evidence for this in the \n and in James Allen\u2019s seminal classic on the subject, \n:\nIn other words, thinking happy thoughts results in happy events; bad thoughts and doubts lead to misfortunes.\nWrite It Down, Make It Happen\nThinking big and good is merely the first step; writing your thoughts apparently further hacks this fireproof system.\nIn other words, even though God is an all-knowing being, he too needs some help: writing down your thoughts should help him turn them into reality more efficiently.\nAnother important thing: even though they say that the devil is in the details, Ponder is adamant that you must be specific when writing down your goals.\nDon\u2019t just say that you want to be rich; say that, for example, you want to earn 10 million dollars within the next half a decade.\nAnd just like Jim Carrey \u2013 \n.\nPonder writes of a man \u2013 \u201ca successful businessman, lecturer, and writer\u201d \u2013 who \u201cdared to write out hundreds of times some simple words as to how he wished things to be, rather than fretting about how they appeared at the moment.\u201d\nAnd she advises that you do the same.\nBecause if you are \u201ccontent to idly drift in a stream of small events and small expectations,\u201d chances are you probably will.\nPonder often asks people to write down and regularly use this basic statement as a starting point \u201cto help expand and intensify their constructive desires\u201d: \u201cI desire the highest and best in life, and I now draw the highest and best to me.\u201d\nAnd then it\u2019s time to sketch out a plan.\nOr to quote Henriette Anne Klauser: \n!\nRadiation and Attraction\nNow, why should all of this work?\nBecause, Ponder says, there are some unwritten laws which guide the universe and the one which should interest you the most is the law of radiation and attraction.\nTo phrase it in the form of a beloved \nquote: \u201cin the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.\u201d \nRadiate, and you will attract; or, in more common words, give, and you shall receive.\nYup, we just quoted the Bible yet again; or \n \u2013 whichever one you prefer.\n\u201cIf I could shout one message to the whole world regarding life\u2019s secrets,\u201d writes Catherine Ponder years before Joey \u201chow you doin\u2019\u201d Tribbiani, \u201cit would be this:\u201d\nOnce again, Ponder makes known to her readers that this is neither a new idea nor one that should be dismissed by even the most skeptical of readers.\nRalph Waldo Emerson, she reminds us, \u201cmight have been describing this law of giving and receiving or radiation and attraction when he wrote \u2018Great hearts send forth steadily the secret forces that incessantly draw great events, and wherever the mind of man goes, nature will accompany him, no matter what the path.\u2019\u201d\nThe trick is to be one of those with a great heart.\nAnd if you are thinking and radiating great thoughts and expectancies of success and prosperity instead of failure, trouble, and limitation \u2013 then you \n.\nTithing and Circulation\nWe know what you\u2019re thinking: the only thing more old-fashioned than the word \u201ctithing\u201d\nis probably the practice of tithing.\nIn case you don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about, tithing is the practice of giving away the first tenth of your income to (most often) a religious organization.\nBut can I just give away things mentally, you say?\nAccording to Ponder \u2013 no, you can not; and even God says so (Matthew 23:23): \u201cWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices\u2014mint, dill, and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law\u2014justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.\u201d\nThere\u2019s an even deeper reason for giving away parts of your income to an organization respecting God; that way, you prove to yourself that you\u2019re still serving one Master, i.e., God.\nAnd since He is the real source of your money \u2013 Moses says so: \u201cThou shalt remember Jehovah thy God, for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth\u201d (Deuteronomy 8:18) \u2013 He\u2019ll make sure to give twice of that amount back.\nDon\u2019t believe us? \nWell, \n, and he only got richer and richer for that; \u201cGod gave me my money,\u201d said he every time someone asked him \u201cwhy all this charity, John?\u201d (which was, most probably, not once):\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Dynamic Laws of Prosperity\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You Can\u2019t Serve Two Masters \u2013 But You Can Be Rich and Still Serve Just One\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Law of Creative Prosperity and Writing Down Your Desires\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Radiation, Attraction, Tithing, and Circulation\nYou Can\u2019t Serve Two Masters \u2013 But You Can Be Rich and Still Serve Just One\nAccording to the Bible (Matthew 6:24): \u201cNo one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.\u201d\nThis is usually taken to mean that being rich is incompatible with being a good God-serving man. And in case you have any doubts, there\u2019s also that \u201ceye of a needle\u201d story:\n\u201cI tell you the truth,\u201d says Jesus, \u201cit is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God\u201d (Matthew 19:23-26).\nWell, Catherine Ponder is a Unity Church Minister; and \nis a book about money.\nHow does she explain these two quotes?\nWell, she says, neither of the two states that money is bad; both of them suggest that money is bad when it becomes an objective in itself.\nIn other words, if you are too attached to money and want to earn them for their sake, then you\u2019ve forgotten about God; but if you still pray, go to church, and give some of your money away (preferably to God\u2019s organizations on earth), then there\u2019s nothing wrong in earning them.\nThe Law of Creative Prosperity and Writing Down Your Desires\n\u201cThe law of creative prosperity,\u201d writes Catherine Ponder, \u201cis to take your deep-seated desires and, instead of suppressing them as impossible dreams, begin expressing them constructively through deciding what they really are, and then doing something very simple but very powerful about them: write them down!\u201d\nWhy?\nBecause writing down your desires and formulating them in a list or a potential plan, clarifies the desires in your mind, and \u2013 to quote Ponder yet again \u2013 \u201cthe mind produces definite results only when it has been given definite ideas through which to work.\u201d\nLet\u2019s rephrase Ponder for you: the Law of Creative Prosperity is how the Law of Attraction was called half a century ago; and it works best when you are the most specific.\nRadiation, Attraction, Tithing, and Circulation\nThe law of creative prosperity is grounded in the basic law of the universe, says Ponder: in the end, you receive (attract) as much as you give (radiate).\nThat\u2019s why Ponder advises her readers to give away a tenth of their income to the church, thereby proving that they are not serving Mammon but God.\nThis practice is called tithing and is, in itself, merely a corollary of a higher law: the law of circulation.\n\u201cThere is basically one problem in life,\u201d writes Ponder, \u201ccongestion. There is basically one solution: circulation.\u201d\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Dynamic Laws of Prosperity Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nis not your usual get-rich-or-die-trying self-help book; for one, unlike most of them, this one claims that it is both a prosperity and a spiritual guide, deeply grounded in the Bible.\nAnd if you want to earn some dough, then it\u2019s good if you have God on your side, isn\u2019t it?"},
{"title": "Good to Great Summary", "url": "https://blog.12min.com/good-to-great-summary/", "cover": null, "content": "16 min read \u231a\u00a0\n\u00a0is a management book that reveals the formula responsible for companies\u2019 success and their transition from average to unwavering financial performance.\nJim Collins is an American\u00a0business consultant and author. He\u2019s authored six books based on extensive research, including the classic\u00a0\n.\nCollins considers \n\u00a0as a prequel to \n, after noticing that leaders followed the principle of \u2018Good to Great\u2019. That\u2019s why they built companies that last.\nHe shows us the processes these great companies went through and, on the other hand, we also witness how companies that did not take that leap failed to maintain steady growth.\n\u201cGood to Great Summary\u201d\n identifies eleven great companies and compares them to other similar companies which failed to attain great growth.\nCollins introduces new management concepts, such as Level 5 Leaders, the Hedgehog Concept, and the Culture of Discipline, which are essential to the success of good-to-great companies.\n is divided into 9 chapters, which represent the key elements of the book:\nChapter 1 \u2013 Good is the Enemy of Great.\nChapter 2 \u2013 Level 5 \nChapter 3 \u2013 First Who\u2026 Then What\nChapter 4 \u2013 Confront The Brutal Facts (Yet Never Lose Faith)\nChapter 5 \u2013 The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles)\nChapter 6 \u2013 A \nChapter 7 \u2013\u00a0\nChapter 8 \u2013 The Flywheel and The Doom Loop\nChapter 9 \u2013 From Good To Great To Built To Last\nLet\u2019s start with the very first chapter, which is organized around the idea of Good vs. Great.\u00a0It seems that:\nAccording to Jim Collins, most people prefer to settle for good instead of wanting to become great, simply because it\u2019s easier. As long as you don\u2019t want to push your limits, you\u2019ll never discover what you\u2019re truly capable of, and you may never discover your great qualities.\nGood is indeed the enemy of most companies. They\u2019re so used to being good that they don\u2019t even try to become great, to excel in their industry.\nAnd this is when other companies take over. Why? Because \n want to be the best in the industry.\nBeing the best means that there won\u2019t be any room left for mediocre thinking.\u00a0Why settle for good when you can become great?\nCollins introduces a new concept, Level 5 Leadership. During a five-year study, he and his team noticed that every single great company had the same type of leader.\nModesty and ambition play a great role in the Level 5 leader\u2019s life. All the Level 5 leaders Collins studied were modest.\nThey never said that company\u2019s success was due to them, but to their employees and good luck.\n, they were focused on producing results, doing everything within their power for the greater good of the company, with stoic determination.\n, even after they were no longer in charge. They made sure to train their successor, ensuring that the company will survive even after they\u2019ll be long gone.\nSo how do you recognize a Level 5 leader?\nWhat I liked about this book is the fact that it gives practical advice. It teaches us how to become Level 5 leaders if we\u2019re Level 4 leaders. This is very useful for leaders who wish to become great leaders.\n(function(d,id){if(d.getElementById(id))return;var scr=d.createElement(\u2018script\u2019);scr.src=\u2019https://widget.\n.com/v0.2.0/widget.js\u2019;scr.id=id;d.body.appendChild(scr);})(document,\u201912min-widget-sdk\u2019);window.twelveminInit=function twelveminInit(){};\n\nFirst Who\u2026 Then What is a great way to talk about the people that you want in your life and at work. These Good-to-Great companies followed this principle.\nIn order to have a successful business, you must decide who you wish to be surrounded by, and which people should no longer be present in your company. Then you can decide the direction in which you\u2019ll be heading.\nThe Good-to-Great companies first decided which people should be on board and which not.\nAccording to Collins, as long as you have the right people with you, you will be more successful as a company as you won\u2019t waste time and energy motivating people. \n. They know how to do their tasks and they don\u2019t need somebody to push them in the right direction.\nAnother essential concept that I found in\u00a0\n\u00a0is confronting the most brutal facts of your current reality. It\u2019s something you have to do If you wish to be successful.\u00a0What does this mean?\nYou must acknowledge the reality that surrounds you and face the facts.\u00a0 Be honest. \n, without ever losing hope. Take a look at the companies that are the best in your field, and see if you can overtake them. If you can\u2019t, find something else you can be the best at.\nThe Hedgehog Concept refers to seeing what is essential and ignoring the rest. All Level 5 Leaders created a Hedgehog concept for their companies. All their decisions were based on simple concepts.\nThe Hedgehog Concept consists of three overlapping circles, in the form of questions:\nWhat can you be the best in the world at?\nWhat drives your economic engine?\n?\nIn order to succeed, you need all these overlapping circles. It may be a bit uncomfortable to ask yourself what can I be the best at and what I can\u2019t be best at in this world, but it helps in the long run.\nThis concept can be applied in our everyday life. In order to succeed in any industry, you have to be the best at it, but you also need to be passionate about it, otherwise, you won\u2019t be able to stay on top. If it doesn\u2019t make economic sense, you won\u2019t produce great results.\nDiscipline is another key element found in all good-to-great companies.\u00a0As long as you have self-disciplined people, they will do everything possible to accomplish the company\u2019s goal.\u00a0This may be true, but I believe that nowadays it can be difficult to find \n. Let\u2019s face it, the world is changing rapidly and we tend to lose focus; distractions seem to appear out of nowhere.\nThink about the people you work with. Are they disciplined?\nTechnology Accelerators is new technology that is used by good-to-great companies. These good-to-great companies used new technology within the three circles of the Hedgehog Concept. Technology by itself cannot stimulate performance growth.\nThe last chapter, \u201cFrom Good to Great to Built to Last\u201d, tells us that if the advice in \n\u00a0is followed we can build something to last. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this book is a prequel to \n.\nCare to read it?\nThe real performance of a company can only be seen over time, when its first leader, the one responsible for its success, is long gone but the company maintains its success. That means that Level 5 leaders have passed on their knowledge in a remarkable way.\n helped me realize that we don\u2019t have to settle for less. We don\u2019t have to be just \u201cgood\u201d when we can become \u201cgreat\u201d.\n\u201cGood to Great\u201d is Jim Collins\u2019s bestseller, which builds on the results of a multi-company study and presents countless real-world examples of companies that went from mediocre or even bad to excellent.\nThe study aimed to answer the following question: Can companies challenge logic and remain excellent over a long period? If so, what are the common characteristics that drive these companies out of mediocrity to success?\nTo do this, the author analyzed financial data, articles and an extensive corporate information database of \n.\nHe also conducted hundreds of interviews with executives of these companies and the result, you find here, summarized in this microbook.\nIn this book, Jim Collins shows us how companies can achieve lasting quality and remain at a level of excellence. Let\u2019s find out the secrets of winning companies?\nConfront The Truth About Your Company\nEvery successful company that has reached success got there by evaluating and accepting their current situation, even if it was a bad one.\nCollins found that these companies did not necessarily have very good or bad conditions.\nSome were worse, some better, but the successful ones were those who valued and accepted their circumstances.\nA great example is a comparison between Kroger and A&P. These \n faced a change in the market, where consumers wanted bigger and larger stores with a wider variety of products.\nBoth invested in smaller, more traditional stores that were not compatible with the cravings of new consumers.\nBut while Kroger accepted this reality and worked to remedy the problem, A&P refused to admit the facts and react.\nKroger changed and replaced each of its stores. The result was a success for Kroger. A&P was stubborn, kept the existing models and quickly stepped out of the top.\nFor the best strategy to be applied, it is very important \n. And confronting the truth means encouraging honest and open discussions.\nFacing the facts can be a very difficult and disheartening process, but if your company creates the right environment to discuss problems and solutions, you can motivate employees to succeed.\nLeaders need to be willing to ask questions and promote conversations without monopolizing or refusing to accept contributions. Also, \n can not point the finger and blame others for problems.\nWhen a problem comes up, make it a priority. If someone has a good suggestion, use it and credit that person for the idea. Find out where the mistake lies, without blaming anyone for it.\nBut, above all, hold onto the belief that no matter how bad things are, in the end, the company will come to success.\nBut do not stop there, because optimism without the knowledge of truth only leads to failure.\nKeep faith in success, but simultaneously confront the reality of your situation and act accordingly.\nThis contradiction is called Stockdale\u2019s Paradox and is the key to greatness. You need to have faith that you will achieve success, but also be honest with yourself about the current situation and be willing to take action.\nFollow The Hedgehog Concept\nThe simplest solution to a problem is always the best output. So you need a clear plan to achieve your company goals, and that\u2019s what Jim Collins calls the Hedgehog Concept.\nBut after all, what is the Hedgehog Concept? It is based on a story of a duel between a fox and a hedgehog.\nIn this story, the Fox wants to catch the hedgehog. The fox is an intelligent, agile animal that is capable of attacking in several different ways.\nOn the other hand, the Hedgehog is not recognized for its cleverness. It only knows how to do one thing, very well.\nYour only strategy is to become a ball of thorns and roll as fast as possible. Regardless of Fox\u2019s attack, the hedgehog always wins and manages to escape.\nMore than a strategy, it is an understanding of the situation. \n know how to do something deeply and focus on it.\nCompanies that are not made to win tend to act more like the fox. They do many things but lack consistency.\nThe Collins Hedgehog concept is based on three fundamental ideas that big companies combine to find their way to excellence.\nJim and his researchers found that every company that achieved success followed that concept.\nThe theory is that any action taken by your company or employees needs to meet all three ideas at once or it will not be successful.\nThe first idea is that you need to identify your passion. Companies that achieve excellence have a deep knowledge of their passions. Without passion, companies can not get very far.\nThe second idea is to identify what you can do better than anyone else in the world. Whatever it is, it needs to be the focus of your business. That is the only way to succeed.\nFinally, companies must identify how they can profit in the most effective way possible and how to capture more value from their market.\nOne of the key functions of a business is to generate revenue, and all companies that have achieved excellence were able to identify the best way to capture value in their market.\nThese companies have discovered how to be economically \n.\nTo do this, changes need to happen. For example, the Walgreens drugstore chain also owned restaurants. Instead of continuing with both deals, the owners chose to focus on the best investment and left the food service.\nThe drugstores were a smart economic choice, and CEO Charles R. Cork Walgreen III achieved success.\nTo work effectively within these three ideas, you must have disciplined employees, and the reward for that is to achieve excellence.\nKeep Discipline In Your Organization\nHaving discipline and using it as a key concept in your company is another essential ingredient to a company\u2019s success.\nDiscipline does not mean that leaders will lead as dictators. It means that employees at all levels have self-discipline and know what needs to be done and how to do it.\nPeople with self-discipline are more competent and capable, as well as knowing how to keep things going.\nA great company is full of people who know how to lead themselves. Each employee is responsible for themselves and their attitudes, and there are no incompetent people who need a nanny.\nDisciplined people operate without deviating from the plan and know that following a strategy is the key to success.\nBuilding a sketch based on the three basic principles of the hedgehog concept and giving your employees the freedom and responsibility to work within their boundaries is essential.\nDisciplined people will follow the plan and fulfill all of their responsibilities, no matter the circumstances.\nAlso, leaders will not need to boss their subordinates or discuss their failures. When that happens, you will have reached the disciplined culture in the company, just as all the companies in Collins\u2019s study have achieved to become excellent.\nThat is one of the common aspects that success stories have.\nDisciplined professionals in a company that moves to excellence will be disciplined both about their thoughts and attitudes.\nEvery thought they have and every decision they make for the company will be exclusive to fulfill the three principles, even if it means failing to seize great opportunities. Following the plan is the goal.\nWhen leaders understand this, they can begin to study \n and which ones need to be eliminated immediately. If you find behavior that does not work, it needs to be stopped.\nHire The Right People And Fire The Inefficient Ones\nFor a company to change from good to excellent, it should not only hire the best and most disciplined but also dismiss those who do not agree with the new direction.\nMany companies that failed to achieve excellence had inefficient employees in key positions and did not bring the right people to work for their team.\nIf a company wants to achieve success, it should start by hiring the best and the brightest.\nSometimes there may not be a clear position for them within the company, but it is important to keep them ready for when the goals are well defined.\nAn example was when Wells Fargo CEO Dick Cooley set up his team.\nHe was worried about finding the best. He later found positions in the company for them. That is the priority: first to find the best people; What you do with them comes later.\nThe less successful companies often decide first what to do and then find people \u2013 but this fragile system will eventually collapse.\nThese companies have a single quality leader leading a large number of subordinates who can only receive orders.\nIf this person leaves the company for some reason, they leave a problem to be solved. That\u2019s exactly what happened when executive Jack Eckerd left Eckerd Corporation.\nYou must remember that the company \n and that the wrong people need to be let go.\nDo not hire anyone who does not have a place in the company in the future.\nMake sure every employee is exactly where he should be and that you put the best where they should be. The right team will work together to find the best path and continue on it.\nUse Technology In Your Favor\nIf your company is going to implement new technology, it must be carefully selected and have a well-defined purpose.\nNew technologies without a purpose are a waste of time, effort, and money. As we will see below, Walgreens understood this when online pharmacies began to emerge.\nSo instead of hurrying, they carefully considered a plan of action. Technology is a tool used by large companies to get organizations to achieve their goals.\nIf technology does not fit the three basic principles of the Hedgehog Concept, then it should not be used, no matter how popular it may be in the industry.\nNew technologies do not create organizational movements or success, but rather help develop what already exists, and then have a clear role in the company\u2019s action plan.\nAs mentioned before, Walgreens was not sure \n, so they did not rush to use it.\nInstead, they conducted experiments first to understand how it worked and only then began to use it, promoting convenience, as with filling in online revenue.\nFinally, after studying and having a clear idea of how a site would help in its goals, Walgreens became a 100% online pharmacy, achieving success.\nMeanwhile, other online pharmacies failed quickly and paved the way for Walgreens.\nA company that achieves excellence will not be pressured into using any technology.\nInstead, \u00a0carefully consider how it should be used and \n the chance to think of innovative strategies that will differentiate the company from their competitors and help the company achieve its goals.\nA mediocre company will immediately use new technologies for no purpose, afraid of becoming outdated.\nHave Humble Hardworking Leaders\nCollins and his team hoped to discover that the most charismatic and famous executives would be the ones who brought their companies to excellence, but in fact, the most effective leaders were modest and reserved.\nThrough articles and personal interviews with those involved, they found that the \n were humble and worked hard.\nHis research team found that every great company possessed an exceptional leader during the periods of transition to excellence.\nExceptional leaders are not egocentric as the leaders of mediocre businesses. An exceptional leader cares only about the company\u2019s success, even if it does not receive credit for it.\nThey do not want the company to fail when they leave, and they do worry about having excellent succession plans for when their exit happens.\nThey seem calm because of their more reserved nature, but they also have professional ambitions.\nBut these ambitions are directed to the company and not to themselves.\nThese leaders will do everything for the success of the company, no matter how difficult.\nFor them, the goal is to train other leaders to achieve even greater success, even if it leaves them overshadowed by their successors.\nChoosing a shallow leader for the company is a mistake many mediocre businesses make, as was Scott Paper with Al Dunlap.\nHe shouted about his accomplishments, but his company was then bought by \n Darwin Smith of Kimberly-Clark.\nA great leader should be a great collaborator and not an exhibitionist.\nExceptional leaders see potential everywhere. A median leader can become exceptional by learning to take responsibility for his mistakes and to credit the company and people with the right answers.\nExceptional leaders look to others when things work out and give recognition to their teams. Mediocre leaders do the opposite and like to appear.\nAlways Follow The Principles of The Hedgehog Concept\nOnly a select number of companies achieve success, and an even smaller number remain in a state of excellence.\nThe trick is to keep the formula for excellence as business conditions change over the years.\nCollins calls the methods he discovered in his research of \u201cphysics\u201d that remains over the years to generate the shift from \u2018good\u2019 to \u2018excellent\u2019.\nNo matter how much the economy and market change, these methods can be applied to achieve and maintain excellence.\nThe process comes down to always having the best people possible in the right places and maintaining a constant conversation about the state of affairs, including areas that need improvement.\nBy honestly admitting where the failures are, a company begins to improve and prevent disasters.\nBy maintaining discipline in following the principles of the Hedgehog Concept chosen for your company and achieving and redefining your goals over time, you can remain in the state of excellence.\nSucceed in Your Company\nStudying various data, Collins and his team found impressive results.\nBut the fact is that the process by which these companies went on to achieve success took years of dedicated and disciplined work and each employee \n.\nThe results can be fantastic, but the road to get there is long.\nCompanies go through a gradual development until they reach excellence and there is no way to define when this process is over.\nOne day the company will realize that it has achieved its goals and that it has \n.\nThe fact is it does not happen quickly, and companies that never achieve excellence often try to accelerate the path to success with poor results.\nCombining two mediocre businesses into one acquisition will not generate an excellent company. It will only create more of the same, and sometimes it can even make things worse.\nUsually, a successful company does not make big acquisitions until it has changed from \u2018good\u2019 to \u2018excellent\u2019.\nExcellent companies follow a pattern, while good ones inevitably follow another pattern.\nCollins calls this the great pendulum pattern, which leads the organization to advance until it reaches the ideal point.\nThe mediocre pattern is a cycle that does not care about the company\u2019s necessary development and fails to reach the ideal point.\nYou can not rush to perfection.

PDF Summary\u201d\nIt\u2019s common to interrogate children about their dream job when they grew up. The answers are common, too: firefighter, policeman, doctor, and so on. But if we were to ask them later on in their early adulthood, I\u2019m sure their answer would be Richard Branson.\nMany of us adults see just the glamorous side of a \n: private island, private jet, exotic travels. We might not want to deal a business of this size, but are we willing to put in the effort and work for a smaller one? Now we have a very good opportunity to find out.\nEntrepreneurship is the future of the economy. Books, blogs, podcasts, and presentations all teach how what, and for who to start a business. Patrick Flynn is a successful businessman, with many achievements to his name.\nHe\u2019s a speaker, a podcaster with famous guests, a website owner, and now the author of \n. His expertise is mainly counseling for online businesses.\nFULFILLED IDEAS / WILL IT FLY?\nAnd because business is the future, we must learn how to do it.\nThere is a saying, always take advice from those who succeeded. We need to follow in the right footsteps.\n\u00a0teaches us test our next business idea so we don\u2019t waste time and money. Pat Flynn\u2019s book is a technical, meticulous piece on how to construct a successful business from an idea.\nFlynn is driven by data; his phrases are short, straightforward, and his book has many resource materials.\nIt\u2019s easy to say \u201clet\u2019s get rich\u201d. But how we get started?\nTo thrive in a business, we must work hard. It\u2019s a long road from an idea to the business itself. We must begin with a plan that gives us direction, that shows us what \u2013 and who \u2013 is important to us: family, job, health?\nThings that are important to us can help map that road, our idea, and how to put it into practice. Herein lies the key to success.\nBut what makes\u00a0\nstand out from its many, many peers?\nIt\u2019s filled with shared secrets, tips, and valuable information that wasn\u2019t previously revealed to the business-avid public. Flynn\u2019s approach is different, deeper, more human. Until now business was all about marketing, selling the product, and counting the income.\nFlynn warns that there are other important aspects to consider if we want to have a functional business. Like having a more human approach towards your customers: knowing very well what they want, and being fair to them if the product doesn\u2019t make them happy.\nThe values we learn from\u00a0\nwill help us be successful.\u00a0After all, it\u2019s value that sells.\nIt starts by making a so-called mind map; to how to identify clients; how to put the products on the market or to collect pre-orders.

We have the opportunity to learn from a specialist in all sorts of different business domains.\nThese specialists were former guests on Flynn\u2019s podcast. Every effort is made to give the reader \n.\nWe learn from the book, we listen to all the council. But is this enough to reach for the stars?\nKnowledge on its own won\u2019t help us communicate and adjust our leadership style when conducting our team.\nPat Flynn\u2019s \n\u00a0explains why we must be prepared for these challenges \u2013 after all, we\u2019re going to work with people, not just numbers. Building a close relationship with customers is a high priority for a successful business.\nAlso, in Flynn\u2019s opinion, a businessman must know:\nBottom line: the future consists of personal development and private businesses. But we must give the clients exactly what they want. And we can\u2019t be selfish. Aiming to get rich fast won\u2019t work in the long run.\nEven if we won\u2019t have the result we want, the experience itself is priceless. As psychology states, there are character traits and skills that are developed only through resilience.\nPutting ourselves through that process can offer us \n and, in the end, we\u2019ll know ourselves much better.\nAnd who knows? Our next attempt\u00a0might just be our best.\nI consider Pat Flynn\u2019s \n\u00a0incredibly useful for any budding entrepreneurs. But even though we might read hundreds of books on the subject, we must still ask ourselves: can I learn how to be a real business owner from a book?\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free\u00a0\n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cWill it Fly?

And Why?\nIf you love the smell of napalm\u2026 oh, sorry \u2013 old books in the morning; if you prefer a cozy afternoon with a novel tucked under a blanket to a crazy night at a techno club; if you\u2019ve got an allergy to dust, and yet can\u2019t help visiting the local library at least once a week ever since your student days \u2013 then \n will strike a few chords in your heart\n\u201cA dazzling love letter to a beloved institution\u201d and \u201can investigation into one of its greatest mysteries\u201d (\n), \nis the book for every book lover out there; especially the hundreds of thousands of members of the Los Angeles Public Library.\nAbout Susan Orlean\n is an American journalist and bestselling author, hailed as \u201cnational treasure\u201d by several publications.\nOrlean has been a staff writer for \never since 1992 and has authored eight books so far, including \n, and\n.\nHowever, she is best known for her second book, \n, which was adapted by Charlie Kaufmann for Spike Jonze\u2019s Academy Award-winning film \n, where Orlean was played by none other than Meryl Streep.\nFind out more at \n. \n\u201cThe Library Book PDF Summary\u201d\n\u201cIn Senegal,\u201d writes Susan Orlean at the end of Chapter 8 of \n,\n\u201cthe polite expression for saying someone died is to say his or her library has burned.\u201d\nAnd then she goes on:\nNow, if each individual is a private library, then actual libraries are nothing less than the DNA of a whole culture, if not the human civilization itself.\nAnd that\u2019s why Susan Orlean\u2019s extraordinary book, \n, turns from an investigation of the great 1986 Los Angeles Public Library fire into \u201can exercise in mining her intense feelings\u201d for the subject of books and libraries (to quote \n\u2019 review for \n).\nIt\u2019s almost as if she uses the fire, Lewis says, as a MacGuffin, \u201ca trick for luring the reader into a subject into which the reader never imagined he\u2019d be lured: the history and present life of the Los Angeles Central Library.\u201d\n\u201cSusan Orlean\u2019s new book,\u201d says \n, \u201cis like exploring the stacks of a library, where something unexpected and interesting can be discovered on every page.\u201d\nHere are the bits which impressed us the most.\nThe \u201cExtraordinary and Unforgettable\u201d Fire\nUnbeknownst to many at the time, April 29, 1986, was the day of \u201cone of the biggest fires in the history of Los Angeles;\u201d coincidentally, it was also \u201cthe single biggest library fire in the history of the United States.\u201d\nAnd it consumed large parts of the Central Library in downtown Los Angeles. \nTo this day, nobody knows what and why had caused it; but many LA firefighters still remember it the most uncommon and fiercest fire they ever had to face.\n\u201cIt was a huge, furious fire that burned for more than seven hours and reached temperatures of 2000 degrees,\u201d informs us Orlean. \nIt wasn\u2019t red and orange and yellow and black, but colorless and somewhere pale blue; it was so hot that it appeared icy; three decades later, Ron Hamel, then-captain in the fire department, remembers that everybody around him thought that they were looking at the bowels of hell.\nMore than fifty firefighters were injured while trying to put out the fire; over 400,000 books were completely and irretrievably destroyed; at least 700,000 more were substantially damaged.\nAnd yet \u2013 \nEven if you were living in LA at the time, you probably wouldn\u2019t have heard much about this.\nBecause around the same time, about 10,000km to the east, a nuclear reactor melted down in Chernobyl, causing not only environmental concerns but also a stock market crash.\nIn fact, \ndidn\u2019t even bother to mention to fire until a day after; and even then, it was just a brief story published on page A14, laying out the basic facts and sharing the opinions of a few local residents.\nChernobyl won. \n\u201cThe books burned,\u201d writes Orlean, \u201cwhile most of us were waiting to see if we were about to witness the end of the world.\u201d\nThe Act of Burning Books\nAs we said above, nobody knows, to this day, who or what had caused the 1986 fire in the Los Angeles Public Library.\nThe main \u2013 and basically only \u2013 suspect was a struggling attention-seeking actor named Harry Peak; but he was let go soon after being imprisoned due to lack of evidence.\nDuring the fire, everything in the Fiction section from A through L was destroyed; consequently, that included all of Ray Bradbury\u2019s books, including the one you\u2019re inclined to think about every time book burning is mentioned, \n.\nOrlean uses the fire and the loss of over one million invaluable books to ask some important questions about the nature of books and about the act of burning them.\nIf it was Harry Peak or another arsonist who had caused the fire, why did he do it?\nAnd there\u2019s a reason for that: humans, just as that Senegalese phrase quoted above suggests, are pretty much like books.\n\u201cTaking books away from a culture is to take away its shared memory,\u201d writes Orlean. \u201cIt\u2019s like taking away the ability to remember your dreams. Destroying a culture\u2019s books is sentencing it to something worse than death: It is sentencing it to seem as if it never lived.\u201d\nBuilding Libraries Is Not Unlike Building Civilizations\nis a love letter not only to the Los Angeles Public Library but to public libraries everywhere on the planet.\nAt least as far as Orlean is concerned, they are, in a way, not only the reason why we can call ourselves civilized but also the embodiment of hope, the symbol of the power of the human connection.\n\u201cThe library is a whispering post,\u201d says Orlean both poetically and powerfully: \nOrlean admits that after thinking about this, she realized that the very existence of \nowes everything to this kind of reasoning.\nWe always write because we hope that we\u2019ll be able \u201cto tell a long-lasting story, to create something that endured, to be alive somehow as long as someone would read [our stories].\u201d\nIn view of this, it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that libraries are our most powerful weapon against Death and Hate, the pinnacle of our attempt to create a global human civilization.\nThe Google of Days Past: Let\u2019s Just Call the Library\nWhen you have a dilemma or a question nowadays, you ask Google about it.\nWell, until not that long ago, in similar cases, people had no choice but to contact libraries\u2019 reference departments. \nThe one in LA\u2019s Central Library was called SCAN, short for the Southern California Answering Network and was pretty popular both locally and nationally.\nHere are some of the records:\n\u2022\n\u2022\nEven today, the phones in the library constantly ring: not everybody knows how to use the Internet.\nHere\u2019s a funny reaction overheard by Orlean just recently after one such call: \u201cWhy would someone call here and ask, \u2018Which is more evil, grasshoppers or crickets?\u2019\u201d\nA Few Interesting People\nThere are many exceptionally interesting people who populate the pages of \nOne of them Harry Peak, the guy accused of starting the fire. Tall, blond, and dimpled, Peak was nothing short of a fantasist, \u201ca storyteller, a yarn-spinner, and an agile liar.\u201d\nHe was so good and quick at imagining and fabricating stories about his life that, according to his sister, even his family didn\u2019t believe a word he says.\nCase in point: after admitting to starting the fire, Harry offered no fewer than seven different alibis; many firefighters believed none of them he was arrested but not indicted.\nHere he is after his release from jail.\nGene Scott is another colorful character which appears on the pages of Orlean\u2019s book, a Stanford Ph.D. and a pastor, \u201cthe most agnostic believer and the most believing agnostic.\u201d \nHowever, neither his cigar-smoking sermons backed by scantily clad women nor the telethon he organized to raise millions for the library\u2019s reconstruction compares to one of LA\u2019s early librarians, Mr. Charles Fletcher Lummis, \u201ca journalist, poet, editor, historian, and adventurer.\u201d\nAnd, oh, so much more!\n, but here are three things we couldn\u2019t help but sharing with you now:\n\u2022 The man wanted to improve the tastes of LA citizens; to do so, he hired a blacksmith to make \u201cbranding iron in the shape of a skull and crossbones\u201d which he then used to brand the frontispiece of pseudoscientific books;\n\u2022 He created a group of alt-librarians who are not \u201cpompous asses;\u201d he called the group \n, aka \u201cLibrarians Who Are Nevertheless Human;\u201d each member had a Bibliosmiles nickname; Lummis\u2019 was \u201cGrim Reality;\u201d\n\u2022 Outside the library, Lummis often organized lavish parties for writers at his house called El Alisal; yup, they included troubadours and prostitutes!\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Library Book\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 1986 Los Angeles Public Library Fire\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Books and Libraries, the Cultural DNA\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How to Steal a Book: the Hollywood Edition\nThe 1986 Los Angeles Public Library Fire\nOn April 29, 1986, three days after the Chernobyl Disaster, the Central Public Library in Los Angeles caught fire, one of the biggest in the history of Los Angeles.\nSince the library was built before architects knew enough about ventilation of heat and smoke, the fire was both difficult to put out and devastating.\n\u201cAlmost every firefighter in Los Angeles was called upon to fight the fire,\u201d and yet \u2013 it took them more than seven hours to put it out.\nThe cost?\nMore than 50 firefighters were injured, and more than one million books were either destroyed or damaged.\nEven though a wannabe actor was blamed for it \u2013 a certain Harry Peak \u2013 to this day, it is not known who or what had caused it.\nBooks and Libraries, the Cultural DNA\nRemember \n?\nOf course you do: it\u2019s Ray Bradbury\u2019s dystopian novel, the most famous one treating the topic of book burning.\nIf you have read it \u2013 or watched Francois Truffaut\u2019s adaptation \u2013 you know that by the end of the story, books and people become indistinguishable: to save the civilization from destruction, and build it anew when it becomes necessary, intellectuals have started memorizing important classics by heart.\nOrlean highlights countless times the fact that this is more than a metaphor or a recipe for a new society:\nBy the way \u2013 and suitably \u2013 Orlean uses a sentence from \n as an epigraph to her book: \u201cAnd when they ask us what we\u2019re doing, you can say, \n\u201d\nHow to Steal a Book: the Hollywood Edition\nAmong the many interesting stories inside Susan Orlean\u2019s book, there\u2019s one that really caught our attention.\nNamely, it seems that, contrary to what you\u2019d expect, the poor and the disillusioned weren\u2019t the ones the library officials feared when it came to the subject of stealing books.\nFascinatingly enough \u2013 the greatest threat was Hollywood. \u201cFor years,\u201d writes Orlean, \u201cmovie studios were major book-pinching culprits.\u201d \nWhy would they do that?\nTwo main reasons:\n#1. There was no Internet at the time, and the libraries were the only place where screenwriters could find material for their research;\n#2. When you check out a book, there\u2019s a due date to return it \u2013 and you don\u2019t want scheduling conflicts which could cause you millions because of administration, do you?\nHow did they do it?\nIt was a simple scheme, involving two assistants, one of which would take a position outside a window with the other pitching the desired book out to window to his accomplice. \nAnd this happened so often that the library had to hire an employee whose main job was to regularly visit film studios and get the stolen books back.\nAlso, the library had no choice but to wire shut all the windows most often used for the scheme.\nHollywood! Go figure!\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Library Book Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nThere are two things you should know about us:\n#1. We like books;\n#2. We love libraries.\nkept\nreminding us why \u2013 from cover to cover.\nCaptivating, delightful, a constant pleasure to read, \nis a heartfelt and moving masterpiece which, in the end, seems to be about everything but the LA Public Library fire: memory and books, mothers and daughters, our need to not be forgotten.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t help but finish \n,\u201d writes Ron Charles for \n, \u201cand feel grateful that these marvelous places belong to us all.\u201d\nIndeed, you can\u2019t."},

This means blocking off a large chunk of time every day for creative work on your own priorities, with the phone and e-mail off.\u201d\nThis is how you can do this:\n\u2022 Notice when you seem to have the most energy during the day, and dedicate those valuable periods to your most important creative work;\n\u2022 \n;\n\u2022 Manage/limit your daily to-do list;\n\u2022 Train yourself to record every commitment you make somewhere that will make it impossible to forget;\n\u2022 Set a start time and a finish time for your workday\u2014even if you work alone; dedicate different times of day to different activities.\nGretchen Rubin, the author of not \n, but \n with happy titles and baroque subtitles, says that as a writer, she works every single day, including weekends, holidays, and vacations.\nWhy?\nBecause the key to making things easier for you is making them more frequent.\nAccording to Gretchen, frequency has a lot of benefits.\nThese are the main ones:\n\u2022 it makes starting easier;\n\u2022 it keeps ideas fresh;\n\u2022 it keeps the pressure off;\n\u2022 it sparks creativity;\n\u2022 it nurtures frequency;\n\u2022 it fosters productivity.\nAll in all, frequency is a \napproach, because, in life, there will always be numerous pressing obligations from your job and your family; this is the only way to face them without sacrificing your creativity and productivity.\nIn \u201cHoning Your Creative Practice,\u201d \n answers some of the burning routine-related questions, such as \u201cWhat\u2019s the hardest part about getting a daily routine right?\u201d and \u201cHow do you keep your short-term work aligned with your long-term objectives?\u201d\nIt\u2019s Seth Godin, so \u2013 you\u2019ve got to read the answers!\nTony Schwartz, president and CEO of the Energy Project and the author of \nand \n, reminds us \u2013 through the story of a fictional creative director of a large agency named Zeke \u2013 that our capacity is limited.\nConsequently, no routine would work if it doesn\u2019t include renewal, i.e., moments to recharge your batteries; yes, we\u2019re talking about getting regular sleep, breaks, and walks.\nYou won\u2019t make it without them.\nThere\u2019s a reason why Leo Babauta begins his article with a quote by Henry David Thoreau: he believes that in the loud world of today, \u201ceven a small time set aside for solitude each day \u2013 from twenty minutes to an hour \u2013 can make an enormous difference.\u201d\nBut, hey, you should have expected such an advice of Babauta: he is the author of \n, one of the seminal books on minimalism.\nChapter Two \u2013 Finding Focus in a Distracted World\n\u201cIn a world filled with distraction,\u201d writes Glei, \u201cattention is our competitive advantage. Look at each day as a challenge \u2013 and an opportunity \u2013 to keep your eye on the prize.\u201d\nCal Newport \u2013 the author of \n, \n, and \n \u2013 is a professor at Georgetown University, torn between his creative assignments and his constantly overflowing Inbox.\nHis solution?\nDaily focus blocks and resisting distraction.\nIn practice, this means no e-mail, no Internet, and no phone for a specific amount of time at a specific location \u2013 no matter what!\nCongratulations: now you have a creative corner.\nChristian Jarrett is a psychologist, so he should know best how your mind works.\nAnd as far as he is concerned, the first thing you need to understand if you want to find focus in the distracted world of today is that there\u2019s no such thing as multitasking.\nIn other words, it\u2019s either \n or no task.\nScience guarantees.\nDan Ariely is fascinated with the irrational so much that he\u2019s written some of the best-known and best-loved books related to it: \n, \n, and \n.\nNaturally, in this Q&A, he answers question related to the hidden motivations and temptations that lurk behind our decisions \u2013 and offers some tricks and tweaks on how to master them.\nIn addition to being an advocate for simple living, Erin Rooney Doland is editor-in-chief at unclutterer.com and author of the book \n.\nHer advice?\nLife is never going to be a walk in the park, so, if you want to produce something worthwhile, you\u2019ll need to find a way to produce it amidst chaos.\nThat means mindful (and not mindless) work and, more importantly, a lot of self-control.\nScott Belsky makes another appearance, this time as an author of an article which promotes living in the now as the only way to achieve something.\nBeing present should be your priority, he says, and this means that you should:\n\u2022 Be aware of the cost of constant connection;\n\u2022 Recognize when you\u2019re tuning in to the stream for the wrong reasons;\n\u2022 Create windows of non-stimulation in your day;\n\u2022 Listen to your gut as much as you listen to others; and\n\u2022 Stay open to the possibilities of serendipity.\nChapter Three \u2013 Taming Your Tools\n\u201cTechnology should be a tool,\u201d reminds us Jocelyne Glei, \u201cbut if we do not keep our wits about us, it can easily become our taskmaster.\u201d\nHere are ways you can keep things under control.\nAh, that dreaded e-mail Inbox! \nAccording to a recent study, the average knowledge worker spends about third of his week (28%) either writing, reading, or responding to e-mail.\nIf you want to turn this around, Aaron Dignan says, then you better:\n\u2022 Become aware of your complex goals and tape a list of them to your desk so that it serves to you as a constant reminder;\n\u2022 Make your complex goals a priority and rummage through your Inbox with this in mind;\n\u2022 Let things go: let\u2019s face it, there will never be enough time for you to read all of those starred articles; it\u2019s time that you go all Frozen on them!\nHere are three more bits of advice related to your Internet presence coming from Lori Deschene, the founder of tinybuddha.com:\n\u2022 Log on with intention \u2013 when browsing Facebook becomes the first thing you do when bored, then it is bad;\n\u2022 Become aware \u2013 without self-awareness of why you use Facebook or Twitter, you are merely their slave;\n\u2022 Find a purpose, esteem, and form a meaningful connection.\nTiffany Shlain, the woman behind the acclaimed documentary \n, waltzes through the \u201cTaming Your Tools\u201d Q&A quite strongly, suggesting not only a \u201ctechnology shabbat\u201d from time to time, but also heeding to a powerful Socrates\u2019 quote: \u201cNothing vast enters the life of mortals without a curse.\u201d\nAlways remember: the Internet brings a lot of good stuff \u2013 but it costs you many other things as well.\nLinda Stone is the woman who has coined the terms \u201ccontinuous partial attention,\u201d \u201ce-mail apnea,\u201d \u201cscreen apnea,\u201d and \u201cconscious computing.\u201d\nAnd, in a way, all of them boil down to this: we haven\u2019t evolved to use the technology in a way which will not cause us anxiety; we\u2019re still too young and inexperienced.\nStone calls the new set of skills we must acquire to \u201cembody\u201d when we use technology \u201cconscious computing.\u201d\nAnd she says that diaphragmatic breathing, Buteyko breathing, martial arts, and yoga (pranayama) breathing are a great start in the right direction.\nIn \u201cReclaiming Our Self-Respect,\u201d James Victore notes that the crux of the problem of the modern world is that we\u2019ve lost the distinction between urgent and important. \n\u201cWhen we choose urgent over important,\u201d he says, \u201cwhat we are really choosing is other people\u2019s priorities over our own.\u201d\nAnd he goes on: \u201cWith every new e-mail, we become like leaves in the wind, reacting to any breeze willy-nilly. We quickly set aside our own concerns to attend to those of others. This busywork pulls our attention from the meaningful work\u2014taking time to think, reflect, and imagine.\u201d\nThe last three are the things which really make you human; and the things you need to take back by force from the technology of today and, thus, reclaim your self-respect.\nChapter Four \u2013 Sharpening Your Creative Mind\nThe five articles in the fourth and last chapter of \n offer a few pieces of advice on \u201chow to push to creative blocks and keep the aha moments coming.\u201d\nTodd Henry\u2019s article is a paean to Unnecessary Creation, aka creating for the most important audience of all: yourself.\nAccording to Henry, these are the three (necessary) benefits of Unnecessary Creation:\n\u2022 Unnecessary Creation gives you the freedom to explore new possibilities and follow impractical curiosities.\n\u2022 Unnecessary Creation allows you to take risks and develop new skills that can later be applied to your on-demand creating.\n\u2022 Unnecessary Creation provides a forum for the pursuit of voice, and a reminder that you are not the sum of what you make.\nScott McDowell tries to tackle one of the most difficult questions all creative artists are faced with, sooner or later: \u201cwhat do you do when you have to be creative and it\u2019s just not coming?\u201d\nHis suggestions?\n\u2022 Disengage, wander, and rest;\n\u2022 Work within certain limits and constraints: this puts your brain into problem-solving mode: \u201ctoo big a playing field can muddle the results\u2026 a set of limitations is often the catalyst that sets creativity free.\n\u2022 Exercise, sleep, meditate, be calm.\nStefan Sagmeister is a designer and typographer, known for his unorthodox approach to creativity; his answers demonstrate that what the other articles in this section suggest is right on the spot!\nElizabeth Grace Saunders believes that there are two kinds of creative minds on this planet: perfectionists and pragmatists.\nContrary to what many might say, Saunders doesn\u2019t think that one of these categories is better than the other; she merely advises to choose wisely whose method you\u2019ll use at different stages of the creative process.\nBecause sometimes being perfectionist can get you stuck; other times, however, being a pragmatist can cost you some quality.\nMann, Fowles, Kahlo, Twain, Pop\u2026 none of them was immune to creative blocks; Mark McGuinnes says that this is only natural, since creative blocks are \u201can occupational hazard for creative professionals.\u201d\nSo, the next time you experience a creative block, be aware that you\u2019re in a good company; next, identify which type of a block it is and take a leaf out of these artists\u2019 books:\n\u2022 \n: if your inspiration tank is empty, then take a break \u2013 just like Twain did while writing \n;\n\u2022 \n: John Fowles was embarrassed about the sexual content of his books when he imagined his parents reading them; if you\u2019re feeling this way, give yourself permission to create by saying that you will not make it public; when you\u2019re finished, you\u2019ll decide if you\u2019re going to;\n\u2022 \n: Extrinsic motivations (money and reputation) have a negative impact on creativity; focus on the intrinsic ones (fascination, pleasure);\n\u2022 \n: you don\u2019t have any more personal problems than Frida Kahlo;do what she did: turn them into art;\n\u2022 \n: make a virtue of necessity and achieve as much as you can with what you have;\n\u2022 \n: if you want to succeed, you need to communicate and grow a thicker skin; it\u2019s that simple.\nCoda \u2013 A Call to Action\nends with a Call to Action by novelist Steven Pressfield, the author of quite a few non-fiction books we\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend: \n, \nand \n.\nThe short manifest digests most of the things you\u2019d find in these books and \u2013 naturally \u2013 is inspirational as hell.\nGreat way to end a book on creativity and productivity!\nKey Lessons from \u201cManage Your Day-to-Day\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How to Build a Rock-Solid Routine\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How to Find Focus in a Distracted World\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How to Tame Your Tools (Before They Tame You)\n4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How to Sharpen Your Creative Mind\nHow to Build a Rock-Solid Routine\nEach of the four chapters comprising \nends with a \u201cKey Takeaways\u201d section which briefly sums up the main bits of advice from the respective chapter.\nSo, basically, Glei and 99U did our job for us: thank you, Jocelyn!\nAs far as the process of building a rock-solid routine is concerned, these are the things you should remember:\n\u2022 \nDo your most meaningful creative work at the beginning of your day, and leave \u201creactive work\u201d\u2014like responding to e-mail or other messages\u2014for later.\n\u2022 \nEstablish \u201cassociative triggers\u201d\u2014such as listening to the same music or arranging your desk in a certain way\u2014that tell your mind it\u2019s time to get down to work.\n\u2022 \nCommit to working on your project at consistent intervals\u2014ideally every day\u2014to build creative muscle and momentum over time.\n\u2022 \nMove rhythmically between spending and renewing your energy by working in ninety-minute bursts and then taking a break.\n\u2022 \nMake a point of spending some time alone each day. It\u2019s a way to observe unproductive habits and thought processes, and to calm your mind.\n\u2022 \nShow up, whether you feel inspired or not.\nHow to Find Focus in a Distracted World\nLost your focus amidst the buzzes and the hums of the 21\n century?\nCounterpunch like a boss:\nBook time on your calendar for uninterrupted, focused work\u2014and respect those blocks of time as you would any client meeting.\nTackle the projects that require \u201chard focus\u201d early in your day. Self-control\u2014and our ability to resist distractions\u2014declines as the day goes on.\nTurn off your phone, e-mail, and any apps unrelated to your task. Even the presence of background activity (and temptation) can drain your focus.\nMarking progress is a huge motivator for long-term projects. Make your daily achievements visible by saving iterations, posting milestones, or keeping a daily journal.\nAlternate challenging creative work with more \u201cmindless\u201d tasks to give your brain time to rest and refuel.\nTake a break from checking your smartphone during transitional moments, and open yourself up to opportunity and serendipity.\nHow to Tame Your Tools (Before They Tame You)\nIt\u2019s inevitable: unless you tame your tools, they will probably tame you.\nHere\u2019s what you should do so that you\u2019re always in control:\nPost your complex, long-term goals by your workstation to keep them top of mind when prioritizing your tasks.\nPractice letting go of certain e-mail and social media conversations. There will always be more opportunities than you actually can take on.\nDistinguish between compulsive and conscious behaviors. Are you acting out of boredom or blind habit when you could be serving a higher goal?\nMake a ritual of unplugging on a regular basis. Turning everything off is like hitting the \u201creset\u201d button on your mind\u2014it gives you a fresh start.\nBe conscious of your body. Breathing deeply and regularly can decrease your stress levels and help you make better decisions.\nDon\u2019t trust technology over your own instincts and imagination. Doing busywork is easy; doing your best work is hard.\nHow to Sharpen Your Creative Mind\nNowadays, it\u2019s almost expected from you to be creative all the time.\nIt\u2019s a burden, all right \u2013 but you\u2019ll manage it better if you follow these few suggestions:\nUse personal creative projects to explore new obsessions, skills, or ways of working in a low-pressure environment.\nMake time for your mind\u2014and body\u2014to wander when you\u2019re stuck. Disengaging from the problem allows your subconscious to do its work.\nKeep your inner perfectionist in check by defining what finished looks like at the beginning of a project. And when you get there, stop!\nRepetition is the enemy of insight. Take unorthodox\u2014even wacky\u2014approaches to solving your stickiest problems and see what happens.\nWhen the well runs dry, don\u2019t blame a lack of talent. Creative blocks frequently piggyback on other problems. See if you can identify them.\nLook at constraints as a benefit, rather than an impediment. They activate our creative thinking by upping the ante.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cManage Your Day-to-Day Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nWhen you think about it, \n offers hardly any advice which you\u2019d be inclined to call \u201cnew\u201d or \u201coriginal.\u201d\nHowever, it is difficult to say that it hasn\u2019t gathered the best of the old ones at one place; to make matters better, they are all presented by a different thought leader of our day and age, which kind of gives them even more validity.\nThe effective structure, the clean and minimal design, and the Q&A sessions dispersed through every chapter make \na \u201csmall gem of a book,\u201d one \u201cyou can dip into whenever you need encouragement to get or keep yourself going.\u201d (\n)\nExcellent both as a boost-your-own-productivity toolkit and as a gift for anyone who is on quest to achieve the same."},

And Why?\nHalf a century ago, Simon & Garfunkel sang \u201cSlow down, you move too fast/ You got to make the moment last\u2026\u201d \npresents quite a few clarifications on \n you should do this and strategies on \n to achieve it.\nIt is for everyone who feels that everything\u2019s going just too fast, making life unbearably unenjoyable.\nAbout Richard Carlson and Joseph Bailey\n was an American psychotherapist, motivational speaker, and bestselling author.\nHe published his first book in 1985, but really made his name about a decade later, with the tenth one he penned: \n; the book was a \n\u2019s and \n bestseller for two consecutive years and was translated into no less than 26 languages.\nHis other books include \n.\nCarlson died suddenly from a pulmonary embolism in the 46\n year of his life, after authoring more than twenty books and helping numerous people through his psychotherapeutic practice.\nFind out more at \n \n is an American psychologist and public speaker.\nIn addition to co-authoring this book, he has also authored four others, including \n and \n.\nFind out more at \n. \n\u201cSlowing Down to the Speed of Life PDF Summary\u201d\n\u201cThe feeling of being rushed saturates our entire way of life,\u201d write Richard Carlson and Joseph Bailey in the introduction to \n. \u201cWe measure our success in life by our level of efficiency and our ability to stay on top of it all.\u201d\nIn other words, even though we\u2019ve developed so many \u201ctime savers as computers, fax machines, overnight delivery, voice mail, online services, or high-speed modems,\u201d somehow, we\u2019ve actually created more time stress than we\u2019ve eliminated.\nAs its title suggests, \nis a manual on how to hack this stress-inducing dynamic age of ours using nothing but your mind, focus, and a few tricks and tweaks.\nIts goals are, naturally manifold:\n\u2022 To help you slow down and enjoy each moment through a few minor changes in your lifestyle;\n\u2022 To teach you that, contrary to conventional wisdom, your productivity will actually increase when you slow down to the speed of life;\n\u2022 To demonstrate to you that slowing down to the moment makes the ordinary \u2013 extraordinary, the serious \u2013 trivial, the unexpected \u2013 predictable;\n\u2022 To equip you with a few tools which will make you a more satisfied and happier person.\nBut let\u2019s delve a bit deeper.\nChapter 1: Slowing Down to the Moment\nAt the beginning of their book, Carlson and Bailey assert that there are at least six reasons why it is critical to slow down to the speed of life:\n\u2022 Reduction of stress;\n\u2022 Improved physical health;\n\u2022 More present, intimate, and loving relationships;\n\u2022 Heightened sensory awareness and enjoyment of the natural beauty around us;\n\u2022 Greater peace of mind and serenity;\n\u2022 Dramatically improved ability to be productive and creative and to stay focused.\nAnd you can achieve all of these through the sheer power of thought; but not in that New Age \u201cthink positive\u201d way, but by simply choosing when to harness the power of the right mode of thinking.\nBecause, as you know full well from Daniel Kahneman, \n. \nCarlson and Bailey refer to them as \n and \n.\nWe use the former (which relies on memory) in situations when we know all variables; we use the latter (which relies on insight) when we have to face the unknown.\nMany differences stem from this distinction; the table shows the most obvious ones:\nWhy is this important?\nBecause shifting between these modes of thinking is the foundation of your mental health; and recognizing their inner workings is the first step toward applying them in the right manner, i.e., navigating your thinking.\nChapter 2: Navigating Your Thinking\n\u201cWhen we slow down to the speed of life,\u201d write Carlson and Bailey, \u201cwe tap into a peaceful feeling that permeates our entire being and way of life. Rather than constantly feeling rushed, hurried, and frustrated, we feel calm, joyful, and curious.\u201d\nIn other words, it\u2019s not like bad things don\u2019t happen when we slow down; however, they don\u2019t look as bad as when we\u2019re speeded up.\nA great way to understand this is through the metaphor of the baseball batter:\nIn the processing mode, all problems look like emergencies smothering you, just like a baseball ball traveling at you at 100 mph; however, in the free-flowing mode of thinking, the so-called emergencies look like \u201cissues that need resolving or opportunities in disguise\u201d \u2013 just like a ball slowly moving in your direction.\nCarlson and Bailey believe that you\u2019ll know when to shift between gears if you just listen to your feelings more attentively.\nThey claim that \u201cfeelings are a mechanism to let us know when our minds are operating too quickly and when it\u2019s time to slow down.\u201d\nThey describe them as internal buzzers which go off when we\u2019re thinking in an unhealthy way.\nTheir goal: to help you get back to the moment!\nChapter 3: Getting Back to the Moment\nThe third chapter of \nis all about the four keys to getting back in the moment and the three pitfalls to avoid.\nWe know that your automatic reaction to this is \u201cBut, I listen all the time and it doesn\u2019t help,\u201d but the truth is \u201cno, you\u2019re not listening;\u201d because listening means being present here and now \u2013 and not drifting away every five seconds or so. \nAnd you drift away because you allow your mind to use the wrong thinking mode; so it is helpful to be aware of \n your thinking takes you out of the moment.\nCarlson and Bailey point out two types of thinking which negate listening: \n and \n.\nSo, from now on \u2013 \n listen; don\u2019t interpret or agree/disagree with the one who\u2019s talking.\nWhen you\u2019re immediately interpreting something (or agreeing/disagreeing to something else) you\u2019re actually using the processing power of your brain; however, if the problem is new, then you\u2019re applying the wrong mode because the analytical brain is exclusively memory-based.\nThe solution?\nJust accept that you don\u2019t know what to do from time to time; this will unleash the power of your free-flowing thinking mode and that way you may reach a solution.\nAnd you\u2019ll be calm throughout.\nThis is self-explanatory. \u201cUsing the free-flowing mode of thinking will not turn you into an irresponsible, forgetful person,\u201d write Carlson and Bailey. \u201cOn the contrary, as you slow down you will become less forgetful.\u201d\nThe back burner of your mind works just like the back burner of your stove: you put the ingredients, stir them up, and then \nWhenever you happen upon a difficulty or a quandary on your path \u2013 just do that and, slowly, over time, your brain will come up with a solution. You\u2019ll see.\nPeople speed up their lives in three main ways; start avoiding them if you want to make your life a bit easier:\nThere are times when you are required to analyze your problems, but letting things go and accepting that life is unpredictable is the solution more often than not. \nSo stop trying to force out a solution for every problem: this is your ego trying to predict life; just accept that you don\u2019t know things and this frees up the creative intelligence buried deep inside you.\nThe processing mode is great for \u201cplanning, scheduling, calculating, memorizing, and recalling data;\u201d but it doesn\u2019t work well when you need to face the unknown.\nJudging yourself every time you realize you are out of the moment is not an option; \u201cself-acceptance is the route to slowing down to the moment.\u201d\nMany people are trapped in the past, not realizing that the present is all we have; if you want to be truly happy, you have no other option but to calmly accept \n.\nChapter 4: Stress and Your Innate Mental Health\nA better title for this chapter would have been \u201cSeven Essential Steps for Reducing Stress\u201d because it is, in its entirety, dedicated to an analysis of each of these seven steps.\nWe believe that most of them are pretty easy to understand, so we\u2019ll opt just for a list:\n#1. Knowing that inner peace is possible, even in the midst of stressors;\n#2. Having the humility to admit that \u201cgetting what you want\u201d isn\u2019t the ultimate answer;\n#3. Learning not to deal head-on with or to struggle with problems;\n#4. Understanding that stress originates in your thinking;\n#5. Learning to not allow passing thoughts to turn into thought attacks;\n#6. Avoiding the temptation to get caught up in the details;\n#7. Lowering your tolerance for stress\nChapter 5: Being Present in Relationships\nBeing truly present in relationships is the key to intimacy, satisfaction, and effective, loving communication.\nOr, to phrase that in another way: you can\u2019t expect to have a good relationship if you are not living at the speed of life.\nIn fact \u2013 and think about this \u2013 the very reason why you like some of your friends or partner is that they manage to slow down the time for you.\nThe great news: you can be the one slowing the time in just about every single scenario.\nYou just need to be the inspirer of a heart-to-heart communication, aka follow this set of rules:\n#1. Find your own bearings first; get into the free-flowing mode;\n#2. Let go of any expectations of a particular outcome.\n#3. Get permission from the other person;\n#4. Speak from the heart;\n#5. Listen with nothing on your mind;\n#6. Stay on track; keep the tone respectful, warm, and compassionate.\nOf course, sometimes, reality can be much more unbearable: you may have already lost hope that a relationship can be mended.\nWorry not: Carlson and Bailey provide four guidelines which can help you turn your relationships around: \n#1. Find hope;\n#2. Recognize your thinking;\n#3. See past your habits to the innocence in your partner and in yourself;\n#4. Forgive and forget.\nChapter 6: Peaceful Parenting\nIn the case of many people, there\u2019s also that special form of relationships: parents/children relationships.\nMany agree that we have basically threw them out the window as soon as we embraced computers and smartphones.\nIn this chapter, Carlson and Bailey analyze the problem, by first listing the effects of this form of speed-up parenting, then the benefits of slowing down and finally the strategies for slowing down parenting to the speed of life.\nHere there are:\nSeveral serious consequences follow from busy-minded, speeded-up parenting; here are the most important six among them:\n#1. You become habitually reactive instead of responsive;\n#2. You take negative behavior personally rather than seeing the innocence;\n#3. Little events become front-page news;\n#4. You miss the good times;\n#5. You lose sight of your compassion;\n#6. You expect too much from your children.\nThere are at least seven of these, functioning as sort of antidotes to the detrimental effects of speeded-up parenting:\n#1. Your day-to-day experience will be heightened. Ordinary moments will become quite beautiful.\n#2. You\u2019ll become less reactive and more responsive.\n#3. Your loving feelings and your appreciation for the gift of being a parent will increase;\n#4. You will model peaceful slowed-down behavior;\n#5. You\u2019ll eliminate potential regrets about not having been there for your kids;\n#6. Your wisdom will surface, and you\u2019ll know what actions to take and what decisions to make to raise your kids to their full potential;\n#7. You\u2019ll stop thinking that parenting is so hard.\n\u201cThere are seven proven strategies to slowing down and becoming a more relaxed, effective, and loving parent,\u201d say Carlson and Bailey. \u201cBy implementing each of these strategies in your life, you will take valuable steps toward your goal of slowing down to the speed of life.\u201d\nHere they are:\n#1. Become more oriented to the present moment;\n#2. Learn to accept each moment as it arises;\n#3. Keep your thought attacks to a minimum;\n#4. Practice early thought recognition;\n#5. See moods with compassion;\n#6. Practice doing one thing at a time;\n#7. Live in the free-flowing mode as much as possible.\nChapter 7: Working Smarter\nSlowed-down working is all about a single motto: work smarter, not harder. And working smarter implies listening, reflecting and acting, rather than reacting out of habit:\nIn this chapter, Carlson and Bailey provide a mini-table that should easily illustrate what should be your objective at work: reaching an understanding which will raise you above the middle line.\nVisionary\nDynamic\nSelf-Motivated\n___________________________________________________\nStressed\nSurvival Oriented\nBureaucratic/Dysfunctional\n\u201cThe lower the level of understanding,\u201d they write, \u201cthe more difficult and stressful all the operations of work become \u2013 time management, relationships, decision making, meetings, and deadlines. As the understanding of employees moves above the line\u2026 work becomes more productive, fun, and creative with less energy \u2013 true success.\u201d\nOnce again, the trick is not to get caught up in the whirlwind of deadlines and time-consumers; just like the greatest of sports players do, slow down the pace; and you\u2019ll see things clearer.\nChapter 8: Enjoying Life\nEverything \u2013 every single lesson and advice in this book \u2013 builds up to this: the only life worth living is the one you\u2019ll enjoy in.\nAnd you\u2019ll never smell the roses if you\u2019re racing at 100 mph on the highway.\nLife is the moment you live in; the past is past, and the future hasn\u2019t arrived at. Satisfaction in the present moment is the key to finding some enjoyment in life.\nAnd the key to doing that: prevent your mind from drifting away.\nBecause when it does, boredom, tiredness, and frustrations come: you\u2019re just too much absorbed in a moment (be it a past one or a future one) that isn\u2019t the one you\u2019re living in.\nDo you really want to spend your life that way?\nKey Lessons from \u201cSlowing Down to the Speed of Life\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two Modes of Thinking \n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Slowing Down to the Speed of Life Is All About Navigating Your Thinking\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Four Keys to Getting Back in the Moment\nTwo Modes of Thinking \nThe main premise of \n is that there are two essentially different modes of thinking: the analytical (processing) mode and the creative (free-flowing) mode.\nThe former is based on memory, the latter one on insight; consequently, the former is effortful, linear, habitual, predictable, and works best when all the variables are known; the latter is easy, automatic, spontaneous, and inspired \u2013 and is the one you should use when dealing with the unknown.\nSlowing Down to the Speed of Life Is All About Navigating Your Thinking\nUnfortunately, we are not perfect, so we often inadvertently imprison ourselves within the wrong mode of thinking; this is not much different from using a hammer to polish a windshield \u2013 it will never work, because you\u2019re using the wrong tool.\nAs we said above, you need your analytical thinking if you want to excel at the territory of the known: planning, scheduling, calculating, memorizing, and recalling data.\nHowever, when you face the unpredictable it\u2019s more than wrong to think that you\u2019ll force your way to a solution: the analytical thinking is memory-based and, simply put, even if you can solve the new problem by reusing old knowledge, you\u2019ll certainly find no enjoyment in this.\nThat\u2019s why, as a good rule of thumb, whenever you realize that you\u2019re dealing with a new problem, the best thing to do is just accept that you have no idea how to get out of it.\nThis is the cue which activates your free-flowing mode of thinking \u2013 and that, in general, slows down the world and offers a way out when none appear at the horizon.\nFour Keys to Getting Back in the Moment\nSlowing down to the speed of life is all about living in the moment. \nAnd there are four main strategies to achieve this:\n#1. Listening without interpreting and/or (dis)agreeing;\n#2. Accepting the fact that, more often than not, you \n know;\n#3. Having faith in the free-flowing mode;\n#4. Putting your problems on the back burner and leaving them to cook out a solution for you.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cSlowing Down to the Speed of Life Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nAccording to Dan Millman, the author of \n, \nis \u201ca life-enhancing book with insightful principles for peaceful and productive living at work and at home.\u201d\nEngaging, practical, and easy to understand, \nis even more relevant two decades after its first publication.\nAnd it\u2019s certainly worth a read.\nA slow one."},

And Why?\nThe blurb says it all: \u201cFor readers of \n, \n and \n comes a heart-breaking story of the very best of humanity in the very worst of circumstances.\u201d\nWe\u2019ll add to this list \nas well \u2013 another book you ought to read if you want heartwarming stories coming from the depths of hell.\nHeather Morris Biography\n is a New Zealand-born Melbourne-based Australian author\nAfter getting a job at the Social Work Department at Monash Medical Centre in Melbourne in 1995, Morris decided to follow her passion for storytelling and creative writing and enrolled in The Professional Scriptwriting Course through the Australian College of Journalism.\nHeather\u2019s first screenplay was optioned by Academy Award-winning writer Pamella Wallace (Peter Weir\u2019s \n). \nwas also initially written as a script, but it eventually evolved into a self-published bestselling novel, Morris\u2019 debut.\nFind out more at \n. \nPlot\n, writes Heather Morris in an Author\u2019s note appended to this novel, \u201cis a story of two ordinary people, living in an extraordinary time, deprived not only of their freedom but their dignity, their names, and their identities, and it is Lale\u2019s account of what they needed to do to survive.\u201d\n is the nickname of \n (n\u00e9 \n), an Austro-Hungarian-born Slovak-Australian Holocaust survivor who served as Auschwitz\u2019s main \n\u2013 i.e., tattooist \u2013 for the years between 1942 and 1945.\nAnd when we say tattooist, we don\u2019t mean someone who ornamented the bodies of people with tribals or a favorite quote or two.\nOh no!\nThis is a concentration camp in Nazi Germany, so you already know that Lale was the man responsible for all those numbers inked into the arms and hands of Holocaust survivors.\nHis story is even more remarkable, it turns out.\nYou see, Lale fell in love with one of the girls he had tattooed, \n.\nShe\u2019s the second person of Morris\u2019 concise summary of her novel.\nBut for many months of Lale\u2019s life, she was nothing more than a number:\n34902.\nLale and 34902\n opens in the Auschwitz concentration camp in June 1942, where we can witness a young man named Lale tattooing a young girl, a newcomer, with the number 34902.\nLale tries not to look at her all the while, and she, warned to say nothing, tries not to utter a single shriek, regardless of all the blood and pain.\n\u201cWell done,\u201d he says to her once he completes his job.\nAnd then, this happens:\nThe story shifts back a few months, and we learn that, in the month of April 1942, Lale was in the girl\u2019s position himself: soon after his arrival to Auschwitz, he was tattooed with the number of 32407. \n\u201cHow can someone do this to another human being?\u201d \u2013 Lale wonders. \nBut it is only the beginning of his suffering.\nSoon enough, he becomes ill from typhus, and it is only to the kindness of his bunkmates that he owes his survival.\nAfter his recovery, Lale becomes an apprentice to \n, the tattooist of the camp. In the following two months, the two inscribe countless arms with unique ID numbers.\nIn June 1942, an all-female group arrives to the camp; one of the prisoners catches the eye of Lale; he tattooes her with the number 34902.\n\u201cHurry up, Lale,\u201d Pepan urges him.\nWhen Lale looks up again, the girl is gone.\nHead T\u00e4towierer\nTime passes, and one day Pepan mysteriously disappears.\nBut this is a place where you are not advised to use words such as \n and \n in situations such as these; the only thing you do is accept the fact and everything that comes with it.\nIn Lale\u2019s case, the direct consequence is that he becomes the head T\u00e4towierer of Auschwitz, a position which, naturally, comes with a few privileges; among them, the most important are knowing the date (we\u2019re not joking!), extra rations and better lodgings.\nIt also comes with a bit of a setback: a personal guard.\nHis name is \n \n, a crude and violent man born in Romania, but also one whose not-so-very-pleasant past (to use a euphemism) can explain a lot about his behavior; though uneducated and brutal, Baretski is also humane enough to notice the way Lale looks at one brown-eyed girl one Sunday afternoon.\n\u201cWould you like to meet her?\u201d \u2013 he asks the head tattooist. \u201cWrite to her, tell her you like her,\u201d Baretski says to Lale\u2019s surprise. \u201cI\u2019ll get you paper and a pencil and bring her your letter. What do you say? Do you know her name?\u201d\nWell, if you can say a number is a name, then you do too: it\u2019s 34902.\nFortunately, Baretski is serious and, with his help, Lale finally meets the girl. \nHe learns that her name is Gita, but nothing more: she\u2019s simply not interested in sharing details about her past, for the simple reason that she doesn\u2019t believe in her future.\nHowever, the thing growing inside their hearts is just too powerful to be resisted.\nAnd \n almost anything.\nA Network of Smugglers\nLale uses his privileged position to make Gita\u2019s life a little more bearable in the camp: through Baretski, he sends her not only messages but also extra food for her and her close ones.\nIn addition, Lale creates a network of smugglers whose goal is quite about the same, but whose subject is broader.\nThis is how it works?\nFirst, the girls who sort through the confiscated goods of the newly arrived prisoners bring him jewels and money and everything even remotely worthy.\nThen, Lale uses the jewels to pay laborers from the nearby villages.\nNext, these villagers sneak in food and medicine inside Auschwitz, which Lale either distributes to the ones in need or uses them to bribe other people in privileged positions such as him.\nIt\u2019s little, but, in the end, it\u2019s the most one can do at a place which was basically \n.\nWe, for once, can\u2019t imagine a hell more frightening than the one walled within the concentration camps of Second World War Poland.\nThe Gypsies and Doctor Mengele\nAfter some time, a large group of Romani people arrive at the camp and are lodged in Lale\u2019s block.\nA good place as any for a digression: people seem to forget that up to 1 million Romani were killed during the Holocaust!\nEven more: what was Holocaust to one group of people, was actually Porajmos for another; in case you didn\u2019t know, that\u2019s the Romani word for \u201cDevouring,\u201d and the way the Romani refer to what we only know (unjustly) as the Holocaust.\nAnyway, Lale is fascinated by the Romani way of life \u2013 who isn\u2019t? \u2013 and he starts spending more and more time with them; after a while, he becomes an honorary Romani, and the block itself is lightened up by the new guests so much so that it becomes known as the \u201cGypsy camp.\u201d\nBut, wait a second!\nWe\u2019re in Auschwitz.\nOf course, happiness and warmness are not things you usually feel here.\nEnter Doctor Josef Mengele.\nIf you don\u2019t know him \u2013 but you probably do from your nightmares \u2013 he was a member of a team of doctors who selected victims to be killed in the gas chambers.\nIn his case, however, the rest were the \n fortunate, because they eventually became part of his pretty deadly medical experiments.\nYup, he was a real-life doctor Frankenstein; even worse: he used living and breathing people to conduct his experiments.\nTemporarily Losing the Privileges\nOne day, the SS guards reveal jewels and food under Lale\u2019s mattress.\nOnce again, this is Nazi Germany, so we don\u2019t need to tell you what follows: Lale is stripped of his privileges, tossed into an interrogation cell, and beaten senseless.\nFortunately, he is not executed \u2013 thanks to his connections and the bribes mentioned above. However, after he is released from prison, Lale is made laborer for a while before his old job is given back to him once again.\nTwo years have passed since his imprisonment:\nLale can\u2019t wait to go back to the Gypsy camp.\nThe only problem?\nThere\u2019s no such thing anymore, because, in the meantime, most of its members \u2013 in a way, Lale\u2019s extended family \u2013 had been murdered.\nThinking about Mengele, we have to add: others might not have been as fortunate.\nThe Separation\nHalf a year later, rumors of an uprising start circulating around Auschwitz, coupled with the news of the imminent arrival of the Soviet army.\nThe SS officers are dedicated to destroying the records and start transferring the prisoners.\nAmong the those transferred is Gita who Lale sees being marched out of the gates of the camp with hundreds of other female prisoners.\n\u201cGita!\u201d he screams, kneeling in the snow in front of an unmoving guard.\n\u201cHe looks up at the sky, which seems only to be getting darker as the morning breaks. Above the noise of screaming guards and barking dogs, he hears her: \u2018Furman. My name is Gita Furman!\u2019\u201d\nThere\u2019s still time for Lale to shout out loud three more words: \u201cI love you.\u201d\nBratislava\nUnbeknownst to Lale, Gita manages to escape from the guards and together with some other women, she finds refuge in a nearby village.\nAfter some time, she reaches Bratislava, where she joins many other Holocaust survivors: in 1945, Bratislava was the main point for Holocaust survivors in Czechoslovakia. \nTwo days before the liberation of Auschwitz, Lale is transferred himself to another place, the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. \nHe manages to escape, but only to be captured by the Russians, who use Lale\u2019s knowledge of quite a few languages to force him to find them lovely young ladies interested in spending some time with them.\nAfter several weeks, Lale gains their trust and uses this to escape from the Russians as well.\nFinally, he makes his way to Bratislava, but even after weeks of searching, he isn\u2019t able to find anyone by the name of Gita Fuhrmann.\nAnd then, one day, Gita and two of her friends pass by a funny-looking cart drawn by a tired old horse.\nA young man climbs down from it.\n\u201cIs it him?\u201d says one of Gita\u2019s friends.\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Gita. \u201cIt is him.\u201d\nLale is unable to move; Gita walks to Lale and kneels in front of him: \u201cIn case you didn\u2019t hear me when we left Birkenau, I love you,\u201d she says.\n\u201cWill you marry me,\u201d he replies.\nDo we really need to tell you the answer?\nThe Tattooist of Auschwitz Epilogue\nAnd that\u2019s how the novel ends.\nBut there\u2019s an epilogue\nto\nwritten in the author\u2019s more objective tone. Together with the \u201cAdditional information\u201d section, this part gives a brief overview of what happened next to the real Lale and Gita. \nWe learn that Lale and Gita chose the surname Sokolov because unlike Lale\u2019s birth surname Eisenberg, this one sounded far more Slavic.\nLale founded a business dealing with the import of fine fabrics, the last in Bratislava to be nationalized by the communist government.\nSubsequently, he was sent to prison, where (advised by a Catholic priest) he started acting mad so that he could see a psychiatrist with whose help he got leave from prison.\nDuring these days, Lale and Gita managed to escape to Vienna, from where the couple emigrated to Australia and settled in Melbourne.\nThe two had a child named Gary, the author of the poignant \u201cAfterword\u201d to Morris\u2019 book.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Tattooist of Auschwitz PDF Summary Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\n, \ntakes quite a few liberties with the facts, containing multiple errors, exaggerations, misinterpretations, and understatements.\nSo be careful when you read it; however,\n read it, because it\u2019s such an exceptional story of love and survival.\nOne that will surely inspire you to research some more about Lale Sokolov."},

Even though with no marketing, no publicity, and no promotion, word of mouth made the book a tremendous hit and by early 2012, Manson was earning enough to make a living as an author.\nSo, he quit coaching and focused solely on his writing; after substantially revising \nfor three different editions, in 2016, Manson published \n, his second book, and yet another bestseller. \nshould come out next year; we eagerly await.\nFind out more at \n. \n\u201cModels PDF Summary\u201d\nJust like \n is Mark Manson\u2019s no-nonsense reaction to the impracticability and deceitfulness of the self-help publishing industry, \nis his scathing attack on the dishonesty and deceptiveness of the pick-up artist community and its core values and ideas. \nSelf-described as \u201cthe most mature and honest guide on how a man can attract women without faking behavior, without lying and without emulating others,\u201d \nis not a book of tricks or shortcuts.\nIt is a book which strives to teach you how to become everything that your innate attractiveness potential promises that you can be and, thus, become a catch for the women recognizing it.\nPart I: Reality\nOne of the first rules of attractiveness according to Mark Manson is this: \nAnd if you need a definition of neediness, it is \u201cwhen a man places a higher priority on others\u2019 perceptions of him than his perception of himself.\u201d\nIn practice, this means that you are needy if you alter your feelings, thoughts, and motivations (aka \n) relation to the women you want to get.\nAs a rule of thumb, \u201cyou should not be willing to sacrifice your thoughts, feelings, and motivations for someone else more than they sacrifice theirs for you.\u201d\nIt\u2019s basic evolution, in the end: women were forced by the gritty reality of the past hundred thousand years to choose the men who control their destiny, the men unfazed by the threats posed to them.\nIf you were a woman, after all, who would you choose: the man described above, or the one who can\u2019t stand up for himself and whose emotions are dictated by those around him?\nYeah, we too.\nMost people today associate vulnerability with weakness, despite the fact that \n.\nAnd that is especially true in the case of men!\nHowever, Mark Manson subverts this narrative: the more vulnerable you\u2019re willing to be, the more powerful you can become, he says.\nThink of it this way:\nAll the things that matter \u2013 whether banal such as saying a joke which may not be funny or serious such as expressing an unpopular opinion you feel to be true \u2013 require you to stick your neck out on the line emotionally in some way.\nIn other words, you\u2019re making yourself vulnerable when you do these things.\nNeedless to add, you\u2019re making yourself even more vulnerable when you\u2019re telling a woman you like her and want to date her.\nNow, you can listen to all those PUAs and act all aloof when you do that; in the short-term, it may work, and you may get the girl.\nBut bear in mind: you didn\u2019t even get off to a good start with her!\nThat was not you at the very beginning since you chose to suppress your emotions so as not to be hurt; however, in the long run, that means that you will never be able to build a healthy relationship with this girl.\nThe foundations are all wrong.\nTo become more vulnerable, you need to become more attuned to your emotions and more accepting of the fact that you might get hurt quite a few times.\nHowever, with time, you\u2019ll not only develop the right attitude but also grow into a healthy individual in touch with his own feelings and emotions.\nWin-win.\nNow, the whole idea behind the very existence of PUAs presupposes that dating is nothing short of a game which \n be rigged \u2013 if you know how.\nMark Manson thinks otherwise: as you know full well from experience, you\u2019re never the only one who knows how to bend the rules.\nIn other words, if you\u2019re cheating during a game and winning, then you\u2019re either probably playing with someone that\u2019s (for better or worse) not in your league (no, that\u2019s not a compliment if you follow!) or, quite probably, you\u2019re about to be cheated yourself out of success in a more profound manner.\nNeil Strauss\u2019 second book \u2013 coincidentally titled \nand published four years after \n\u2013 proved Manson right.\nThe point?\nIf you\u2019re in it for the sex and you\u2019re comfortable with turning your love life into an endless series of meaningless one-night stands, then you need nothing but the PUA community to guide you.\nHowever, if you\u2019re planning on finding a woman, you\u2019ll be able to talk to and sleep next to, then how on earth is a lie going to get you there?\nIn time, vulnerable men mature enough to be able to accept one of the most uncomfortable truths of life: namely, that \u201cwith most of the women you meet, things are simply not going to work no matter what you do or say.\u201d\nBut that\u2019s fine, notes Manson:\nPart II: Strategy\nFull honesty, writes Mark Manson, is polarizing.\nBut to understand that sentence you need first to know that there are three categories of women: Unreceptive, Neutral, and Receptive.\nWomen who are Unreceptive are \u201cunavailable and/or uninterested in having a sexual/romantic relationship with you.\u201d\nNeutral women are those who don\u2019t offer or reciprocate themselves, while not necessarily turning down your offers.\nFinally, Receptive women who are sexually/romantically attracted to you.\nNow back to the first sentence of this chapter summary.\nTrue honesty, according to Mark Manson, transforms Neutral women and makes them either Unreceptive or Receptive.\nRegardless of what anyone would tell you \u2013 especially PUAs \u2013 \n are good. \u201cRejection exists for a reason,\u201d writes Manson, \u201cit\u2019s a means to keep people apart who are not good for each other.\u201d\nIn other words, if you lie your way through the receptiveness of a neutral woman, you\u2019ll just be wasting your time, because, well, it\u2019s not you that she\u2019s attracted to.\nIf you\u2019re honest, it\u2019s a win-win: even if you\u2019re rejected, you\u2019ll know that it\u2019s because the real you is incompatible with the real her:\n\u201cI see every rejection simply as some form of incompatibility,\u201d writes Manson in the fifth chapter of \n, once again highlighting one of the main ideas of the book:\nIndeed, it is when you think about that: life is too short to spend it with the wrong people. \nIn more ways than one, you should be more than happy that there exist such things as rejections!\nThe Three Fundamentals of Attraction \u2013 i.e., \u201cthe three ways in which a man can become more vulnerable and become less needy\u201d \u2013 are the following:\n\u2022 \n: Creating an attractive and enriching lifestyle.\n\u2022 \n: Overcoming your fears and anxiety around socializing, intimacy and sexuality.\n\u2022 \n: Mastering the expression of your emotions and communicating fluidly.\nManson spends the rest of the book to explore each of these in detail.\nPart III: Honest Living\nFirst of all, says Mark Manson, let\u2019s get one thing straight: \u201cage, money, and looks matter \u2014 in some cases a lot, in other cases, not a lot, but they still matter. And anyone who tells you that they don\u2019t matter is lying.\u201d\nBut secondly, neither of them matters nearly as much as most men think.\nFirst of all, age. \nStudies have shown that while women\u2019s attractiveness peaks at 21, men\u2019s physical attractiveness peaks a decade later, at 31; moreover, the average 45-year-old is still considered as physically attractive as the average 18-year-old!\nIn other words: men, consider yourself more than happy! Fortunately for you, women usually judge a man\u2019s status on style, grooming and how he presents himself; so, thanks to the fact that women are less shallow than men, you have much more time than the gentler sex.\nMoving on to money.\nOnce again, it\u2019s important because it reveals one\u2019s status; so, its importance gradually increases with age; also, money is an important factor in the mind of many women who have spent their childhoods in poverty.\nAs for looks: interestingly enough, it tends to be valued most by women who \ngood looks.\nAnd this is the general truth: \u201cwomen who only care about things such as looks and money,\u201d writes Manson, \u201care usually going to be women who you\u2019re not going to be interested in or who are not going to make you happy.\u201d\nWhy?\nBecause they have no other interests.\nSo, you\u2019re not missing out on much.\nAs we implied above, women and men judge attractiveness differently.\nMen judge female beauty by physical traits first, personality and presentation second; most women, on the other hand, prefer personality and presentation to physical attractiveness.\nThat\u2019s why Mark Manson dedicates the entirety of Chapter 8 to sharing a few important pieces of advice on how to present yourself.\nThe topics this chapter covers are quite a few and the suggestions for each just too many and too straightforward for us to be able to summarize them in brief.\nWe\u2019ll give you a list of the former so that you know where to look if you need a specific type of advice:\n\u2022 Fashion and fitness\n\u2022 Body language\n\u2022 Vocal tonality\n\u2022 Developing character\n\u2022 Bringing it all together\nPart IV: Honest Action\nAs \n and \n discovered about a century ago, in a way, we are the stories we tell ourselves.\nAnd as numerous psychologists have demonstrated in the meantime, these stories usually share one defining characteristic: they exist to protect the status quo, to safeguard our emotional inertia.\nPut more simply: they are our defense mechanisms, the way our \n helps us to cope with disappointments and rejections.\nThis, naturally, comes with a price: we constantly change, and we don\u2019t know it.\nThe good part?\nWe have the power to change these stories and open ourselves to being more vulnerable and, thus, more attractive.\nThe stories we tell ourselves \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m too good for this girl,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been with prettier ones\u201d \u2013 should essentially help us overcome our anxiety.\nHowever, the needier we are, the less this succeeds: anxiety, according to Manson, stems from our unwillingness to open up to the world and be vulnerable.\nManson\u2019s main suggestion on how to overcome your anxiety is not really that different from the suggestion you\u2019ll hear from every single psychotherapist with at least some basic education.\nNamely, do not run away from your fear: embrace it.\nBecause, no matter what anyone tells you, you \n escape from it; you can only integrate it within your existence.\nPart V: Honest Communication\nAny honest communication begins with honest intentions. \n\u201cYour ability to connect with a woman emotionally,\u201d writes Manson, \u201cis proportional to how self-aware you are of your own emotional processes and motivations.\u201d\nUltimately, self-awareness and vulnerability are the things women want most in men \u2013 especially if the men are a bit rugged at the beginning\nThat\u2019s the archetype \n: the Beauty and the Beast, \u201cthe taming of the wild man by the desirable and virginal woman.\u201d\nPeterson mentions \nas an example, but Manson goes a step further: all romance novels, he says, share the exact same pattern.\n\u201cThis is more or less the blueprint of seduction,\u201d he goes on, \u201cstrong, high status, attractive exterior (lifestyle and looks), fearless, and able to open up and share your vulnerable side with her.\u201d\nApparently, \u201cwomen get weak in the knees\u201d for this.\nAnd you can achieve it in three steps:\n\u2022 Become aware of your emotions and motivations;\n\u2022 Take the lead and be the first one who\u2019ll share them;\n\u2022 May your stories become more and more personal over time.\nShe\u2019ll share her stories with you in no time.\nAnd that\u2019s emotional connection at its best.\nThe best part?\nIt\u2019s honest!\nBy his own admission, this chapter grants a whole book in itself, so Manson merely glosses over the most important aspects of flirting here.\nHe points out \u2013 yet again \u2013 that first impressions matter and that startling or scaring someone upon approach is \u201cthe only death knell for approaching women.\u201d\nHe then advises men to use effective language and statements instead of questions, in addition to revealing how to spin out endless conversation topics out of anything a woman might say.\nFinally, he moves on to storytelling, the basics of emotional connection, and caps his discussion on flirting with \u2013 what else? \u2013 a few pieces of advice on good vs. bad humor.\n\u201cLike it or not,\u201d writes Manson in the first paragraph of this chapter, the dating process follows a somewhat rigid line.\u201d\nIn particular: \u201cboy meets girl, asks girl on date, corresponds with girl, sets up date with girl, corresponds with girl, sets up second date with girl, repeat until eventually you bring girl home with you, and at some point you decide if you\u2019re exclusive, non-exclusive, a casual couple, fuck buddies, soul-mates, or never want to see each other ever again.\u201d\nManson covers all of the stages here, but mostly focuses on the process of exchanging phone numbers and the strategies for a perfect date.\nAs far as the latter is concerned, he advises a lot of \n activities and changing venues. So, basically, not unlike \n.\nThat you should be the one organizing it all and making all the moves is a given.\nThis book was always going to end with a discussion about sex, wasn\u2019t it?\nWe won\u2019t go too deep into this one topic \u2013 pun unintended \u2013 but suffice to say that Manson remains consistent throughout his whole book with regards to his core principles, and this chapter is no exception.\nSo, don\u2019t be afraid to go for it: if you\u2019re wrong in your analysis of her signals, you\u2019ll be rejected which is (once again!) much better than thinking \u201cwhat could have been.\u201d\nAlso: be confident and generous, but, above all, be dominant:\nHere are Manson\u2019s four suggestions on how to become dominant in bed:\n\u2022 Be loud. Make noise. Grunt. Breathe hard.\n\u2022 Talk dirty, even if it is outside your comfort zone.\n\u2022 Get physical, picking her up and moving her yourself.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t ever ask \u201cIs this OK? Do you want to do X?\u201d That\u2019s a big turn off.\nKey Lessons from \u201cModels\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Be Vulnerable, But Never Needy\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Truth Polarizes \u2013 So Be Honest\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Three Fundamentals of Attractiveness\nBe Vulnerable, But Never Needy\n\u201cA man\u2019s attractiveness is inversely proportional to how needy he is\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s the first rule in Mark Manson\u2019s dating advice book.\nIn other words, if you want to be attractive, don\u2019t act needy. \nBe vulnerable instead.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean acting weak; it merely means putting your neck out there, exposing yourself and your true emotions and risking to be hurt.\nBecause that\u2019s how you grow and develop into an attractive mature man.\nTruth Polarizes \u2013 So Be Honest\nThere are three types of women: unreceptive, neutral, and receptive.\nThe former are the ones who won\u2019t return your advances, while the latter the ones who do; the middle ones are those who neither accept them nor turn you down.\nWhen you\u2019re honest about your feelings, you are polarizing the woman you share them with.\nIn other words, you\u2019re either making her unreceptive or receptive.\nEither way, it is great, since rejection exists for a reason. It\u2019s nature\u2019s way of telling you that you\u2019re incompatible with someone.\nAnd life is too short to spend it on people you\u2019re incompatible with.\nThe Three Fundamentals of Attractiveness\nThe Three Fundamentals of Attraction are \u201cthe three ways in which a man can become more vulnerable and become less needy.\u201d\nThese are:\n\u2022 \n: Creating an attractive and enriching lifestyle.\n\u2022 \n: Overcoming your fears and anxiety around socializing, intimacy and sexuality.\n\u2022 \n: Mastering the expression of your emotions and communicating fluidly.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cModels Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nAs we said in the Introduction, Manson\u2019s \nis far more honest and far less misogynistic than most of the dating advice books targeted at men and written during the past two decades.\nHowever, it still resorts to quite a few dubious evolutionary explanations, and it still pictures women as subconsciously submissive beings who can\u2019t rise above their innate desire to mate with a civilized beast. And that\u2019s neither fair nor true.Even so, Manson\u2019s \n, with its insistence on vulnerability and truthfulness, should certainly help many men become more attractive, and many women \u2013 less disappointed in men.\n\n"},

And you already know that he didn\u2019t have a happy childhood.\nThe neighborhood he\u2019s talking about is Williamsville, Buffalo, New York; the year is 1981 and Goggins is merely 6 years old; and hell is a corner lot on Paradise Road.\nWhy?\nBecause even though on Paradise Road everyone lives \u201cnear the top of the food chain,\u201d and even though most of their neighbors believe that the Goggins family is \u201cthe tip of that spear,\u201d under the surface, nothing is as beautiful as it seems.\n\u201cIf Paradise Road was Hell,\u201d notes Goggins ominously, \u201cthat meant I lived with the Devil himself.\u201d\nThe Devil\u2019s name: Trunnis Goggins, a self-made businessman and longtime owner of Skateland, a roller-disco rink; also: David\u2019s father. Kind of a big deal in Williamsville: so much so that you can find his \n in \n; however,\nyou won\u2019t read in it what really matters.\nAnd that is that Trunnis was a tyrannical father; built like a boxer, he tolerated no disobedience, no matter how unreasonable his demands had been.\nOne of these demands was that his 17 years younger wife Jackie and his children \u2013 David and Trunnis II \u2013 work for him tirelessly at the rink, every night until midnight; of course, this resulted in David regularly falling asleep in school the following day.\nBut it gets worse.\nYou see, Trunnis ran a prostitute ring; his pop-up brothel was the summer cottage of the president of one of Buffalo\u2019s biggest banks; hence, the loans and the credits.\nAnd the worst part?\nDavid often witnessed Trunnis beating Jackie senseless with his leather belt, hitting her, dragging her by the hair; when David tried to help her, he beat him too.\nThe Things You Can\u2019t Escape\nIn 1983, when David was 8 years old, Jackie had it just about enough: with the help of a sympathetic neighbor, she took David with her and hurriedly left Trunnis\u2019 house, planning never to come back again.\nTrunnis II didn\u2019t want to live: despite Trunnis\u2019 cruelty, he decided to stay with his father; fortunately, it seems that, despite the hardships, \n (we had to do a bit of research).\nAnyway, Jackie and David moved to the small town of Brazil, Indiana, where they suddenly had to adapt to an entirely different life.\nUp until recently, they had lived in a rich neighborhood and could afford just about anything; and because of his father\u2019s, ahem, connections, it didn\u2019t even matter that they were black.\nSuddenly, that had to live in a public housing block and get through the month on Jackie\u2019s part-time job and a measly monthly welfare check.\nTo make matters worse, David started feeling the full power of his past\u2019s demons; he started suffering from toxic stress, getting a stutter overnight, losing both his hair and his skin pigment: \nCoping with the Bitter Reality of Life\nAnother thing that toxic stress causes: memory loss. \nAnd not the good kind, as in \u201cI\u2019ll forget the bad things of my past to make room for the future and move on;\u201d oh no \u2013 we\u2019re talking about the bad kind, as in \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of learning the alphabet and remembering all these historical facts when someone could beat me up this very instant?\u201d\nIn other words, David had serious problems finding his way around school, once even overhearing Ms. D., his teacher, telling Jackie that David belonged in a different school, one for \u201cspecial students.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t help that he was the only black kid in his class and that \u201cSouthern Indiana had always been a hotbed of racists.\u201d\nIn 1991, David (still struggling with literacy, almost unbeknownst to anyone, because he was constantly cheating) opened up his Spanish class workbook to find, scribbled inside it, an image of him in a noose and below it the words: \u201cNiger, we\u2019re gonna kill you.\u201d\nAnd it didn\u2019t stop there.\nBy the end of that year \u2013 David was almost 17 \u2013 his grandfather bought him a used, brown Chevy Citation. One of the first mornings he ever drove it to school, someone spray painted the word \u201cnigger\u201d \u2013 this time spelling it correctly \u2013 on his driver\u2019s side door.\nDavid started living in \u201ca haze of hate, trapped in [his] fruitless rage and ignorance,\u201d \n and living in isolation of his community.\n\u201cBy my junior year,\u201d David writes, \u201cI went out of my way to piss people off by becoming the exact stereotype racist white people loathed and feared.\u201d\nYou know what he means: pants down, wild \u2018dos, car stereo wired to house speakers.\nAir Force Training \n\u201cEverything I did was to get a reaction out of the people who hated me most because everyone\u2019s opinion of me mattered to me, and that\u2019s a shallow way to live,\u201d writes Goggins.\n\u201cI was full of pain, had no real purpose, and if you were watching from afar, it would have looked like I\u2019d given up on any chance of success. That I was heading for disaster. But I hadn\u2019t let go of all hope. I had one more dream left: I wanted to join the Air Force.\u201d\nDavid\u2019s grandfather had been a proud cook in Air Force for 37 years, and Goggins was inspired by him to join the Civil Air Patrol, the civilian auxiliary of the Air Force.\nThere, he became fascinated with Pararescue \u2013 \u201cthe guys who jump out of airplanes to pull downed pilots out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d\nAnd for a while, everything was going great: at 6\u20192\u201d and 175 pounds, David was \u201ca star recruit\u201d and was well-liked by his drill sergeant.\nHow could that not be?\nHe \u201cwas one of the best at push-ups, and the best at sit-ups, flutter kicks, and running.\u201d But something he hadn\u2019t expected was coming his way: water confidence.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a nice name,\u201d says Goggins, \u201cfor a course where they try to drown your ass for weeks, and I was uncomfortable as hell in the water.\u201d\nSo, what did David do?\nWhat most of us would: he quit, one point behind honor grad.\nFast forward a few years, and David was but a shadow of himself, weighing almost twice as much as when in Air Force training, burying his shame at the kitchen table while being stuck in a night-shift pest exterminator job.\nWhat a fall from grace!\nJoining the Navy SEALs\nAnd then, one day, while showering, David heard \u201ca narrator\u2019s voice filter through the steam\u201d and coming from the TV. He caught a few snippets: \u201c\n.\u201d\nHe rushed back to the living room and sat transfixed for at least 30 minutes. \u201cThe show,\u201d informs us Goggins, \u201cfollowed Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL (BUD/S) Training Class 224 through \n: the most arduous series of tasks in the most physically demanding training in the military.\u201d\nThis \u2013 this was what he had always wanted to do:\nWith a new-found motivation, Goggins spent the next few weeks calling everybody, pleading for an opportunity to become a SEAL.\nHe finally found a suitable program, one for former military recruits.\nThe good news?\nIt was about to start in three months.\nThe bad news?\nGoggins weighed 300 pounds at the time, and the maximum weight allowed was 191 pounds.\nYou know the ending of the story already, so no need to beat around the bush: Goggins made it! And he made through the training as well, finally achieving his dream of joining the Navy SEALs.\nUltra-Running\nDavid Goggins, however, is rarely described as a Navy SEAL.\nThe first sentence of his \n, for example, looks (at the moment of writing) something like this: \u201cDavid Goggins (born February 17, 1975) is an American ultramarathon runner, ultra-distance cyclist, triathlete, motivational speaker and author.\u201d\nIn other words, Goggins is much more famous for his superhuman capabilities as an ultrarunner; and he began his career in ultramarathon running merely as a way to contribute to a good cause.\nNamely, when several of his fellow Navy SEALs were killed in Afghanistan in 2005, he attempted to raise awareness by entering the Badwater-135 Ultramarathon.\nHowever, he was told by organizers that it is an invitation-only event, so Goggins had to run at least one other ultramarathon first.\nDavid entered the San Diego One Day 24-hour ultramarathon and was able to run the 100 miles in under 19 hours, despite the lack of preparation and the fact that he hadn\u2019t run such an event ever before.\nBadwater-135 was next.\nYou need to know something about that race: it not only describes itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s toughest foot race,\u201d but it quite probably is nothing less.\nTo finish it, you\u2019d need to run 135 miles in the Badwater Basin in California\u2019s Death Valley, starting at 279 below sea level (85 m) and ending at 8360 feet above it (2548 m).\nAnd oh \u2013 it\u2019s happening in July, when the temperatures can reach 130 \u00b0F (above 50 \u00b0C)!\nDavid Goggins completed Badwater-135 in 30 hours, finishing in fifth place, an unheard-of achievement for a novice at an event very few people are capable of even finishing!\nOnce again: Goggins weighed 300 pounds at 24; it\u2019s never too late.\nKey Lessons from \u201cCan\u2019t Hurt Me\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0David Goggins\u2019 Childhood Was a Nightmare\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quitting Is Easy \u2013 Even for Champions\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the Right Mindset and a Lot of Hard Work, You Can Do It Too\nDavid Goggins\u2019 Childhood Was a Nightmare\nDavid Goggins spent his childhood in Williamsville, working night shifts on his father\u2019s roller-disco rink; and as if that wasn\u2019t enough, his father was a violent man \u2013 and a pimp \u2013 who\u2019d beat him and his mother for every single form of disobedience.\nFortunately, when David was merely 8 years old, his mother escaped to the small town of Brazil, Indiana, taking David with her. \nLife still sucked, though: David was suffering from the consequences of toxic stress, and, as the only black kid at his school, he was often the victim of racist bullying, \nQuitting Is Easy \u2013 Even for Champions\nDavid tried finding a way out in Air Force training, dreaming of becoming a Pararescue.\nUnfortunately, even though everything was going great for a while, David was supposed to complete his training by gaining some water confidence, i.e., completing a course during which they try to drown you for weeks; and he wasn\u2019t that good at swimming or comfortable under water.\nSo, he quit, using a routine medical check-up (which showed that he has a predisposition to sickle cell anemia) as an excuse to do so.\nThe point?\nIt\u2019s always easy to find an excuse, even if you\u2019re a champion; but, as they say, if you want to succeed, instead of excuses, you\u2019ll find ways.\nWith the Right Mindset and a Lot of Hard Work, You Can Do It Too\nDavid Goggins found them: he\u2019s now considered one of the fittest men on this planet.\nHow did he do it?\nWith the right mindset and a lot of hard work.\n, David Goggins writes quite straightforwardly: \nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cCan\u2019t Hurt Me Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\n\u201cDavid Goggins is a being of pure will and inspiration,\u201d says Joe Rogan. \u201cJust listening to this guy talk makes you want to run up a mountain. \nAnd he goes on: \u201cI firmly believe people like him can change the course of the world just by inspiring us to push harder and dig deeper in everything we do.

At some stage, they\u2019re going to need to say, \u2018OK the blueprint is now good, we\u2019ve got all the necessary approvals to build so let\u2019s get started.\u2019\u201d\nTactics without strategy leads to \u201cbright shiny object syndrome.\u201d\nDib\u2019s perfect analogy?\n\u201cImagine you started building a wall without any plans and then later found out that it was in the wrong place, so you start pouring the foundation, and then you find out it\u2019s not right for this type of house, so you start excavating the area where you want the pool, but that isn\u2019t right either. This clearly isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d\nThe problem?\nThis is exactly how many business owners do marketing: \u201cThey string together a bunch of random tactics in the hope that what they\u2019re doing will lead to a customer. They whack up a website without much thought, and it ends up being an online version of their brochure, or they start promoting on social media because they heard that\u2019s the latest thing and so on.\u201d\nThe solution?\nConsider the 1-Page Marketing Plan your way out of a pickle such as the one described above; it is a manual on how to build the right marketing strategy so you can start putting it into practice.\nThe 1-Page Marketing Plan consists of three major phases, each of which consists of three minor parts. Dib\u2019s book is a thorough, step-by-step guide through each of these stages, leaving no stones unturned and no questions unanswered.\nSo you can find your way around the book better, here\u2019s a blank template of the 1-Page Marketing Plan. By the end of the summary, you\u2019ll understand what each of these squares means and how you should fill it before doing anything in terms of marketing.\nAct I: The \u201cBefore\u201d Phase\nThe \u201cbefore\u201d phase is all about prospects:\nOne of the main mistakes most businesses make is targeting everyone; of course, this eventually backfires and results in no customer conversions.\nNot to mention in a loss of a lot of money as well.\nThe trick is to market your products to a niche.\nFirst of all, because as humans we value specialists much more than jack-of-all-trades; the latter is pejorative for a reason.\nSecondly, being a big player in a small niche is much better than being a small player in a the great outdoors; to quote our favorite \u201cmisquoter\u201d Michael Scott: instead of being a little fish in a big pond, be the top dog in a fairly large pond; the dog is the real boss.\nOf course, merely saying that you should market to a niche isn\u2019t enough; you need to choose the right niche for you.\nTo do this, Allan Dib proposes Dr. Frank Kern\u2019s \n (Kern is an attorney at law and chief engineer with NASA) which allows you to give each market segment you serve a rating between 1 and 10 and decide according to the final score.\nPVP stands for:\n: How much do you enjoy dealing with this type of customer? \n: How much does this market segment value your work? Are they willing to pay you a lot of $$$ for your work?\n: How profitable is the work you do for this market segment? Remember it\u2019s not about the \u201cturnover,\u201d it\u2019s all about the \u201cleft over.\u201d\nAnother great tool for getting into the mind of your prospects is becoming one of them temporarily.\nYes, we\u2019re talking about creating avatars, \u201cthe marketing equivalent of method acting.\u201d\nWith method acting you win Oscars; with avatars \u2013 customers.\nMost advertising is \u2013 according to Dib \u2013 \u201cboring, similar and useless.\u201d In the end, it all comes down to a simple formula: company name + company logo + a laundry list of services offered + claims of best quality, best service or best prices + offer of a \u201cfree quote\u201d + contact details.\nIf you want to stand out from the crowd, this is not the way to go!\nIt\u2019s time you start marketing the way people play chess: purposefully, with a very concrete beforehand strategy in mind. \nDib\u2019s rule of thumb is one ad, one objective; you have to be clear on the purpose of your ad and only then make it.\nIt\u2019s wrong to try to sell through the ad: the ad should only intrigue and invite the customers to find out more; nobody would buy something from someone who sells something in general terms and through a boring ad.\nSpeaking of \u2013 quality and service are too abstract and too expected to be part of your ad; you need to have a \n; this is how you stand out.\nInclude in your ad an elevator pitch: people don\u2019t buy products but solutions to problems; it is the latter you need to pinpoint in your ad; target the prospect\u2019s pain and focus on the benefits of your products.\nPeople are much more willing to pay for the cure than for prevention, so targeting existing pain results in much higher conversion than promising a bright future.\nChoose a relevant name for your product; think of it this way: if you need to explain it, then you\u2019ve made the wrong choice.\nWhat gets measured \u2013 gets managed. \nUnfortunately, \u201cthe reality is that most small businesses do little if any tracking of advertising. Not measuring where your leads and sales come from and not tracking ROI on ad spend is the mark of the amateur.\u201d\nROI, of course, stands for return on investment. Not knowing the numbers that matter \u2013 customer lifetime value and acquisition cost \u2013 means not knowing whether you\u2019re losing or earning money through your advertising campaign.\nNeither Dib nor we have to tell you that we live in the 21\n century and that \n. \nHowever, don\u2019t think of social media as a selling environment; think of it as a way to create and manage customer relationships and turn them into something more for you, aka financial benefit.\nOf course, that means that whether on Facebook or on Twitter, whether through emails or SMS, you need to act as a friend to these people and not as a marketing rep.\nBe conversational, engaging, give valuable information.\nAlso, complement email with snail mail; it may sound regressive, but it works \u2013 especially if it\u2019s what makes you different from your competition.\nHow would you feel if you receive a postcard from a business? Wouldn\u2019t you be a bit more connected to it on an emotional level, even if merely subconsciously?\nAct II: The \u201cDuring\u201d Phase\nIf the \u201cbefore\u201d phase was about prospects, the \u201cduring\u201d phase is about leads:\nAs we said above, selling directly from your ad is wrong, dead wrong! And this is because \u201cthe vast majority will not be ready to make a purchasing decision on the very day they read your ad\u2014even if they are interested in what you do.\u201d\nWhy?\nBecause the market for your product or service usually looks like this:\nIf you\u2019re selling through your ad you\u2019re basically targeting only the 3% who are ready to buy immediately, and you\u2019re missing out on at least 37% of your audience!\nAnd you can go from 3% to 40% \u2013 increasing the effectiveness of your advertising by 1,233% \u2013 through an \n.\nAn ethical bribe is something free which helps you generate leads; if someone takes it, then he\u2019s identifying himself as one of the 37% your sell-immediately ad won\u2019t reach out to.\nDon\u2019t be a hunter, says Allan Dib, because that means you\u2019re in a constant battle to be successful: if you don\u2019t kill something today, there won\u2019t be a lunch for your family.\nBe a farmer: plant the seeds, water them, and tend to your crop; then \u2013 start harvesting!\nApparently, half of the salespeople give up after one contact, 65% give up after two and four-fifths give up after three shots.\nHowever, farmers don\u2019t work like that: they water their seeds over and over again until they either produce or die.\nThat\u2019s what nurturing leads boils down to: evolving from a pest to a welcome guest by being persistent. Becoming a factor in the lead\u2019s mind requires at least five contacts; after the ninth, you have a 90% chance of being called:\n\u201cSales conversion,\u201d writes Allan Dib, \u201cis all about creating enough trust and demonstrating enough value to motivate interested leads to become paying customers.\u201d\nOf course, this starts with positioning. If a boxer is too eager to attack, he will probably lose the match; if you\u2019re too eager to sell, you\u2019ll lose the trust of the customer.\nBuild the trust by delaying the sale and providing your customer with valuable information throughout; this will position you as someone of value in his/her mind.\nAnother thing that should help you is understanding the common fears of your customers; if you can address them before the sale, then you have a very tangible \n.\nAlso: never give your prospects and leads too many options; this results in paralysis by analysis and lack of a final decision.\nGiving your leads only two or three options and pricing is the best way to go; especially if you can combine this with a \u201ctry before buy\u201d sample.\nAct III: The \u201cAfter\u201d Phase\nFinally, the \u201cafter\u201d phase is all about \n:\nGood businesses have customers; great businesses have raving fans.\nBuilding \n requires commitment and awareness that the final goal is not to convert a prospect into a customer; but a customer into a raving fan.\nTo do so, you need to: \n\u2022 Continually focus on wowing your customers;\n\u2022 Attempt to create and foster lifetime relationships;\n\u2022 Make it easy and fun to deal with you;\n\u2022 Create a sense of theatre around your products and services (remember Apple\u2019s 1984 ad?);\n\u2022 Build systems which will guarantee that you\u2019ll reliably and consistently deliver a great experience.\nRemember \n?\nThe main point of that story is that, if you\u2019re looking for a treasure, it\u2019s probably best to start looking for it in your own backyard.\nThat\u2019s Dib\u2019s marketing advice as well: \u201cMost businesses have a rich \u2018diamond mine\u2019 in the form of existing customers which remains largely untapped, yet they leave this \u2018family\u2019 of existing customers after the first few transactions and spend all their marketing energy, money, and resources on seeking new sources of revenue.\u201d\nThis is wrong!\nBecause your existing customers will accept almost anything from you if you turn them into raving fans.\nFor example, do you know that \u201cWould you like fries with that?\u201d is responsible for hundreds of millions of McDonald\u2019s dollars on a yearly basis?\nWhy?\nBecause of what Cialdini calls in \n \u201cthe contrast principle,\u201d aka upselling. If you\u2019re buying a suit, then two more shirts seem comparatively cheaper, and you\u2019d have no problem buying them as well; it\u2019s difficult the other way around.\nUse the logic of upselling to your benefit; raise your prices and make your products more exclusive; even better, move your existing customers to your higher priced products and services (ascension).\nIncreasing the frequency with which your customers buy from you through reminders, vouchers, or subscriptions is another way to go.\nFinally, you should never underestimate a reactivating campaign: your past customers can also be your future raving fans if you play your cards right.\nRelying on \u201cword for mouth\u201d referrals is not that dissimilar from hoping for a free lunch to feed your family; Allan Dib is adamant: systems create great businesses.\nAnd when it comes to referrals, there are a few things you should have in mind.\nThe most important one?\nPeople refer a company to other people not because they want to help the company but because they want to help their friends or loved ones.\nThat\u2019s why a good strategy to get a referral is if you offer an existing customer a gift or a voucher for his/her friends or family.\nAsking for a referral before delivering a result is like asking for a kiss the first second of a blind date: it makes you look bad.\nHowever, asking a referral after delivering the goods may even make your customer feel closer to you; sometimes this works even better than offering a percent for a referral; the latter is a business transaction, but the former a friendly engagement.\nAnd marketing is about your customers\u2019 emotions; even if it sometimes means toying with them.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe 1-Page Marketing Plan\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \u201cBefore\u201d Phase: Dealing with Prospects\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \u201cDuring\u201d Phase: Dealing with Leads\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \u201cAfter\u201d Phase: Dealing with Customers\nThe \u201cBefore\u201d Phase: Dealing with Prospects\nThe 1-Page Marketing Plan consists of three phases.\nThe \u201cbefore\u201d phase is the one in which you\u2019re dealing with prospects, people that may not even know that you exist.\nIn this phase, your job is to select your target market (always a niche), craft your message (never unoriginal) and deliver this message through the advertising media (don\u2019t sell through your ad!)\nThe goal is to make yourself familiar to your prospects and inspire them to respond to your message; once they do this, they\u2019ve become leads, and you\u2019re ready for Phase #2.\nThe \u201cDuring\u201d Phase: Dealing with Leads\nThe second phase, aka the \u201cduring\u201d phase, is all about the leads \u2013 the people who have indicated some kind of interest in the products and/or services you offer.\nTo capture them, you need to ethically bribe them and nurture them with regular value-building information; only after delaying the sale, you\u2019ll be ready to make it.\nAnd that is the goal of this phase: turning your leads into customers.\nThe \u201cAfter\u201d Phase: Dealing with Customers\nOf course, that is not the end of your marketing journey: now you need to turn these customers into raving fans, get their money, and inspire them to refer you to other people.\nYou do this by delivering a world-class experience and turning yourself into a tribe leader capable of increasing customer lifetime value and orchestrating and stimulating referrals.\nThis, finally, results in an ongoing \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d which is the way a good business becomes a great one.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe 1-Page Marketing Plan Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\n\u2013 as its title suggests \u2013 is as simple as marketing books go: perfectly structured, free-flowingly written, blatantly honest and pleasantly (if sometimes too pop-artsily for its own sake) illustrated.\nYou\u2019ll find faults with it only if you hate money; we guess that you\u2019re didn\u2019t choose a career in marketing because you do."},
{"title": "The Prosperity Bible PDF Summary", "url": "https://blog.12min.com/the-prosperity-bible-pdf-summary/", "cover": "https://blog.12min.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image2-6-685x1024.jpg", "content": "8 min read \u231a\u00a0\nIt was hard to summarize a book that literally abounds with insights, quotes, strategies, and knowledge.\nAs the name implies, you\u2019ll get introduced to the greatest writings and secrets of the wealthiest and how you can get there.\nThis book or let\u2019s say a collection of insights is a blessing in disguise for those of you who want to reach new heights and explore new depths.\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s dig in.\nWho Should Read \u201cThe Prosperity Bible\u201d? And Why?\nDespite the fact that we believe this \u201c\n\u201d has all the hallmarks of a great broad-range classic \u2013 it\u2019s suited only for those who are fed up with the mediocre life.\nIf you lust for more influence and prosperity, then this definitely should be your go-to guide.\nAbout Napoleon Hill\n is well-known around the world and hailed for his discoveries and inquiries in the realm of self-help and personal development.\nRegarded as the founding father of this 20\n-century self-help philosophy, he excelled as an author and entrepreneur in some sense.\nIt\u2019s also critical to mention the books he wrote, which brought about a revolution in the world: \n\u201cThe Prosperity Bible PDF Summary\u201d\nThe science behind getting rich has been on everyone\u2019s lips since the beginning of time.\nBefore we go any further, it\u2019s vital to point out that there is nothing wrong in wanting to improve your financial status. Some people get castigated for being too ambitious, but the craving for a more abundant, flamboyant lifestyle is by all means, admirable.\nAs an addition to that, one can clearly see that life is nothing but a battleground for the mind, soul, and body. You must address their needs, in order to create this perfect synergy or circle in which none is better than the other.\nWhen it comes to the formula, there are some laws which if followed could facilitate the transition from rags to riches.\nFunny thing about rich people is that upon diving into the subject, Napoleon discovered that they are just about as casual as you are. This literally stigmatizes the popular opinion that rich people are gifted and have to do very little to accrue wealth.\nIt all requires more than a steady stream of income or assets \u2013 but that\u2019s a story for another day.\nFor a person to get to a position of power and prosperity, it must acknowledge the fact that the real battle unfolds from within. Creation or intuitiveness is by all accounts an essential asset in building this inner aura.\nIf the principles you espouse and deem legit provide you with enough room to exhibit your talents, then you are on the right path.\nIf you like to take the fast-track to success, Napoleon advises you to undergo a shift in perception.\nSo, here how it works.\nEvery time a stream of thoughts pops up telling you are not worth it, you need to neglect them and focus on a positive outcome. In all honesty, this is no picnic, and it\u2019s regarded as an uphill battle by every stretch of the imagination.\nTo counter this, the universal energy or thought radiates an unconfined sense of creativity, which if embraced fully could shore up your business and activities.\nIf you lean on the Universal law, bad thoughts will not become a distant memory, but they will lose their grip. \nRemember that life is from within outward, not vice versa, which means you\u2019re the wielder of power.\nThere\u2019s one rule that Napoleon believes to be noteworthy and it goes like this:\nIf by some stretch of the imagination you decide to bring more value to people on the receiving end, and cash-in later \u2013 you\u2019ll be much more pleased with the results. In other words, if you have people working for you; it\u2019s imperative for you to absorb more in cash value than you actually pay them in wages.\nLast but not least, let\u2019s unpack the much-talked-about phenomenon \u2013 Formless Substance. \nAs the name vaguely implies, it\u2019s a downright process, that rarely happens in front of your eyes.\nIt\u2019s designed to absorb the creativity that permeates the environment and adjusts according to time and circumstances. \nSome companies and organizations, find it very challenging to excel under the umbrella of the Formless Intelligence. \nAnd it\u2019s even harder to conduct this process in a harmonious manner. \nTo make sure that the rope is not overly stretched, one must go through some basic ground rules.\nBefore we dive into that, let\u2019s just say that all of it can be summed up in one word \u2013 gratitude.\nIt\u2019s needless to say that the more grateful you feel, that more likely it is for you to find the harmonious undertone.\nWhen it comes to getting rich, it is a must for you to get into the right frame of mind.\nEveryone has desires, so pulling that off will not suffice.\nIn the magnetic field of energies, one must take hold of the needle of the compass and direct it towards a goal-specific mental plan.\nNow, let\u2019s go back and find out a bit more about the harmonious way of dealing with things:\nLessons that lead-up prosperity\n \u2013 \nIf you look up and down, you\u2019ll find that the divine mind is the absolute truth. When a person is courageous enough to embrace that kind of ideas into its mind, an incredible force emerges and strengthens your position in the world.\n \u2013 \nIt\u2019s clear as day, that there\u2019s no such thing as an impossible endeavor, in the providence of God. To put it simply, desire is the living reflection of the Universal impulse. \n \u2013 \nOver the course of thousands of years, people have developed faith and trust towards the unseen that cannot be grasped through the senses. \nIt\u2019s a state of mind, that prompts us to envision a much brighter outcome, than the one presented before us.\nApart from the lessons, there are other instances where prosperity is and should be scrutinized.\nFirst off, you have to accept the relative reality, and then you are given the go-ahead to do the drilling.\nYour judgment is predicated upon your view of the world and your surroundings. Therefore, it\u2019s impossible to ascertain which side is more realistic, because our mind determines our reality.\nIf your mindset is predominantly tilted towards optimism, you\u2019ll do much better in life.\nThat\u2019s not rocket science and has been proven over and over again.\nEven the secret of success revolves around optimism, and mindset above all else.\nThe truth is \u2013 with so many active discussions going on regarding success, it\u2019s difficult to separate the actionable from the inaccurate.\nTruthfully, only a small number of people are eligible to give advice \u2013 Napoleon is one of them. Practically, only the people who put the accent on individuality and reject the collective blame could eventually flourish in the market of ideas.\nBear in mind that the mere nurturing of dormant and latent Individuality makes it harder to express oneself or exhibit positive behavior. \nOn top of that, when our lucrative careers are on the line, people find it hard to lead the flock and rise to the occasion.\nAs you can see, the formula around prosperity always revolves or leans on a person\u2019s competence. \nAnd sustaining and advocating for free expression on behalf of the individual is what lies at the end of the battle.\nBasically, this is the primary ingredient that enables success and prompts productive discourse.\nIt\u2019s no wonder why society glorifies people in all walks of life who have achieved extraordinary results in their sphere of knowledge. However, as people, we tend to live by the excuse that these brilliant individuals had a flair while we weren\u2019t born that lucky.\nAs a response to the misleading reality, Napoleon Hill takes sides with those whose Interest and Desires are manifested in action. \nEnthusiasm is also among the things that usually predicts success in the workplace.\nIf you add time to all of these elements, you pretty much get the accurate picture on how to achieve success and prosperity.\nIf we take the whole human history and existence into consideration, it\u2019s pretty obvious that the ultimate goal is growth and evolution. Life is dynamic in every shape and form, and one cannot put it in a static mode, even at will.\nStagnation is the ultimate sin and a paradox that cannot be accomplished, ever.\nEven if you decide not to do anything, growth and development will still take place.\nWhen it comes to prosperity, the feeling or the impetus for acquiring knowledge is the reason behind every action. Knowing that in order to earn respect, you have to undertake certain types of activities is both liberating and frightening to those who might get the short end of the stick.\nIn this case, resorting to pressure and fear will do you no good.\nThe mere notion of rejecting personal responsibility for your actions is by all accounts the worst-case scenario.\nWith that in mind, one must bring its ingenuity into line with the know-how acquired during a certain period of time, in order to overcome the hurdles down the way.

And Why?\nAs suggested by the title, \nis for everyone who wants to master the art of rhetoric.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are looking for a piece of advice for an impromptu speech during a friend\u2019s gathering or ways to nail that wedding toast \u2013 Dale Carnegie has it all packed and neatly structured in about 200 pages.\nAnd he sees no reason why you shouldn\u2019t become the next \n or \n and know \n and when to say it.\nAbout Dale Carnegie\n was an American lecturer and bestselling author, one of the pioneers in the fields of self-improvement, corporate training, and public speaking guidance.\nA poor farmer\u2019s son, Dale Carnegie dreamt of becoming a lecturer ever since his childhood years, but after finding a little success as an actor in the years before the First World War, he went nearly broke.\nIt was then that he got an idea to teach a course on public speaking which was a success and resulted in the publication of \nin 1926.\nHis crowning achievement came a decade later when Simon & Schuster published \n, one of the all-time self-improvement classics; something similar can be said about \n, first published in 1948.\n\u201cThe Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking PDF Summary\u201d\nFirst published in 1962, \nis often marketed as the fourth revision of \nDale Carnegie\u2019s famous 1926 textbook which went through more than fifty printings in the next three decades and was translated into no less than 11 languages.\nHowever, this fourth revision is different than the previous three in at least two ways:\n\u2022 First and foremost \u2013 and most obvious in view of the fact that Dale Carnegie died in 1955, \u2013 this revision wasn\u2019t made by him: instead, it was made by his wife Dorothy, based on her husband\u2019s notes and ideas;\n\u2022 And secondly, it is such a substantial revision that it is difficult to consider it as merely a version of \n; it\u2019s nothing less than a completely different book. \nAnd will be treated as such.\nDivided into five parts and fourteen chapters, the book is both an introduction to public speaking and a manual for mastering it.\nThough its examples may be a bit outdated, they are delivered in an easy-to-read language and reveal a theoretical framework for the ages.\nPart One: Fundamentals of Effective Speaking\nIn the chapters that make up the first part of this book, Dale and Dorothy Carnegie \u201cdiscuss the basic principles of effective speaking and the attitudes to make these principles come alive.\u201d\n\u201cIn order to get the most out of this book,\u201d writes Dale Carnegie in the Introduction to the first chapter of the first part of his book, \u201cand to get it with rapidity and dispatch, you will find these four guideposts useful:\u201d \nAs you have heard it quite a few times just from us, \n and, even if it isn\u2019t, \n \n\u201cThere is no such animal, in or out of captivity, as a born public speaker,\u201d writes Carnegie straightforwardly right off the bat.\nIn other words \u2013 as is the case with every single sphere of human endeavor \u2013 you can learn to become a public speaker; quite probably, in much, much less than 10,000 hours (\n).\nThe reason why there were periods of time when there were many more public speakers than today is, simply put, because public speaking was considered important and was part of the curriculum. \nNothing more, nothing less.\nAccording to Dale Carnegie, \n, Harvard\u2019s most distinguished professor of psychology, said it best when he said:\nCarnegie describes these six sentences as \u201cthe open sesame to Ali Baba\u2019s treasure cave of courage.\u201d \n\u201cLife\u2019s battles don\u2019t always go to the stronger or faster man,\u201d wrote poet Walter D. Wintle a century ago, \u201cbut sooner or later the man who wins is the man who thinks he can.\u201d\nThat\u2019s Dale Carnegie\u2019s third guidepost for success: predetermine your mind to it.\nHow?\nTake a lesson from Caesar and burn your ships after crossing Dover; now, with the last means of retreat burned, you\u2019d have no choice but to conquer England.\nOK, that title is pretty self-explanatory.\nOvercoming stage fright and developing confidence is not that difficult and you shouldn\u2019t consider it an insurmountable obstacle to your success as a public speaker; you just need a few weeks of practice.\nAnd these four pieces of advice.\nNever forget these four facts about public speaking:\n\u2022 You are not unique in your fear of speaking in public;\n\u2022 A certain amount of stage fright is useful: it is nature\u2019s way of preparing us to meet unusual challenges in our environment;\n\u2022 Many professional speakers never completely lose all stage fright;\n\u2022 The chief cause of your fear of public speaking is simply that you are unaccustomed to speak in public.\nDaniel Webster said once that he\u2019d sooner appear before an audience half-clothed than half-prepared; and Lincoln mused that he should never be old enough to speak without embarrassment when he has nothing to say.\nIn other words: only the prepared ones can be confident.\nAnd they can do this by:\n\u2022 Never memorizing a talk word for word;\n\u2022 Assembling and arranging their \n beforehand; and\n\u2022 Rehearsing their talk with their friends.\nA piece of repeated advice, but, then again, a justly repeated one.\nJust follow these simple rules to do so:\n\u2022 Lose yourself in your subject;\n\u2022 Keep your attention off negative stimuli that may upset you;\n\u2022 Give yourself a pep talk.\nYour adaptive unconscious can\u2019t really make the difference between actual and mimicked feelings and actions.\nIn other words: \n.\nThese are the three cardinal rules for a quick and easy way to learn to speak in public:\nThis is the rule you\u2019ll hear repeated most often as Lesson #1 from this book. \nTell your listeners what life has taught you and be sure to look for topics in your background.\nThat\u2019s the best way to conquer your fears and earn confidence.\nOf course, not everything you \n talk about is something you \ntalk about. And great public speakers deliver their speeches with passion and fervor. So, be excited about your topic.\nPart Two: Speech, Speaker, and Audience\nThis part discusses the speech triangle: speech/speaker/audience.\n\u201cThere are four ways to develop speech material that guarantees audience attention,\u201d writes Dale Carnegie. \u201cIf you follow these four steps in your preparation you will be well on the way to commanding the eager attention of your listeners.\u201d\n\u201cYou must limit and select before you begin, narrow your subject down to an area that will fit the time at your disposal.\u201d\nFollow this simple rule-of-thumb:\n\u2022 In a short talk \u2013 around 5 minutes \u2013 you have time to go over one or two points;\n\u2022 In a longer talk \u2013 between 5 and 30 minutes \u2013 you have time to go over four or five main ideas.\nAfter narrowing your subject, now it\u2019s time to ask yourself some difficult questions about it and get about ten or a hundred times as much information as what you\u2019d actually use in the end.\nThis is what Dale Carnegie refers to as \u201creserve power.\u201d\nDo this by following these five rules:\n\u2022 Humanize your talk;\n\u2022 Personalize your talk by using names;\n\u2022 Be specific \u2013 feel your talk with details;\n\u2022 Dramatize your talk by using dialogue;\n\u2022 Visualize by demonstrating what you are talking about.\nWe do not think in generals \u2013 but in particulars; take a lesson from Shakespeare, and instead of saying \u201csuperfluous,\u201d say something like \u201cto gild refined gold, to paint the lily, to throw perfume on the violet.\u201d\nAnd that comes from\n, one of his worst plays.\n\u201cIf a speaker believes a thing earnestly enough and says it earnestly enough,\u201d Carnegie says, \u201che will get adherents to his cause, even though he claims he can produce bluegrass from dust and ashes.\u201d\nYou know why you watch movies? \nBecause they allow you to satisfy your need for emotional expressiveness.\nOffer that to your audience.\nActing in earnest will make you feel earnest. Remember that.\nSpeaking of feelings and your relationship with the audience \u2013 here are a few rules that will help you to build up \u201ca strong feeling of rapport with your listeners:\u201d\nVisualize your audience as eager to hear what you have to say; otherwise, you\u2019ll think that you\u2019re boring your audience and you\u2019ll find your listeners restless and hopefully looking to the exit doors.\nThis helps nobody.\nDon\u2019t tell your audience that is the most intelligent you have ever addressed or that you love each and every one of them; be exactly one hundred percent sincere with them. Hollow flattery may work in the short-term, but in the long-term \u2013 gets you nowhere.\nOnce again, self-explanatory: say \u201cwe\u201d when you start feeling that the \u201cyou\u201d creates a space between you and the audience.\nAsk questions, be \n, use a little showmanship!\n\u201cAn audience is quick in taking the measure of a speaker who assumes that he is superior in mental accomplishment or in social standing,\u201d writes Carnegie. \u201cIndeed, one of the best ways for a speaker to endear himself to an audience is to play himself down.\u201d\nPart Three: The Purpose of Prepared and Impromptu Talks\nIn part three, the Carnegies develop in detail two methods of delivering a talk: the extemporaneous (aka prepared) one and the impromptu method.\nThe impromptu method aside, you need to know that every talk, regardless of whether the speaker realizes it or not, has one of four major goals:\n\u2022 To persuade or get action;\n\u2022 To inform;\n\u2022 To impress and convince; or\n\u2022 To entertain.\nThe following chapters analyze each \u2013 but the entertaining one \u2013 of these goal-oriented talks in detail.\nIf you want to persuade or get action through your speech, be short and straight to the point.\nAlso:\n\u2022 Build your example upon a single personal experience;\n\u2022 Start your talk with a detail of your example;\n\u2022 Fill your example with relevant detail;\n\u2022 Relive your experience as you relate it.\n\u2022 Make the point brief and specific;\n\u2022 Make the point easy for listeners to do;\n\u2022 State the point with force and conviction.\n\u2022 Be sure the reason is relevant to the example\n\u2022 Be sure to stress one reason\u2014and one only\nIf you want to be merely informative in your talk, then you should always have in \n: \u201cEverything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly. Everything that can be said can be said clearly.\u201d\nAlso, you should follow these rules:\nThis is always important \u2013 but \n if you want to be informative.\nSee below: this works great when you enumerate.\nFirst of all, because one can follow much better if you enumerate for him your points.\nSecondly, because he/she will remember better if you follow this strategy.\nThirdly \u2013 and lastly \u2013 because it always works.\nTo do this:\n\u2022 Turn a fact into a picture; and\n\u2022 Avoid technical terms\n.\nGetting a favorable reaction is every speaker\u2019s objective at any time, anywhere. However, sometimes, this is the main goal.\nIf that\u2019s what you want to achieve, these five advices by Carnegie should be more then helpful.\nAccording to the ancients, the orator was nothing less than \u201ca good man skilled in speaking.\u201d And when it\u2019s your purpose to convince someone, then you better try to say something that you believe in. \nYou must be sincerely convinced in what you\u2019ll attempt to convince others; otherwise, you probably won\u2019t.\nDon\u2019t argue with your audience: even in arguments, there\u2019s always some common ground. Start from there.\nReason alone hasn\u2019t convinced anyone ever; you must deeply believe in what you say, and you must express it in a way that will demonstrate this belief. Reason wins minds; contagious enthusiasm wins hearts. The latter works better, smoother, and faster.\nBut \u2013 be sincere while doing this; neither underestimate nor overestimate them.\nLet\u2019s face it: so many things depend on the first impression; that\u2019s why it\u2019s essential that you begin in a friendly way.\nSomeone \u2013 a jazz-musician, we think \u2013 once said that he spends a lot more time preparing for his improvisations than for anything else. \nHave that in mind if you are interested in giving impromptu talks: they don\u2019t come by themselves.\nTo be able to give the impromptu speech when it really matters, prepare yourself by giving impromptu speeches when it doesn\u2019t; nothing comes out of nothing, wrote Shakespeare; he might as well had practicing in mind when he wrote that.\nYou must be mentally ready to speak impromptu; don\u2019t start an impromptu speech if you feel fear even in the tiniest amount; it doesn\u2019t work that way.\nThere are three reasons why you should do this:\n\u2022 It is freeing;\n\u2022 It will get you into \u201cthe swing of speaking;\u201d\n\u2022 You will enlist the attention of your audience at once.\nTo quote Carnegie, \u201cthrow yourself with abandon into your talk, and you will help to insure your success as an impromptu speaker.\u201d\nThere are three sources from which you can get ideas for an impromptu speech:\n\u2022 \n; talk about them and use an example they should know;\n\u2022 \n; there\u2019s a need for an impromptu speech when there are more than just a few guys around; surely you can talk about how that happened, right?\n\u2022 \n; be an attentive listener and link your speech to something someone has said before you.\nThat\u2019s a nice way to point out the difference between merely talking about something and giving a talk; the former is formless; the latter has structure; jot it in your mind before starting the speech.\nPart Four: The Art of Communicating\nPart four is dedicated in its entirety to the subject of delivery, and it contains merely one short chapter.\n\u201cThere are four ways \u2013 and only four ways \u2013 in which we have contact with the world,\u201d says Carnegie at the beginning of this chapter. \u201cWe are evaluated and classified by these four contacts: what we do, how we look, what we say, and how we say it.\u201d \nThis chapter deals with the last of these \u2013 \u201chow we say\u201d things; you\u2019ll say them better if you follow these five rules:\n#1. Crash through your shell of self-consciousness\n#2. Don\u2019t try to imitate others \u2013 be yourself\n#3. Converse with your audience\n#4. Put your heart into your speaking\n#5. Practice making your voice strong and flexible \nPart Five: The Challenge of Effective Speaking\nThe final part of \nrelates the principles and techniques already laid out in the previous four parts to everyday speaking, from social conversations to a formal public address.\nCarnegie has these five suggestions to help you make a well-organized speech of introduction:\nJust taking a little time to prepare should save you the embarrassment of saying something that will nowadays go viral. (\n.)\nUse the T-I-S Formula as a handy guide. It\u2019s an acronym:\n\u2022 \n; \u201cstart your introduction by giving the exact title of the speaker\u2019s talk;\u201d\n\u2022 \n \n; \u201cin this step bridge over the area between the topic and the particular interests of the group;\u201d\n\u2022 \n; \u201chere you list the speaker\u2019s outstanding qualifications, particularly those that relate to his topic. Finally, you give his name, distinctly and clearly.\u201d\nHow would you like to be presented? Enthusiastically, of course. Well, be enthusiastic when presenting another one.\nThat\u2019s a given.\nThis goes for all the presenters out there; but we guess all of them already know this.\nAs you know full well because of the music at the Academy Awards, the acceptance speech should be even shorter than the speech of presentation. And, whatever you do \u2013 don\u2019t exaggerate. Even if he exists, God probably has more important stuff on his mind, so no need to thank him, ha?\nIt\u2019s insane to start building a house without some sort of a plan; it\u2019s just as ridiculous to start delivering a longer talk without a vague notion of what you want to accomplish.\nAnd just like in the case of house-building, there are time-tested methods for each phase of organization when it comes to longer talks:\nHow?\nThis is the way:\n\u2022 Begin your talk with an incident\u2014example arouse suspense\n\u2022 State an arresting fact\n\u2022 Ask for a show of hands\n\u2022 Promise to tell the audience how they can get something they want\n\u2022 Use an exhibit\nContrary to popular opinion:\n\u2022 Do not open with an apology;\n\u2022 Avoid the \u201cfunny\u201d story opening;\nHere are four ways you can do that:\n\u2022 Use statistics;\n\u2022 Use the testimony of experts;\n\u2022 Use analogies; and/or\n\u2022 Use a demonstration with or without an exhibit.\nThis is how all of your speeches should end:\n\u2022 Summarize\n\u2022 Ask for Action\nThe fourteenth chapter of \nadvises its readers to start applying what they have learned from this book to everyday conversations, so they become masters when it really matters.\nHere are the five techniques to do this:\n#1. Use specific detail in everyday conversation\n#2. Use effective speaking techniques in your job\n#3. Seek opportunities to speak in public\n#4. You must persist\n#5.

Kannan\u2019s essay demonstrates something that should be obvious to anyone but the hardcore capitalists: the trickle-down effect may work for the higher castes, but the lower your position on the caste pyramid, the less sense it makes to believe that free markets will make any difference in your life.\nDrawing on Kannan\u2019s work on the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector, the essay offers a statistical framework which proves, once again, that \neconomy \u2013 or free market fundamentalism as some would say \u2013 rather than obliterating inequality \n it.\nAnd before you start screaming from the top of your lungs \u201chey, you, communists, you, but that\u2019s \n, after all,\u201d please take a minute or two to digest this fact: 92% of Indian workers do not have secure forms of employment!\nWhy?\nBecause owners, hungry for docile workforce, try their best to keep the status quo, ensnaring the poorest in linguistically isolated communists and denying them access to welfare government schemes anyway they can.\nThat\u2019s the capitalist miracle of India for you, right there! \n3. \u201cTea Belts of the Western Ghats, Kerala\u201d \u2013 Jayaseelan Raj\nJayaseelan Raj\u2019s essay analyses the working conditions in the tea belts of Kerala, where for decades the main workforce consists of Tamil Dalits, \u201cdescendants of indentured workers initially transferred by the British to work on tea plantations.\u201d\nHowever, their condition hasn\u2019t improved but deteriorated after India \n, because contemporary plantation owners have used the chaotic transition toward free-market capitalism to prevent the Tamil Dalits from accessing any personal land, including, say, kitchen gardens cultivated by them for their personal use.\nThis \u201cinculcates a sense of psychological alienation in which workers control nothing in the plantation\u201d \u2013 not even their own lives.\nSo why don\u2019t they unionize, you ask?\nWell, they\u2019ve tried, but to no avail!\nBecause Adivasis are living in even worse conditions and every attempt at unionization is thwarted by threats that the Tamil Dalits will lose their jobs to Adivasi workers from Jharkhand.\nBack at the time of the \n, the Dalits and the Adivasis could be used as a hypercorrect definition \n more than a century later, it seems that nothing\u2019s changed. \n4. \u201cCuddalore, Chemical Industrial Estate, Tamil Nadu\u201d \u2013 Brendan Donegan\nBrendan Donegan\u2019s essay, \u201cCuddalore, Chemical Industrial Estate, Tamil Nadu\u201d analyzes how the shift from an agrarian to industrial economy has merely reconfigured the ever-existent caste-based dependencies \u2013 and nothing more.\nIndustrialization, shows Donegan, hasn\u2019t resulted in an outward migration of people but has merely caused in-migration of industry.\nIn other words, it\u2019s not that new factories are built in more progressive Indian cities allowing Dalits and Adivasis to break free from their untouchable status by moving somewhere else; it\u2019s that former plantation owners have now built factories in the vicinity of the plantations.\nVanniyars and Gounders were the upper-caste landlords before the industrialization, and they are now factory owners and labor contractors; the Paraiyar (Dalits), the Irula (Adivasis), and the Nattar (fishers) were the underprivileged lower-caste workers in the agricultural past \u2013 and they still are.\nOnce again, their unionization is held in check by migrant contract workers (from Odisha and Bengal), and, once again, they are pressured into obedience through many hardly legal measures.\nHere\u2019s an example analyzed and commented upon by Donegan.\nA Dalit breaks away from his lower-caste shackles and becomes a labor contractor; in time, he succeeds to agree 6 contracts with the local bone factory.\nBefore he even starts proving his worth, he loses 5 of these 6 contracts due to upper-caste political pressure.\nThe non-Dalit contractors do everything in their power (and even outside it) to stop a fledgling Dalit contractor from moving upward on the pyramid.\nOne more thing.\nThe only contract he\u2019s allowed to keep involves \u201ccleaning bones and packaging waste material.\u201d In other words, what an Untouchable \u2013 be he a contractor or not \u2013 should do.\n5. \u201cBhadrachalam Scheduled Area, Telangana\u201d \u2013 Dalel Benbabaali\nMany authors claim that education is the first step toward vertical mobility and equality; tell that to India.\nIn Dalel Benbabaali\u2019s essay about the Bhadrachalam Scheduled Area in Telangana, we learn how the Koyas (Adivasi) and the Madigas (Dalit) are kept in check by the local upper echelons (the former Kamma agricultural castes) which deny them the right to education.\nIn an analyzed example, a local Kamma landlord continually obstructs the efforts of local school teachers to educate the children of the Koyas and the Madigas above grade 7.\nThe reason?\nHe was never educated beyond that! \nBenbabaali demonstrates once again the dark side of free market fundamentalism: many government regulations (even constitutional provisions are not an exception!) are overturned daily in the name of industrial capitalism.\n6. \u201cChamba Valley, Himalaya, Himachal Pradesh\u201d \u2013 Richard Axelby\nRichard Axelby\u2019s article in \ndeals with the Chamba Valley in Himachal Pradesh and two \n (aka Untouchables): the Gaddi and the Gujjar (Muslim).\nNow, if Dalel Benbabaali shows how upper castes exert control over scheduled tribes by denying them the right education, Richard Axelby demonstrates how even that is not necessary anymore since the tribes themselves do not believe in the emancipatory potential of education.\nWhy?\nBecause regardless of education, many Dalits and Adivasis are simply denied proper SC/ST (scheduled caste/scheduled tribe) status.\nWithout these documents, they are by definition not allowed to employment reservations, which means that all of those years they\u2019ve spent learning are for, well, naught.\nAxelby examines how the switch from pastoralism to agriculture has affected the Dalits and the Adivasis and how nomadism and seasonal migrations have resulted in many Dalits and Adivasis losing SC/T status in native jurisdictions.\nIn other words, even the government doesn\u2019t help; in fact, quite on the contrary.\n7. \u201cNarmada Valley and Adjoining Plains, Maharashtra\u201d \u2013 Vikramaditya Thakur\nIn Vikramaditya Thakur\u2019s article of the conditions in the Narmada Valley and the adjoining plains in Maharashtra, we learn of the fate of the Bhils (or Bheels), the largest tribe group in India.\nThakur examines all the difficulties the Bhils have faced (and are bound to face) regardless of whether they have stayed in their traditional villages, migrated to towns for work or have been resettled via the \n.\nStrangely enough, the results of each choice amount to pretty the same: in villages or towns, by dams or in factories, the Bhils end up being oppressed by dominant castes (say, the Gujars of Gujarat).\nSimply put, if you\u2019re Bhil, you don\u2019t stand a chance \u2013 no matter what you do!\n8. \u201cThe Struggles Ahead\u201d \u2013 Alpa Shah and Jens Lerche \nThe last chapter of \nfunctions as a sort of a conclusion to the book.\nIn it, Alpa Shah and Jens Lerche list the findings presented in the articles summarized above and describe the problems that lie ahead.\nUnfortunately, the latter are as many as you\u2019d expect.\nAnd it seems that the authors are not feeling that optimistic as to whether any current politician is interested in understanding them and finding ways to overcome them.\nKey Lessons from \u201cGround Down by Growth\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There Are Two Indias\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Free Market Capitalism Hasn\u2019t Solved India\u2019s Problems: It Has Worsened Them\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Marginalized Will Always Be Marginalized\u2026 Unless the Government Does Something About It\nThere Are Two Indias\nOnly the US, China, and Germany have more billionaires than India, something practically unimaginable until just about a few decades ago, i.e., before the liberalization of markets and the introduction of more \n capitalism.\nHowever, at the same time, there\u2019s another India, one \u201cof dislocation and despair,\u201d in which the poor of the past are now only absolutely wealthier, but relatively both more destitute and unhappier.\nFree Market Capitalism Hasn\u2019t Solved India\u2019s Problems: It Has Worsened Them\nMany proponents of free-market capitalism claim that the \u201ctrickle down\u201d effect should, in time, solve problems such as poverty and inequality to a pretty satisfactory margin.\nHowever, as far as India is concerned, this \u201ctrickle down\u201d effect is a \u201cslow drip\u201d and, as a few studies show it is exactly this mechanism which entrenches inequality, rather than obliterating it.\nAnd since the rich \ngetting richer by huge margins and the poor by minimal, actually India\u2019s poor of the past are all the poorer now.\nIn fact, \n.\nThe Marginalized Will Always Be Marginalized\u2026 Unless the Government Does Something About It\nReading through the articles in \n, one gets the feeling that the marginalized groups of India just can\u2019t catch a break.\nNo matter what they do, no matter how much they try, they are simply incapable of moving a few steps upward the caste pyramid \u2013 due to higher-caste obstructions and corruption.\nIn a way, it seems that unless the government does something about these groups and their rights, they will always be the exploited ones.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cGround Down by Growth Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nmay be considered a bit biased by some (it is unabashedly left-leaning and pro-Marxist throughout), but if the words tend to lie, the stats never do; and all of them, rather than shouting \u201cprogress for everybody,\u201d seem to whisper \u201cprogress for the privileged.\u201d\n\u2013 to quote a review by Jayati Ghosh from the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, \u2013 \u201cexplodes the myth of the modernizing power of capitalism. This sensitive and acute analysis shows that, far from doing away with inherited inequalities of power, Indian capitalism uses and intensifies them.\u201d\nHigh quality, attentive, humane; and highly recommended."},

And Why?\nThe first thing that sprinkles into our mind is everyone.\nAnd why?\nIs it because we are all fu*ked, or is it because we are brainwashed into believing that certainty is the pathway we should follow?\nIn \u201c\n\u201d Gary paves the way for a new methodology to take its turn, composed of discomfort, restlessness, and risk-taking.\nBy the same token, we got the feeling that everyone would benefit from reading it and implementing some of the tips.\nAbout Gary John Bishop\n is a bestselling author, an Urban Philosopher and a speaker whose rhetoric has lit a fire in the hearts of thousands.\nThe grit, determination, and eagerness he nurtures made him a renowned and thoughtful person.\n is expected to go live on May 7\n 2019.\n\u201cUnfuck Yourself PDF Summary\u201d\nAre you ready to be woken up?\nIf you can get past the universal slap that you are about to receive, you\u2019ll be able to make great things happen.\nThe little voice that keeps telling \u2013 \u201c\n\u201d is about to test its own medicine.\nMost people reckon that introverts, for instance, spend more time talking to each other than extroverts.\nBut that\u2019s not quite true.\nThe latest psychological research has shown that the type of talk you are most like to engage in has a tremendous effect on your performance.\nOn top of that, there\u2019s an unbreakable connection between what we say, and what we feel.\nIn all honesty, there are a lot of things that we do which can be labeled as irrational.\nWe do them anyways!\nDramatic self-talk can be best described as dis-empowering mind-chat which is out of keeping with common sense. \nMost people roam around demanding to be treated with respect and get all the acknowledgment they deserve. \nBut it\u2019s entirely ignorant to rely on other people, and \n; not to yourself.\nWhat\u2019s the easiest way to shape our thoughts?\nThrough, conscious and positive self-talk.\nBut sometimes we fall victims to our mindset and get pulled into this bubble. In an attempt to pop it, we might end up hurt as well.\nBut don\u2019t feel discouraged, because you can steer your life in the way you deem fit by determining your emotions.\nThe way we talk, the way we move, the way we think forms our reality, and creates our future. The foundation of life rests on your shoulders, and you should seriously stop blaming luck and other people for your setbacks.\nIt\u2019s even absurd saying this because it makes so much sense.\nOne of the most common mistakes most of us make is talking about what are we going to do, or what should we become.\nSometimes, all it takes is a little bit of faith to get things rolling.\nYou have to be willing before miracles happen!\nPutting \u201cAm I willing\u201d in front of every question is a powerful exercise that gives you enough momentum to seize the day.\nIn reality, we often see \n (a label) which could be put on the same page as being lazy, but that\u2019s not always the case. A more reliable statement would include unwillingness as probably the only instigator of this sense of aimlessness. \nUsually, it takes some time to get the broader picture and being able to differentiate between the sense of eagerness and being evasive.\nPerhaps, you need to work on your unwillingness, especially when you are about to put a statement forward while avoiding the red flags.\nIn this case, those signals are assimilated into our willingness/unwillingness to do what needs to be done. \nLet me give you an example:\nI am willing to get this done; I am unwilling to stay in a job that I hate from the bottom of my heart. \nAs you can see, expressing emotion can be a \n.\nAs of now, both assertions can be construed as a reward integrated into a caveat.\nOkay, now for the big shock!\nWTF?\nDefining goals, is by far the most critical part of our lives, or is it? Is it enough to list a couple of goals, and look at them on a daily basis?\nLet\u2019s say that you want to be filthy rich, drive a Mercedes, live in a mansion and have more money than you can spend in your lifetime?\nNow, for the responsibilities!\nAre you ready to work 65-80 hours a week? Withstand the immense pressure of decision-making daily; skip vacations and exert yourself to complete the job, right now?\nOuu yeah, did you really think that you\u2019ll be lying on a beach, with a tropical drink in your hand, while your army of highly-qualified but poorly paid workers and executives do the backbreaking work? Well, you must be living in the industrial era!\nThere\u2019s a lot of social expectations out there, and it has produced a lot of unfulfilled and desperate humans. \nNobody is saying that you shouldn\u2019t aim for the stars!\nGary only implies that not all people wish to have that life and not wanting to sacrifice your freedom to be a millionaire is perfectly fine.\nAs a matter of fact, we only focus on the things we don\u2019t have.\nYour reality is not an outward reflection of your feelings, but an inner manifestation of your beliefs.\nFace your reality, and try to subdue your addiction for certainty.\nWhat addiction? \u2013 Allow us to explain!\nIt\u2019s no secret that people are apt to embark on the safest path in an attempt to be out of harm\u2019s reach. \nFor instance, we buy the goods from brands we know, even though some alternatives offer the same quality for a lower price. On top of that, we date for months even years in order to secure our financial and reproductive future and reduce risk.\nThe reality you don\u2019t want to be brought into is what we call a certain outcome \u2013 an addiction.\nBear in mind, that seeking safe harbor and shelter can be counterproductive for two obvious reasons:\nLet\u2019s unpack both of them.\nWhether you are in a coffee shop or taking a morning jog, you cannot be certain about what\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s within the uncertainty where we often find joy and concealed courage to do the inevitable. Besides, how many times a situation that heralded hopelessness turned out to be life-changing and productive? \nThat\u2019s why Gary reckons that wanting to tackle the uncertainty is not sustainable and can never be the instigator of success.\nIn addition to that \u2013 how many times, you decided to back out of something, in order not to be judged?\nWell, as some sort of consolation prize, we can say that you are not the only one.\nThere are not a lot of people who have the winner\u2019s edge, and those that do, are geared up with one particular asset \u2013 not fleeing from the field of judgment.\nStep forward and be ready to take some punches!\nIf you want to win on the long-haul, you must grind the sense of certainty beneath your feet.\n \u2013 should be your mantra!\nAt this moment, you must be nodding your head as a token of approval, wanting to test this new medicine.\nTo truly excel, don\u2019t shy away from opportunities and seize upon whatever life is throwing at you.\nIn other words, you should stretch your comfort zone, and try to see what\u2019s behind the horizon.\nDoing something completely different than what you are used to, could be the lifeline you\u2019d be hoping to reach.\nWhen the pursuit for certainty comes to a standstill, you\u2019ll be able to see the bigger picture of life, often composed of things that you so casually disregarded before.\nWith this said, it\u2019s time to identify the arch enemy; or the thing which impedes this transformation!\nYou are not required to do anything other than looking deep into yourself.\nYour thoughts and the nurturing image you have of yourself is the instigator of this emotional malaise.\nIt\u2019s impossible to police your thoughts and decide what goes in or out.\nHowever, you are entitled to define your engagement with these sensations.\nFor example, you believe that successful people never doubt themselves, or never had experienced some personal crisis, but that\u2019s far from the truth?\nThe only difference between you and them is in action.\nWhile you lose focus and being \n, they act anyway.\nYou just need some willpower to perform bravely and put up a lot of work in the things that hold special meaning to you.\nOf course, there will be periods when you\u2019d be unwilling to go to work, or even get out of your bed, but that\u2019s only normal.\nThoughts without actions are like cars without gas.\nUnless you feed them with belief and take appropriate follow-up actions, they\u2019ll vanish in the wind.\nSo, it\u2019s you who decide, which thought should you act upon and which one should be neglected or cast aside.\nAnd today you should do something that you wouldn\u2019t normally do or endorse.\nGet a different kind of breakfast, break words with someone or bypass the emotional burden that keeps sticking to the \u201cknown.\u201d\nBtw, have you ever given any second thought about people who could be regarded as successful?\nThey all had some issues, but that didn\u2019t stop them from taking action.\nIt\u2019s needless to say that great success is not born within the confines of the \n but in the state of discomfort and uncertainty.\nRemember this and understand that relentlessness is often misconstrued as some disobedience, contrary to the formula leading to prosperity.

Glover would like to quote Alice Cooper for you:\n.\nWho Should Read \u201cNo More Mr. Nice Guy\u201d? And Why?\nIf you think that you\u2019re giving more than you\u2019re receiving and you are afraid that you\u2019ve neither lived up to your full potential nor built a stable and loving relationship, then \n is definitely the book for you.\nThink of it as a more rational and less misogynistic version of \n.\nFor Nice Guys.\nAbout Dr. Robert Glover\n is an American author and speaker, \u201can internationally recognized authority on the Nice Guy Syndrome.\u201d\nHe is a frequent guest on radio talk shows and has been featured in many publications, dubbed \u201cemerging figure in the Men\u2019s Movement\u201d by \n \n and \u201ca psychology guru\u201d by \n is his only book so far.\nFind out more at \n. \n\u201cNo More Mr. Nice Guy PDF Summary\u201d\nThe Nice Guy Syndrome\nAccording to Dr. Robert Glover, there are many men who \u201cbelieve that if they are\u00a0\u2018good\u2019 and do everything \u2018right,\u2019 they will be loved, get their needs met, and have a problem-free life.\u201d\nHe calls these men Nice Guys, and he thinks that they are everywhere (\n).\nYou\u2019ll see them in your relative who lets his wife run the show or in your buddy who\u2019s always there for everyone though his life is in shambles.\nYou\u2019ll also see them in the guy who never says \u201cno\u201d to anyone and has absolutely no time for himself, and in the man who lets people walk all over him because he doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat.\nFinally, you\u2019ll see him in the mirror if you can describe yourself along these lines.\n\u201cEvery Nice Guy is unique,\u201d writes Glover, \u201cbut all have a cluster of similar characteristics. These traits are the result of a \u2018script,\u2019 often formed in childhood, that guides their lives. While other men may have one or two of these traits, Nice Guys seem to possess a significant number.\u201d\nAnd here they are:\n\u2022 \n. Nice Guys believe \u2013 and frequently state \u2013 that helping other people makes them feel better and happier;\n\u2022 \n. Even without being asked, Nice Guys often try to fix other people\u2019s problems, regardless of the type or severity.\n\u2022 \n. The universal trait: everything a Nice Guy does or says is at some level calculated to gain someone\u2019s approval or avoid disapproval; and that someone is often a woman.\n\u2022 \n. Nice Guys hate when things are not running smoothly.\n\u2022 \n. These men are afraid that others will get mad at them, shame them, or leave them if some mistake or shortcoming is exposed.\n\u2022 \n. They believe there \n such a thing.\n\u2022 \n. Nice Guys tend to analyze rather than feel. \n\u2022 \n. Because oftentimes, they had been neglected by them.\n\u2022 \n See above.\n\u2022 \n. These men often feel that it is selfish to put their needs first.\n\u2022 \n Many Nice Guys report that they are only happy if their partner is happy. \nOK, you say, I know quite a few people who share at least half of the characteristics above, but they are, well, Nice Guys.\nWhat\u2019s wrong with being a Nice Guy?\nWell, in a nutshell, it\u2019s utterly unhealthy; \n, and Nice Guys are actually Nice merely on the surface. \nBelow it, most of them share at least some of these Not-So-Nice Traits:\n\u2022 \n. Hiding your mistakes, repressing your feelings and avoiding conflict by saying what people want to hear (and not what you want to say) makes you a dishonest person, doesn\u2019t it?\n\u2022 \n.\n\u2022 \n They harmonize contradictory pieces of information about themselves by separating them into individual compartments of the mind.\n\u2022 \n. Since they don\u2019t want to ask what they actually want explicitly, Nice Guys frequently resort to manipulation when trying to get their needs met.\n\u2022 \n. \n\u2022 \n. Though they are generous givers, they also expect something in return; and they feel really hurt when they get little or nothing.\n\u2022 \n. Nice Guys express their frustrations and resentment in indirect, roundabout, and not so nice ways (being late, forgetting, not following through, etc.)\n\u2022 \n. Because they repress so much, Nice Guys are ticking bombs.\n\u2022 \n. \n\u2022 \n. They don\u2019t know the words \u201cno,\u201d \u201cstop,\u201d\u00a0or \u201cI\u2019m going to.\u201d \n\u2022 \n. \n\u2022 \n. \n\u2022 \n \n \n. Despite their talent, they fail to live up to their potential.\nSo, what to do?\nWell, recovery from the Nice Guy Syndrome, writes Dr. Glover, \u201cisn\u2019t about going from one extreme to another. The process of breaking free from ineffective Nice Guy patterns doesn\u2019t involve becoming \u2018not nice.\u2019 Rather, it means becoming \u2018integrated.\u2019\u201d\nNot really sure about what an integrated male is?\nHere are a few attributes so that you understand better:\n\u2022 He has a strong sense of self. He likes himself just as he is.\n\u2022 He takes responsibility for getting his own needs met.\n\u2022 He is comfortable with his masculinity and sexuality.\n\u2022 He has integrity. He does what is right, not what is expedient.\n\u2022 He is a leader. He is willing to provide for and protect those he cares about.\n\u2022 He is clear, direct and expressive of his feelings.\n\u2022 He can be nurturing and giving without caretaking or problem-solving.\n\u2022 He knows how to set boundaries and is not afraid to work through conflict.\nIn short, \u201can integrated male doesn\u2019t strive to be perfect or gain the approval of others. Instead, he accepts himself just as he is, warts and all. An integrated male accepts that he is perfectly imperfect.\u201d\nThe Making of a Nice Guy\nNow, why are some guys nice, when, on the surface, it seems evolutionary pointless?\nIn other words, why should some people invest so much energy to become something that they are not when this brings them nothing but rage, anger, and disappointment in return?\nSure, there are benefits to being manipulative when it brings you money, glory, or sexual partners; but Nice Guys get nothing even remotely similar to this; on the contrary, in fact \u2013 they lose almost everything.\nSo, why do Nice Guys exist in the first place?\nGlover\u2019s response:\nIn a way, the Nice Guy is an evolutionary mistake: the result of the misinterpretation of some childhood experiences and the misuse of some survival mechanisms.\nNamely, Nice Guys have usually experienced abandonment in their early years and do not want to live through that experience again.\nSince they blame themselves for it, in their adulthood they think along the lines of this faulty logic: IF I can hide my flaws and become what I think others want me to be\u00a0THEN I will be loved, get my needs met, and have a problem-free life.\u201d\nNice Guys hide their true selves from the world because they believe that their true selves \n the problem; and, thus, they make the problem worse.\nLearn to Please the Only Person Who Really Matters\nThe process of becoming an integrated male starts with a rather simple question: dear Mr. Nice Guy, how would you live your life if you cared not one bit about other people\u2019s thoughts and feelings about you?\nThe same question can be reused in relation to Nice Guy\u2019s relationships: what would you do differently in your relationships (be it with women or friends) if you weren\u2019t interested in the approval of other people?\nBecause Nice Guys have got it all wrong: you shouldn\u2019t change yourself to deserve other people\u2019s approval, but you should spend your life around people who\u2019d approve you just the way you are.\n\u201cNice Guys find many creative ways to cover up their perceived flaws and mistakes,\u201d notes Dr. Glover, and these are not limited to lying and fixing.\nFor example, most Nice Guys go into DEER Response mode whenever they do something wrong or fail to do something right and are subsequently confronted by their partners, friends, or bosses.\nDEER is an acronym which stands for Defend, Explain, Excuse, Rationalize \u2013 four fear-based behaviors which feed the Mr. Nice Guy persona on a daily basis.\nBecoming an integrated male starts with identifying the moments when you resort to these behaviors and try to do everything in your power to prevent yourself from acting them out.\nYou don\u2019t have to excuse yourself for 98% of the things you excuse yourself for; you are not a bad person, and it\u2019s only normal to believe that your dreams and desires are more important than the dreams and desires of everyone else.\nEverybody does that.\nAnd until you harm someone, you should also do everything within your power to making your dreams come true.\nOnce again, \n does that.\nMake Your Needs a Priority and Reclaim Your Personal Power and Masculinity\n, Cormac McCarthy says that it\u2019s pointless and ludicrous to spend your only life here on earth doing something you don\u2019t want to do.\nAs he says, \u201cbeing able to live your life and being able to do what you want to do\u201d should be your number 1 priority.\nAnd unless you make it so, nobody else is going to do it for you; you are responsible for what\u2019s happening to you, and you need to start taking actions if you want good things to come your way.\nBe assertive and stop acting like you\u2019re the victim; start expressing your feelings and start setting boundaries; don\u2019t treat people and circumstances like problems that need to be fixed: see them as merely people and circumstances.\nThat way, it\u2019d be easier for you to walk away from them when things get rough; life is messy, and sometimes they do; however, this doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s your responsibility to fix them.\nEnd bad relationships and start new ones; it\u2019d be better both for you and your partner.\nReclaim your personal power. If you need a summary, always remember that it is a six-step process which includes:\n\u2022 Surrendering.\n\u2022 Dwelling in reality.\n\u2022 Expressing feelings.\n\u2022 Facing fears.\n\u2022 Developing integrity.\n\u2022 Setting boundaries.\nKey Lessons from \u201cNo More Mr. Nice Guy\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nice Guys Are Actually Not-So-Nice\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a Way, Nice Guys Are Evolutionary Mistakes\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The World Belongs to the Integrated Males: Become One\nNice Guys Are Actually Not-So-Nice\nHow many times have you heard something similar to: \u201cBut how could that happen? He seemed like such a nice guy\u2026\u201d\nProbably one too many.\nWhy?\nBecause Nice Guys are usually, under the surface, not so nice.\nThe fact that they are constantly helping other people, trying to fix situations and repress their own feelings and needs takes its toll in time and results in them becoming passive-aggressive and angry individuals who feel as if some kind of cosmic injustice has been done to them.\nAnd that\u2019s when things fall apart.\nIn a Way, Nice Guys Are Evolutionary Mistakes\nBoys become Nice Guys not because they want to become nice, but because they believe that this is the only way for them to get the approval they lack.\nUsually, Nice Guys feel abandoned in their formative years and grow up believing that this is their fault.\nTheir way to cope with it?\nTo hide who they really are. \nIn their mind, the things they did when children \u2013 and when feeling like themselves \u2013 were wrong and now, if they do everything differently, they\u2019d probably get the problem-free, conflict-less life they\u2019ve been dreaming about.\nOf course, it doesn\u2019t work that way!\nThe World Belongs to the Integrated Males: Become One\nNice Guys, says Dr. Glover, do not evolve by becoming the opposite of what they are \u2013 aka Not Nice Guys \u2013 but by becoming Integrated Males.\nIntegrated Males like themselves just as they are and take responsibility for their own needs; they are comfortable with their masculinity and sexuality and do what they believe is right, not what is expedient.\nThey are clear, direct, and expressive, and willing to protect those they care about in a much more direct no-nonsense way.\nFinally, they are also caring; Nice Guys confuse caring and caretaking, but Integrated Males are almost never caretakers.\nAnd that\u2019s a great thing!\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cNo More Mr. Nice Guy Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nAs we said in the \u201cWho Should Read\u201d section, \nis a diluted version of \n\u2013 or, better yet, the latter one radicalizes many of its core ideas.\nThis is good since, at least in our eyes, it makes \nboth\nmuch more readable and much more approachable.\nOnce again, however, we are not big fans of all this masculinity-in-crises mode of thinking, and we\u2019re not that sure that nice guys should change that much.\nAt least as far as we are concerned, in fact, we actually a few more nice guys in the world; and we really don\u2019t think that nice guys are, underneath it all, not-so-nice.\nThat\u2019s basically a contradiction in terms."},

In addition, several of Gaiman\u2019s novels \u2013 such as \n, \n, and \n\u2013 are considered masterpieces; all three have been adapted into successful movies or TV series.\nFind out more at \n. \nPlot\n is neither a novel nor an original work: it is a series of interconnected Norse myths, somewhat reimagined by Neil Gaiman and retold in his well-liked style. \nIn other words, you can read much more about each of the myths retold in this book on, say, Wikipedia; however, you\u2019d be missing all the fun and the pretty unforgettable Neil Gaiman flavor.\nHere\u2019s a great example on how effortlessly Gaiman combines dark imagery with humor, taken from the chapter titled \u201cFreya\u2019s Unusual Wedding;\u201d you don\u2019t need to know the characters to enjoy it, but if you want to meet them, see below: \nAn Introduction\nIn the \u201cIntroduction\u201d to \n, Neil Gaiman explains three things:\n\u2022 The cultural and literary significance of Norse mythology;\n\u2022 The difference between the traditional representations of these gods and heroes and the way they have been reimagined in popular culture; and\n\u2022 The sources he used and how he used them to retell these myths and stories as accurately as he could, and as interestingly as possible. (Mostly these include many different translations of Snorri Sturluson\u2019s \n, the verses of \nand \n by Rudolf Simek).\nIn the \u201cIntroduction,\u201d Gaiman also explains how he fell in love with Norse mythology, and how he was fascinated to learn as a child (mostly via reading and rereading \n by Roger Lancelyn Green) that, unlike any other gods, the Norse gods came with their own doomsday.\nYup, you\u2019ve heard that right: according to all prophecies, the Norse gods are destined to face the frost giants in a battle to end all battles called Ragnar\u00f6k (or the Twilight of the Gods), and they (\n of them) are supposed to die:\n\u201cThe Norse myths are the myths of a chilly place,\u201d concludes Gaiman, \u201cwith long, long winter nights and endless summer days, myths of a people who did not entirely trust or even like their gods, although they respected and feared them.\u201d\nAnd these are some of them.\nThe Players\n\u201cMany gods and goddesses are named in Norse mythology,\u201d informs us Gaiman at the beginning of his book. \u201cMost of the stories we have, however, concern two gods, Odin and his son Thor, and Odin\u2019s blood brother, a giant\u2019s son called Loki, who lives with the Aesir in Asgard.\u201d\nSuitably, the first chapter introduces us these three characters, the main figures in Norse mythology:\n\u2022 \n, the highest and the oldest of all gods; \u201che wears a cloak and a hat and only has one eye, having traded the other for wisdom. He has many other names including all-father, Grimnir, and the gallows god.\u201d \n\u2022 \n, red-bearded, Thor is Odin\u2019s son and the strongest of all gods; he is the Aesir god of thunder and is \u201cstraightforward where his father Odin is cunning, good-natured where his father is devious;\u201d Thor\u2019s weapon is called Mjollnir and is a remarkable hammer forged for him by dwarfs.\n\u2022 \n, the most complicated character in all of Norse mythology; \u201cvery handsome[\u2026] plausible, convincing, likable, and far and away the most wily, subtle, and shrewd of all the inhabitants of Asgard,\u201d Loki \u201cmakes the world more interesting but less safe. He is the father of monsters, the author of woes, the sly god.\u201d\nBefore the Beginning, and After\nAt the beginning of everything, there was nothing but the Niflheim, the mist world, formless and shapeless, and Muspell, the fire world, always burning.\nBetween these two worlds, there was nothingness and a \u201cyawning gap\u201d called Ginnungagap; it was here that the first creature was born, neither male nor female, bigger than all gods and giants there have been or ever will be: Ymir.\nIn addition to Ymir, from the ice there sprang another creature: Audhumla, a harmless cow whose milk nourished Ymir for eons.\nOne day, in his sleep, Ymir gave birth to three giants, one female; and another Audhumla licked a man from a block of ice: Buri.\nNow, this Buri married Ymir\u2019s daughter, and these two had a son named Bor; Bor married Bestla (daughter of Ymir\u2019s son), and these had three sons: Odin, Vili, and Ve.\nIn an attempt to create something out of the nothing, Odin and his brothers killed Ymir and from his body and brains and blood created all the nine worlds.\nThe gods and the giants are enemies ever since the murder of Ymir.\nYggdrasil and the Nine Worlds\nYggdrasil is the name of a mighty ash tree, the most perfect of all trees in the world; it is the tree which connects all the nine worlds created by Odin and his brothers.\nThe second chapter lists all of them:\n\u2022 \n, the home of the Aesir, where Odin, Thor, and Loki (and all the others live);\n\u2022 \n, the realm of the light elves, \u201cas beautiful as the sun or the stars;\u201d\n\u2022 \n (or \n), the home of the dwarfs (aka, the dark elves) located beneath the mountains;\n\u2022 \n, the world of humans, our world; \n\u2022 \n, the world of the frost and the mountain giants;\n\u2022 \n, the home of the Vanir, another race of gods; after a brutal war, now the Aesir and the Vanir live in peace and often visit each other in their respective worlds;\n\u2022 \n, the dark mist world;\n\u2022 \n, the world of flame; and\n\u2022 \n, well, basically, \n.\nMimir\u2019s Head and Odin\u2019s Eye\nThis is a brief chapter retelling the story of how Odin got his wisdom from his uncle \n, the keeper of the spring of wisdom in Jotunheim.\nIt\u2019s Norse mythology, so it\u2019s both unpleasant and heroic: Mimir asked for Odin\u2019s eye and Odin plucked it out. \nAfter Mimir is killed by the Vanir, Odin took his head and still keeps it near the spring and asks it for advices.\nThe Treasures of the Gods\nMany of the stories begin with some mischief by Loki; this one\u2019s not an exception.\nAs a prank, Loki shaves off Sif\u2019s hair, long and beautiful, \u201cthe color of a field of barley at the end of summer.\u201d\nThe problem?\nSif is Thor\u2019s wife.\n\u201cLoki Laufey\u2019s son,\u201d said Thor, \u201cif you do not put her hair back right now, I am going to break every single bone in your body.\u201d\n\u201cDwarfs,\u201d shrieks Loki, recalling that these are capable of making just about anything \u2013 even golden hair.\nIn the end, Loki convinces the dwarves to design much more than Sif\u2019s golden hair \u2013 aka, all of the treasures of the gods, including Thor\u2019s hammer.\nHow did he convince them?\nBy promising them his head; however, he didn\u2019t promise them their neck, and that\u2019s why he got away alive and well from all this.\nOK, not that well: one of the dwarves, \n, sew his lips: they were on the head, after all.\nThe Master Builder\n\u201cThe Master Builder\u201d shares basically the same structure with \u201cThe Treasures of the Gods.\u201d\nA mysterious man comes to Asgard and promises the Aesir to build them an impenetrable wall around their realm; all he wants in exchange: the hand of the goddess Freya.\nShe is the goddess of \u2013 among other things \u2013 beauty and sex, so get used to men wanting her hand in exchange for a big favor.\nNow, the gods don\u2019t want to agree to such an exchange, until they are convinced by Loki, who in turn, hides a card up his sleeve: deadline.\nAnd the deadline for this mysterious man is six months.\nHowever, what neither Loki nor the other gods know is that this man\u2019s horse, \n, is a magical one; and it becomes apparent that the deadline should be no problem for the mysterious man.\n\u201cYou made this mess,\u201d say the gods to Loki. \u201cYou fix it.\u201d\nAnd Loki does: he disguises himself in a mare and seduces Svadilfari; afterward, he even gives birth to an eight-legged horse, \n, Odin\u2019s favorite!\nThe Children of Loki\nThis chapter tells the story of how the handsome Loki seduces the giantess \n, who in turn gives birth to three monstrous, evil children:\n\u2022 \n, a mighty and vicious wolf;\n\u2022\nthe queen of Hel, the realm of the shameful dead, who did not die nobly in battle; and\n\u2022 \n,\n\u201cthe Midgard serpent. One of Loki\u2019s children and Thor\u2019s nemesis.\u201d\nFreya\u2019s Unusual Wedding\nAn ogre named \nsteals Thor\u2019s hammer, the most powerful and fearsome weapon ever created.\nHe vows to return it to Asgard on one condition only: if he is given the hand of Freya in return.\nThe gods \u2013 and Loki, in particular \u2013 have another plan: they agree but have no intention of following through with the terms.\nInstead, Thor and Loki disguise themselves as Freya and her maidservant respectively and go to the ogre\u2019s castle.\nAt the moment when Thrym brings out Thor\u2019s hammer at the wedding banquet, Thor steals it and slays all the ogres.\nThe Mead of Poets\nThis is the longest chapter of Gaiman\u2019s \nbut it\u2019s not exactly the most interesting ones.\nIt concerns the mead of poetry, a mythical drink which is such that makes everyone whose lips touch it either a skald or a scholar; unless you connected the dots yourself already, skald is the Norse word for poet.\nThe mead of poetry was created from the blood of a wise man named \n after he was killed by the dwarves \n.\nAfter some time, Fjalar and Galar also killed a giant named \nand his son \ncame to the realm of the dwarves to revenge him; the dwarves offered him the mead of poets in compensation; he accepted it and gave it to his daughter \nto keep it.\nYears passed before Odin found out; under a false name, he went to work for Suttungr\u2019s brother \nproposing to work for nothing but a few drops of Suttungr\u2019s mead. \nHowever, Suttungr would give none.\nSo, Odin transformed into a snake, stole the mead and then turned into an eagle and flew away with it; afterward, he gave the mead to both the gods and the men worthy of it.\nThor\u2019s Journey to the Land of the Giants\nThis is a strange story.\nThor and Loki travel to the land of the giants, Jotunheim, as guests of the giant king named \n.\nUtgardaloki challenges his divine guests to many competitions and Loki and Thor lose all of them \u2013 to their utter dismay and surprise (after all, they \ngods!)\nHowever, Utgardaloki later reveals to them that he beat them only through the use of illusions: they didn\u2019t try (and failed) to consume more than Logi or run faster than Hugi, but they competed against Wildfire and Thought themselves \u2013 which is what the words \u201clogi\u201d and \u201chugi\u201d actually mean in Norse.\nSo, in a way, this is a story about how even the Norse gods don\u2019t really understand ancient Nordic languages.\nThe Apples of Immortality\nLoki \u2013 as if it is possible to have a good story without him \u2013 is captured by a giant with a Chinese-sounding name, \n.\nSo as to earn his freedom, Loki promises Thiazi that he will steal Aesir\u2019s apples of immortality and that he will bring them to Thiazi.\nLoki does that and, as is only usual with him, this merely creates bigger problems: now the Aesir is mad with Loki and forces him to retrieve them.\nLoki says OK and has no choice but to fight Thiazi.\nFortunately \u2013 for him at least \u2013 he kills him and retrieves the apples.\nThe Story of Gerd and Frey\nThe story of \n and \n is a story of love \u2013 you know, the Romeo and Juliet kind that\u2019s bigger than even the threat of death.\nFrey, an Asgard god, falls in love with Gerd, a giantess.\nIn order to win her love, he needs to prove it by granting the giants his magical sword, the one which is prophesized to save him in the final battle, the Ragnar\u00f6k.\nAnd you know what he does?\nHe gives up the sword.\nGaiman thinks he shouldn\u2019t have:\nHymir and Thor\u2019s Fishing Expedition\nThor\u2019s fishing expedition with the giant \n wouldn\u2019t have been remarkable or interesting if it hadn\u2019t included a meeting between Thor and Jormungandr.\nIf that name rings a bell, that\u2019s one of Loki\u2019s sons, the enormous serpent lurking in the seas of Midgard.\nThor nearly catches it and kills it \u2013 but the emphasis is on nearly.\nUnfortunately, Jormungandr would survive until Ragnar\u00f6k when it will be killed by Thor, who won\u2019t tread more than nine paces before falling dead himself, having been poisoned by Jormungandr\u2019s venom.\nThe Death of Balder\nthe son of Odin and \n,\nis both known as \u201cthe beautiful\u201d and loved as such by everyone in Asgard.\nDid we say everyone?\nWe meant to say \u201ceveryone but Loki.\u201d\nAfter Balder dreams of his own death, his mother Loki makes all living things vow never to hurt her son; and all do so willingly \u2013 with the exception of the mistletoe.\nOf course, Loki uses this information and makes a magic spear which he subsequently gives to Balder\u2019s blind brother Hod, who then (guided by Loki) kills his brother with it.\nThere\u2019s only one vile enough to plan all of this \u2013 realize the gods.\nAnd that\u2019s the demise of Loki.\nThe Last Days for Loki\nAfter the death of Balder, Loki flees Asgard to escape punishment for his vicious crime.\nHowever, the Aesir eventually find his whereabouts and catch him.\nHis punishment?\nBeing bound to a rock for all eternity \u2013 with the entrails of one of his sons!\nThat\u2019s the Viking Prometheus for you!\nNorse Mythology Epilogue\nRagnarok: The Final Destiny of the Gods\nNeil Gaiman\u2019s \nends the only way a book on Norse mythology should: with the Norse apocalypse, the Ragnar\u00f6k, the battle to end all other battles between Loki, his children and the giants on one side and the Aesir on the other.\nEverybody dies in the end, including Thor (killed by the poison of Jormungandr) and Odin (killed by Fenrir); in addition, the world of humans is consumed in its entirety by fire which leaves nothing but ashes behind it.\nLoki, the master planner behind it all, both kills and is killed by \n.\nSeeing the destruction around him, \u201cit is done,\u201d whispers Loki, dying on the battlefield. \u201cI won.\u201d\nHowever \u2013 and fortunately \u2013 Heimdall knows that it is not.\nGrinning through golden teeth flecked with spittle and with blood, Heimdall says:\nSo, there\nhope, after all.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cNorse Mythology PDF Summary Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nNeil Gaiman\u2019s \nis an excellent introduction to the world of gods and tricksters imagined by people who were, in a way, gods themselves.\nSome of these stories will undoubtedly remain with you long after you close Gaiman\u2019s book.\nJust as they stayed with Gaiman and with countless of generations before him.\nMarvelous.\nAnd it comes with a bonus: \n!\nSo you can enjoy this book twice!"},

In this book, Tony describes an approach to creating a corporate culture focused on making people around him happy and thereby increasing their happiness.\nTo build a great company, it is essential to find out what you love to do. This microbook is recommended for anyone interested in conducting a successful business and learning how a company focused on extraordinary customer service, employee happiness, and profitability can coexist. Let\u2019s go?\nDiscovering What You Love To Do\nIn both life and business, you will inevitably come up against success and failure. But what matters is finding out the thing for which you are genuinely in love. Understanding your passion is important because it simplifies all the decisions you have to make. That allows you to always have a definite goal in mind.\nFor example, let\u2019s say you are an entrepreneur who has been offered an excellent opportunity to sell your business. If you know you\u2019re passionate about your business and love the satisfaction it gives you, the decision to decline offers is easy.\nA passion for what you do is more important than making lots of money doing things that you hate. That is why, first of all, you must decide if you will meet the challenge of stopping focusing on just the money and start pursuing your passion.\nOne way to find it is to venture into many different things to see what works. At the very least, these experiments will show you what you do not want to do. The more things you eliminate from your list, the more you will know about yourself and the easier it will be to find your real passion. The closer you get to find it, the less likely you are to go after wrong dreams."},

His books address topics like marketing and advertising, leadership or the way ideas spread.\n\u201cPurple Cow Summary\u201d\nPurple Cow focuses on remarkable marketing and offers a fresh approach to advertising.\n\u2018s\u00a0marketing strategy targets the new fast going consumers that are too busy to pay attention to advertising.\nFor the new type of consumers, there is only one new strategy that will get them to seek out a product.\nThis strategy is the Purple Cow.\nIn \n\u2019s own words,\nThe main idea of the book is that in order for a product to get the consumers\u2019 attention, it needs to be remarkable. If it doesn\u2019t stand out, it will be as invisible as the rest of the products already surrounding us.\nBut how do you get a product to stand out? By building what is worth noticing directly into the product. Building a remarkable product will make it stand out.\nThis way \nYou should also focus on not trying to create a product for everyone.\nDoing so will eventually lead to having a product for nobody. You need to find a market niche and create a remarkable product for that target.\nWhy do we need the Purple Cow in the first place? As there are more and more choices for consumers, it\u2019s harder to get them to buy a new kind of any existing products.\nYour audience gets smaller and smaller, and among the people that might buy your product, most will never hear about it.\nAlso, as the existing products already offer consumers what they need, there is a small chance that any new product could deliver something that will add to customers\u2019 satisfaction.\nAnother reason for which a new marketing strategy is necessary is what Seth Godin calls the death of the TV-Industrial Complex.\nWhen the system worked, the TV ads used to guarantee retail distribution and \n.\nConsumers believed that having a product advertised on TV was the proof of its quality.\nWe need the Purple Cow because the post TV age needs new \n.\nAs the old rules no longer apply, when you realize that the future of a product will not be remarkable, it\u2019s safer to stop investing in it and start building something new.\nAlthough the Purple Cow doesn\u2019t have the same domination the TV ads used to have, it\u2019s clear that this strategy is the best chance a product has.\nThe Purple Cow is the key to success. This means that you need to \nt.\nYou need to be investing in the Purple Cow.\nYou need to invest in products, services, and techniques that are so useful and interesting, that the market will want to listen to what you have to say. You must develop products, services, and techniques that the market will actually seek out.\nAs stated at the beginning, being remarkable means not being afraid to stand out. This is the problem with the Purple Cow \u2026fear.\nStarting with our early school education, we learn that the safe thing is to follow the rules and fit in. This way we can avoid failure.\nUnfortunately, \n.\nWe also believe that criticism leads to failure. So we will do whatever it takes to avoid being criticized, even choose to be boring (and safe).\nWe need to realize that playing it safe is the worst strategy one can take. We don\u2019t have to hide from criticism.\nWhy not? First of all, because having your project criticized doesn\u2019t mean you are being criticized as well.\nSecond, it turns out that people who have projects that are never criticized are the ones who ultimately fail.\nAs most people believe that the best way is to play it safe, the reward for making something amazing is great grate. Being the Purple Cow brings huge benefits.\nThe leader on a market is the leader because he did something remarkable and took the risk of standing out. He is the leader because he is the Purple Cow.\nAlthough there is no formula for creating a Purple Cow, there is a good advice that Seth Godin shares with his readers.\nHis advice is to go for the edges.\nTo challenge yourself and your team to describe what those edges are. And then test which edge is most likely to deliver the marketing and financial results you seek.\nWe learned that the world changed and that the old rules of marketing no longer apply. So what happens in\u00a0marketing?\nThe answer is simple \u2013 marketing also changed. It now refers to everything. It refers to:\nCreating a Purple Cow isn\u2019t\u00a0easy. But if you feel like you have what it takes to develop something remarkable, you should dare to go further. You could start by reading the book and discover everything you need to know about the Purple Cow. Don\u2019t be afraid to stand out. After all\u2026\n\u201cPurple Cow Quotes\u201d"},

And Why?\nThe CASHFLOW Quadrant exemplifies the spirit and mindset of various groups of people.\nIt showcases how one must act to avoid being devoured in today\u2019s digital age of information.\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s clear as to why Robert prescribes \u201c\n\u201d to the general audience.\nAbout Robert T. Kiyosaki\n built a name for himself, after managing to climb the entrepreneurial world in quick succession.\nApart from having written a bestseller which has held a top spot on New York Times bestselling list for half a decade, he has also excelled as an investor, educator, and entrepreneur.\nIt\u2019s also important to say that his teaching methods are not in line with conventional methods for improving one\u2019s financial position.\nAmong other things, he also wrote the following books:\n\u201cRich Dad\u2019s CASHFLOW Quadrant PDF Summary\u201d\nPart One \u2013 The CASHFLOW Quadrant\nBack in the days, when Robert still wasn\u2019t geared up with the right mindset, he found that changing quadrants is anything but easy.\nIt\u2019s certainly complicated to shrug off criticism, remarks, and words of discouragement coming from your closest circle.\nThat especially holds true if you \u201chail\u201d from a family that embraces and nurtures the \u201cEmployee\u201d quadrant (composed of highly educated individuals who prefer safety over freedom).\nThis is only a small list of questions, regularly delivered at Robert\u2019s doorstep. \nThe circle-shaped diagram lays out the irrefutable truth regarding the failure of \u201cA\u201d students.\nLet\u2019s say that a person is highly educated by worldly standards, but it struggles to find emotional and spiritual balance. How will that reflect on its decision-making?\nProbably by compelling him/her to enter into what is known as \nThe irony revolves around the following theory \u2013 this process is presented as an antidote or the formula behind making the right calls. Depriving yourself of real action sooner or later will prove to be self-destructive because people making the most mistakes are the ones winning on the long haul.\nSo, before we move on, let\u2019s take a critical overview of the Four Elements within the Quadrant.\nWhere do you belong? \u2013 is the critical question.\nIt\u2019s absurd to claim that you don\u2019t fall into either of these categories because we all do.\nPoor Dad will teach you to go to school, get a degree, get a nice job, and become a well-paid employee. While, Rich Dad (often less educated in the formal sense of the word) will advise you to absorb the benefits of state-controlled education, build a business and become an investor.\nLet\u2019s debunk the first myth \u2013 \n.\nNot true!\nIn 1985, Robert and his wife Kim were at the brink of financial and emotional collapse. They lived in a small basement room for nine months; making a few dollars here and there to keep food on the table and fuel in the gas tank.\nTheir plight lasted for an entire year, while their friends and family relentlessly pushed the idea of getting a good job.\nAt the time, it was truly a challenge to remain true to their perspective.\nIn 1994, they finally achieved their financial freedom! \nRich Dad, unlike Poor Dad, doesn\u2019t pretend that money isn\u2019t important. On the contrary, he believes that achieving financial stability is the cradle of life itself.\nThe skills needed to excel on the right side of the Quadrant are by no means taught at school. \nIt\u2019s foolish to think that some Quadrants are better than others because it\u2019s beyond doubt that we need people to contribute from all parts of the financial spectrum.\nWith that said, you need a different set of characteristics and skills to flourish in each Quadrant. \nIn other words, it\u2019s not whether you can create a better burger than McDonald\u2019s; it\u2019s about creating a system that serves customers.\nAccording to Rich Dad \u2013 success is a poor teacher. \nYou need to experience loss, in order to get into the right frame of mind and hence climb the ladder of prosperity.\nPart Two \u2013 Bringing Out The Best in You\nWhile playing Monopoly with Rich Dad, Robert learned a couple of lessons that shaped his mindset:\nIn the meantime, Robert realized that money or better yet \u201creceiving money\u201d is a drug like no other. \nRich Dad often said: \nFor precisely that reason, Rich Dad puts emphasis on creating or building a system that makes money for you.\nSchool days are gone; it\u2019s time to build a system around your heart.\nAnd, this what shocked Robert the most, because in the late 70s his wallet company collapsed due to competition and lack of passion.\nAfter years of experimenting and monitoring, Robert Kiyosaki came to the conclusion that it\u2019s safer being on the right side of the Quadrant than on the left.\nSo, how to get rich?\nAbove all else, this is not a get-quick-rich scheme that you ought to follow (no questions asked).\nThe sad reality is, people who work the hardest, are not the ones that get rich. Rich People are outliers; their out-of-box mentality is what distinguishes them from the mob.\nPoor people believe that the goal is to work hard in order to buy things that make them look rich.\nIn fact, rich people want to get as far away as possible from the stream of liabilities.\nBefore we go any further, let\u2019s have a gander at one completely neglected battlefield between the rich and educated.\nRobert recalls one encounter with his Educated but Poor Dad who said: \n\u201c\n\u201d\nRobert calmly replied: \n.\nIt was a clear indication that playing it safe, and trying to be on the right side, was, in fact, the riskiest strategy one could\u2019ve come up with.\nTo be successful, one must be emotionally neutral regardless of the outcome.\nYou have to understand that winning and losing is part of the process, and you mustn\u2019t separate one from the other.\nAs you already know, Robert took the path less traveled.\nThe greatest transition was not the resignation letter, but the itchiness in embracing a full-scale alteration with regards to beliefs and mindset.\nTruthfully, the main reason behind people\u2019s lack of prosperity is not that they lack education or willingness to put up a lot of time and effort into something, but being guided by fear alone.\nOften times, we hear people arguing that there\u2019s some global conspiracy that keeps increasing the wealth gap between the rich and the poor.\nBut, is it beneficial to pass on the blame to some external phenomenon? \nGive it a moment to sink in!\nPart Three \u2013 How to Become Successful B and I\nRobert starts the last section of this book, by pointing out that instead of looking forward to gigantic strides, just take the first baby step.\nIn order to get the ball rolling, you need to be wary of false narratives and misleading information that may stigmatize your endeavors.\nAfter years of research regarding the transition from poor to rich, Robert found out that these people possess three qualities:\nAnd the same applies (only reversed) for families who have lost their fortune in 2-3 generations.\nTo bring awareness to this issue, Robert asked students to fill in their financial statements. Those being on the verge of financial breakdown had an Industrial-Age mindset (or the no tomorrow mindset) which is predicated on the notion that the government should take care of you.\nAlthough the rules have changed, these people still believe in hard work as if that will solve all of their financial problems.\nThe CASHFLOW of the rich starts at \u201cAssets,\u201d and it is steadily distributed to the first box \u201cIncome.\u201d Unlike the middle-class dream, which only strives to cover expenses and liabilities by getting a good six-figure paycheck on a yearly basis.\nRobert often gets asked \u2013 How to initiate this transition and start thinking like a Rich Person?\nFirst off, it\u2019s not wise to jump out of bed and start investing without any previous knowledge whatsoever.\nSo, the painless path is composed of reeducation, trial, learning-by-doing, and ultimately succeeding.\nThe only that ultimately matters is building up your Assets column, which in the Informational Age is of absolute importance.\nHere is the seven-steps formula for achieving financial freedom:\nAfter getting to the bottom of the CASHFLOW Quadrant, a person or a group needs to find out where it belongs.\nUpon illumination, it\u2019s their job to decide their next move.\nAre you eager to evolve, or stay put?\nFor those of you who are not quite convinced in Robert\u2019s philosophy, continue reading and delving into the matter as much as you can.\nBut refrain yourself from making excuses such as:\nThese are all legit reasons, but Robert argues that ascribing security to the left side of the Quadrant, is highly inaccurate.\nIt all boils down to the following statement:\nKey Lessons from \u201cRich Dad\u2019s CASHFLOW Quadrant\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Find your Cash-Cow\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Change Quadrants if needed\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stay in the game\nFind your Cash-Cow\nCash-cow is nothing other than a steady source of income or profits that eclipses all the money needed to initiate it. \nIt\u2019s your job to find a steady stream of revenue by acquiring assets that will be the backbone of your financial liberation.\nStay on it!\nChange Quadrants if needed\nIt\u2019s not appropriate to advise or even to think that all people should move on the right side of the CASHFLOW Spectrum.\nHowever, one must understand that security no longer comes from hard work.\nTimes have changed, and resisting this transition could be the instigator of financial malaise.\nStay in the game\nRemember how Robert overcame the negative voice and dodged the meaningless questions crafted by those who have no financial education?\nWell, you should do the same, because it\u2019s not going to be all sunshine and rainbows.\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free \n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cRich Dad\u2019s CASHFLOW Quadrant Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nRobert T.

And Why?\n\u201cIf you are picking this book up for the first time,\u201d writes Rollo Tomassi at the beginning of \n,\nor had it handed to you by a friend or loved one, and have never heard of the Rational Male or the manosphere or have had any exposure to the ideas I put forth here, I\u2019ll humbly ask that you read with an open mind.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s an understatement!\nAs Tomassi notes just below, chances are you\u2019ll find some (if not most) of the concepts in this book both radical and violently distasteful. \nTrust us: Tomassi is not blowing his own trumpet when he describes them as \u201cconcepts that will challenge your perspective on women, men, how they interact with each other, and how social structures evolve around those relations.\u201d\nTo cut a long story short, you\u2019ll probably think Tomassi is a misogynist after just a few pages of the book.\nSo, it goes without saying: this is \n not a book any woman will ever want to lay its eyes upon.\nAs for the rest of the population, let\u2019s put it this way: \nis for the ones who know who Roosh V and Roissy in DC are, or for the ones who like Neil Strauss\u2019 \nand\nRobert Green\u2019s \nbut hate \nand radical feminism\nEven better: do you remember Tom Cruise\u2019s character in \n? Well, Rollo Tomassi is kind of a real-world version of him.\nAbout Rollo Tomassi\n is the pseudonym of the anonymous author of the blog \n.\nJudging \n published a year ago there, his primary occupation is (or, at least was until very recently) in the liquor and gaming promo business, and he began his online career writing on the SoSuave forums in his early 40s, about a decade ago.\nHe says his real name is \u201cso white-bread generic it almost serves as a form of anonymity;\u201d however, even after showing his face just recently to keep a few seminars and try himself at motivational speaking, he has gone on using his pseudonym, Rollo Tomassi.\nAll of his books \u2013 \n, \n \n, and\n \n \u2013 are compilations of articles published on his blog.\n\u201cThe Rational Male PDF Summary\u201d\nIn the fictional world, Rollo Tomassi is a name attached to an anonymous assailant in the brilliant neo-noir movie \nIn the real world \u2013 with or without the \u201cdouble l\u201d or the \u201cdouble s\u201d \u2013 it is the name of at least two bands and (we guess) the pseudonym of one of the most respected online voices on male and masculinity-related issues.\nYup, that\u2019s where his name comes from.\nKnown for a decade as the no-nonsense blogger behind therationalmale.com and now known even more as the author of three bestselling books of the same title (this one, and two others with differentiating subtitles: \nand \n), Rollo Tomassi is often described as \u201cone of the leading voices in the globally growing, male-focused online consortium known as the \u2018Manosphere.\u2019\u201d \nIf you don\u2019t know what manosphere is, then think of it as feminism only for men, aka meninism; in fact, feminism is one of the things the manosphere hates the most, maintaining that it is responsible for the crisis of masculinity we\u2019re currently in.\nBut, make no mistake: when it comes to gender and sex, \n\u2019s views are (\n) \u201cegalitarian to a fault\u201d when compared to Tomassi\u2019s.\nPredictably, not few men think of \nas \u201cthe definitive work of gender dynamics for this generation\u201d or \u201cthe single greatest counter-culture romance and dating guide of the decade.\u201d\nTomassi\u2019s book is filled with so many concepts and pieces of advice that it\u2019s very difficult to summarize it; basically, each chapter \u2013 \n section \u2013 introduces an acronym, an idea, or a model related to the gender dynamics.\nBelow, we\u2019ve selected some of the most interesting ones; as for the rest \u2013 you can read them for free \n!\n(If you\u2019re a woman\n don\u2019t!)\nONEitis\nWhat is ONEitis, you ask?\nLet us quote Tomassi:\nIn short, if you believe there is something like the One, then you\u2019re sick; ONEitis is the name of your disease.\nAccording to Tomassi, ONEitis is a paralysis, something which hinders your movement, your maturity, and your growth.\nIt is the foundational aspect of \u201cthe framework of the feminine:\u201d you are made to believe that you are less than the man you really are.\nThe truth is \u201cthere are some good Ones, and there are some bad Ones, but there is no ONE. Anyone telling you anything else is selling you something.\u201d\nThe Dynamics of Power\n\u201cIn any relationship,\u201d writes Tomassi, \u201cthe person with the most power is the one who needs the other the least.\u201d\nPower, according to him, is \n foundation of any relationship, whether intersexual ones, familial or business relationships.\nThis dynamic is always in effect, whether you want it or not. \nIn other words, everyone comes in any relationship looking to get something out of it, be it sex, money, love, lifestyle, or children.\nTomassi\u2019s point?\nThe less you need from your partner, the more she needs you. \nNow, you understand how big of a problem the guy suffering from ONEitis has: he has absolutely no power over his relationship and, hence, no freedom whatsoever.\nThe Plate Theory\nTomassi\u2019s plate theory imagines men as spinners of plates and women as, well, plates. (OK, it\u2019s not the greatest of analogies).\nThe main idea behind it is that men should master their trade \u2013 aka, the gender dynamics \u2013 by spinning as many plates as possible.\nSome of the plates will fall off immediately, others will spin for a time and then break, and a third group will keep on spinning throughout.\nSo, the point is not that you shouldn\u2019t commit to a relationship; the point is that you need to do this only after you\u2019ve spanned a few plates.\n\u201cThe essence of plate theory is that a man is as confident and valuable as his options,\u201d writes Tomassi. \u201cThis is the essence of the abundance mindset \u2013 confidence is derived from options.\u201d\nThe Plugged-In AFCs\nHowever, most men nowadays think of monogamy as the only way to live their lives; moreover, they suppress their masculinity, believing that women want harmless men.\nThis is not the truth: women want confident and assertive men, and you\u2019ll not become one if you don\u2019t spin your plates and take a red pill or two.\nInstead, you\u2019ll live your whole life as an AFC, an average frustrated chump plugged into the system.\nYou are already one if you can be described along these lines:\n\u2022 First and foremost, you suffer from ONEitis;\n\u2022 You subscribe to female idealizations;\n\u2022 You believe that supplication is supportive, aka you believe that you must \n so that your partner can \n in your egalitarian relationship;\n\u2022 Some parts of you believe in the Savior and/or the Martyr schema; the former means that you believe you\u2019ll get some sex in return for solving some problems for a woman, and the latter that the more you sacrifice, the more devotion you show;\n\u2022 Related: you believe in the friend\u2019s debt, or the LJBF (let\u2019s just be friends) relationship as a means to prospective intimacy.\nWe can go on, but we guess you got the point: unless you are an Alpha, you are an AFC.\nThe Red Pill Theory\nSo, it\u2019s time to wake up!\nIt\u2019s time that you spill the blue pill you\u2019ve been force-fed ever since your birth and accept the red pill of truth.\nIt\u2019s not really a comfortable one in the world you live in; in fact, some may say that it\u2019s a bit misogynist, while others that it is a fireproof trip back to the Age of the Neanderthals.\nBecause the red pill truth of gender dynamics \u2013 says Rollo Tomassi \u2013 is that men are \n to be the dominant sex; and that women \nthis.\nThose who say otherwise have been brainwashed by feminists:\nIn other words, women don\u2019t want a man who\u2019ll \u201cdo everything they say.\u201d They want to be told \u201cNo\u201d and they want to be around someone who\u2019s secure and confident.\nNothing turns women on as men who are capable of putting their sexual impulse on hold to stick to their own beliefs and ambitions.\n\u201cThis,\u201d says Tomassi, \u201ccovertly communicates to a woman that his goals and determination trump her one real power over him \u2013 her sexuality. That is the man who is the prize, the \u2018great catch,\u2019 the male to be competed for with other women.\u201d\nThe Five Stages of Unplugging\nIf you are an AFC, know beforehand that you need some effort to unplug from the Matrix and accept from the Matrix.\nThe five stages of unplugging \u2013 analogously to the five stages of grief \u2013 look like this:\n \u2013 \n: This is the AFC who\u2019s read books such as this one and still thinks something along these lines: \u201cThese game guys are a bunch of clowns, there\u2019s no way this works on women. Women aren\u2019t stupid. What a bunch of misogynists.\u201d\n: \u201cThis is ridiculous!\u201d \u2013 you think at this stage. \u201cI just want to be myself, and these game guys want me to become a beast. Why wasn\u2019t I born a Natural Alpha? I blame my parents/siblings/teachers/God/liberals/feminists/media/society\u2026\u201d\n: \u201cWell maybe it does have some good points\u2026 but, forget the hot girls, they\u2019re way outta my league. I\u2019ll give it a try if it can help me get around the bases with a Plain Jane. Do I have to wear the fuzzy hat and black nail polish?\u201d\n: \u201cWow, women really respond to this puffed-up act? And I just joined up for this? The world is sad, and so am I\u2026\u201d\n: \u201cMaybe this is the way things really work. I guess I should give up the gender relations mythology I\u2019ve been holding onto\u2026 hey, what do you think of these negs I came up with?\u201d\nAccording to Tomassi, there\u2019s also a sixth stage \u2013 \n\u2013 when men start preferring video games and porn to game rules. \nIt\u2019s a hardly relevant stage, but Tomassi added it for precautionary measures since it\u2019s a common aftereffect of unplugging.\nRollo Tomassi\u2019s Iron Rules\nIn one of the chapters, Tomassi also shares his personal nine Iron Rules of dating.\nHere they are:\n. \u201cAlways be aware of the subconscious balance of who\u2019s frame in which you are operating. Always control the Frame, but resist giving the impression that you are.\u201d\n. \u201cNever, under pain of death, honestly or dishonestly reveal the number of women you\u2019ve slept with or explain any detail of your sexual experiences with them to a current lover.\u201d\n. \u201cIgnore any woman who makes you wait for sex, or by her actions implies she is making you wait for sex; the sex is NEVER worth the wait.\u201d\n \u201cNever under any circumstance live with a woman you aren\u2019t married to or are not planning to marry in within 6 months.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s called birth control because someone is \u2018controlling\u2019 the birth.\u201d (Aka: use condoms.)\n \u201cWomen are fundamentally incapable of loving a man in the way that a man expects to be loved by a woman. Men believe that love matters for the sake of it. Women love opportunistically.\u201d\n. \u201cIt is always time and effort better spent developing relations with new, fresh, prospective women than it will ever be in attempting to reconstruct a failed relationship.\u201d\n \n Always let a woman figure out why she won\u2019t have sex with you, never do it for her.\n. \u201cNever seriously self-deprecate with a woman you intend to be intimate with. Apologizing for a lack of Game isn\u2019t Game.\u201d\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Rational Male\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Men and Women Are Different\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Red Pill of Gender Dynamics\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beat the ONEitis and Become an Alpha\nMen and Women Are Different\nThe underlying premise of \n\u2013 and the manosphere, for that matter \u2013 is fairly simple: men and women are different, and it\u2019s wrong to strive to build a world in which they have the same rights and desires.\nSimply put, they are biologically wired to have different needs, and no matter what we do, this will remain the same.\nTo quote Jordan Peterson: \u201cthe insistence that the highest moral virtue for the modern man is harmlessness\u2026 is absurd. Women don\u2019t even like harmless men. They hate them. They like to claw them apart. What women want are dangerous men who are civilized. And they want to help civilize them. That\u2019s \n.\u201d\nThe Red Pill of Gender Dynamics\n\u201cThe operative framework, the reality we function in,\u201d writes Rollo Tomassi near the end of \n, \u201cis primarily defined by the feminine.\u201d\nHe says that he first became aware of this after watching a popular sit-com with a critical eye. \u201cThere simply were no positively masculine actors or roles on any show, and rather, every male was ridiculed for his masculinity.\u201d\nAnd that was his red pill, the one which awakened him to the fact that feminization and feminine-primacy are everywhere and that we are all plugged into an operative framework which portrays neither the world nor the human beings as they actually are.\nIn other words, each and every one of us has been given (repeatedly!) the blue pill of egalitarianism, even though, in reality, women themselves don\u2019t want to be equal to men; what they want is what almost every female being in the animal world wants: subjection, dominance, and traditional gender roles.\nWe\u2019ve been brainwashed, says Tomassi, and this has led to a blue-pill world in which everything is nice and shiny \u2013 but untrue and prison-like.\nBeat the ONEitis and Become an Alpha\nIf you are a man who believes in the one and true love for all times and a day, then you are actually an AFC, aka Average Frustrated Chump who\u2019s suffering from ONEitis.\nIn other words, you\u2019re plugged into the operative framework of the world which has put you in the prison of feminine and made you unhappy.\nTo unplug yourself, you must become aware of the dynamics of the sexual marketplace. In other words, you must drink the red pill offered to you by the manosphere and realize that you\u2019ll be much more wanted when you need the other gender less.\nAnd this will make you an alpha, the man women want, the Beauty\u2019s Beast.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Rational Male Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nOK, we have to be honest: although we know that many men will find many appealing and even inspiring ideas in this book, we didn\u2019t like \none bit.\nFor one, we believe that (just like Jordan Peterson) it has gotten the \n story wrong. \nNamely, it\u2019s only a truism that underneath our docile, civilized nature we\u2019re savage, animalistic creatures with vile desires and needs.\nIt\u2019s also a truism that these desires differ between men and women: we\u2019ve evolved treading different paths, and the one trodden by men basically commanded them to become beasts; in addition, the one treaded by women required them to look for beasts.\nBeing beaten once or twice a month was the price women had to pay to survive for millennia; being \u201cmarried\u201d to a harmless man a hundred thousand years ago would have probably resulted in their \u2013 and their children\u2019s \u2013 deaths; harmless men are incapable of defending their families when attacked by a lion.\nHowever, it\u2019s the 21\n century, and we\u2019re living in a different day and age; there are no lions anymore. And we\u2019re free to look back at how we got here and \n our evolutionary paths.\nIf an abuse victim is suffering from Stockholm syndrome, you don\u2019t go on and tell her that she\u2019ll just have to live with the condition forevermore; you try to help her. \nAnd it\u2019s not fair that so many meninists are doing the former."},

It\u2019s not \u201catomic\u201d as in A-bomb powerful, earth-shattering events that will change everything in an instant, but \u201catomic\u201d as in tiny, miniscule clogs of a result-oriented machine:\nHow Progress Works, aka Beware the Valley of Disappointment\nThat\u2019s great, you say.\n1% improvement overtime amounts to something more than 1%; but I really think, you add, that, in reality, it doesn\u2019t exactly work this way.\nI\u2019ve tried this numerous times, and every time I end up disappointed: two months of working out for 20 minutes produces no results whatsoever in my case!\nWell, of course it doesn\u2019t: small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold.\nImagine, says Clear, that you have an ice cube sitting at the table in front of you. In the beginning, the room is about twenty-five degrees, but it gradually heats up.\nTwenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight degrees \u2013 nothing happens to the ice cube; twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one \u2013 still the same.\nThirty-two degrees.\nAnd suddenly, the ice begins to melt: \u201ca one-degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change!\u201d\nIn other words, small changes often appear to have no effect whatsoever until a critical threshold is passed; afterward, the magic happens; the effects may be delayed, but afterward they are pretty powerful; \n requires patience.\nDon\u2019t believe us?\nTake it from the San Antonio Spurs, one of the most successful NBA teams in history. This Jacob Riis quote hangs in their locker room for a reason:\nRemember: incremental progress is never linear; and hard work is always stored until its effects are suddenly revealed.\nTrust the process.\nEndure.\nHow to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps\nIn 1898, a psychologist by the name of Edward Thorndike conducted an experiment that, once and for all, revealed to the world how habits work and which rules guide our behavior.\nEver interested in animal behavior, Thorndike decided to put some cats in a puzzle box, designed in such a way that one could escape from it by pressing a certain lever.\nOf course, nobody wants to be locked in a box, so every cat that was put there did its best to find a way out; eventually, each of them did find the magical lever and successfully escaped the box.\nThorndike repeated the experiment many times over; with each trial, the cats got better at finding the lever.\nFor example, Cat 12 took the following times to perform the act: 160 seconds, 30 seconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20, 12, 10, 14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7.\nIn other words, during the first three trials, the cat escaped in an average of 1.5 minutes; during the last three trials, it took Cat 12 no more than 7 seconds to do the same.\nWhy?\nObviously, because it learned to repeat those behaviors which resulted in satisfying consequences and not to repeat those which produced unpleasant consequences.\nAfterward, it let its brain work on autopilot.\nAnd that\u2019s how you form habits as well.\nIn other words, the feedback loop behind all human behavior is pretty simple: try, fail, learn, try differently. With practice, the useless movements peter out, and the useful actions get reinforced. \nHabits are \u2013 to quote Clear yet again \u2013 mental shortcuts learned from experience.\nAs you know full well from Charles Duhigg\u2019s great, great book (Clear shares our opinion) \n, each habit is actually a four-step pattern:\nYou can find more about each of them by reading Duhigg\u2019s book \u2013 or our summary of it \u2013 but, here are brief explanations which should make this summary self-contained as well:\n\u2022 \n: the trigger which predicts a reward: \n;\n\u2022 \n: the motivational force behind every habit; what makes you act; in the case above, \n;\n\u2022 \n: the actual habit you perform: \n;\n\u2022 \n: the end goal of every habit: the cue is all about noticing the reward, the craving about wanting it, and the response about obtaining it; once the reward comes your way, your craving is satisfied;\nYour brain wants your cravings satisfied (it is \u201ca reward detector\u201d); so, it memorizes the steps which lead to this; in our case, phone buzzing becomes associated with phone grabbing, and this creates a neurological feedback loop, aka an automatic habit:\nHabits are created only when everything works on all four stages; if the reward fails to satisfy your craving, the response asks a lot of energy from you, or you never ever happen upon the initial cue in the future, the habit loop will never start or complete.\nWithout the first three steps, a behavior will not occur; without all four, a behavior will never evolve into a habit.\nNow, the key to changing your life for the better is simple: create good habits and eliminate bad ones. \nKnowing the four-step habit pattern helps a lot \u2013 because it makes it very clear what you should do at each step if you want to break a bad habit or, even better, create a good one.\nClear calls his method \u2013 or, rather, framework \u2013 the \n and he describes it thus:\nIn practice, this framework looks like this:\nOr, inverted:\nNow, the bulk of \n is dedicated to explaining in detail these Four Laws of Behavior Change. We\u2019ve summarized them as the Key Lessons one should take from James Clear\u2019s book.\nKey Lessons from \u201cAtomic Habits\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 1\n Law (Cue): Make It Obvious\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 2\n Law (Craving): Make It Attractive\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 3\n Law (Response): Make It Easy\n4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 4\n Law (Reward): Make It Satisfying\nThe 1st Law (Cue): Make It Obvious\nAnne Thorndike is a Boston-based doctor who wanted to improve her patients\u2019 dietary habits, starting with eliminating sodas from their menu and introducing more water.\nAnd \u2013 believe it or not \u2013 she did it!\nHow, you wonder?\nWell, instead of telling them what your doctor has told you numerous times (\u201cDrinking soda is not healthy\u201d), she merely rearranged the hospital cafeteria, so that the refrigerators next to the cash registers contain mainly water (as opposed to exclusively soda).\nIn three months\u2019 time, water sales shot up by 25 percent, and soda sales dropped by 11.\nIn other words, if you want to learn to play an instrument, put the instrument in the middle of your room; want to eat healthier food \u2013 put the salads on the counters, and the snacks all the way back in the drawers.\nBecause sometimes all you need is just a little \n in the right direction.\nThe 2nd Law (Craving): Make It Attractive\nIn 1954, James Olds and Peter Milner did some Frankenstein-like experiments with rats so that they uncover the real nature of desire.\nUsing electrodes, they blocked the release of dopamine, \n: it\u2019s the hormone your body releases when you either do or think about pleasurable activities.\nThe second is more interesting: as (we guess) you know full well, sometimes thinking \u2013 or even dreaming \u2013 about sex can result in the same \npleasure as actually having it.\nThe point?\nDopamine is what drives you to do things, what makes you look forward to them.\nUse this to create habits the same way Ronan Byrne, an Irish engineering student did. Namely, to make himself exercise, he hacked an exercise bike so that it would only allow him to watch Netflix if he is cycling at a certain speed.\nAnother example?\nDon\u2019t want to do the dishes?\nPlay your favorite music while you do them; after a year or so, you\u2019ll forget that you don\u2019t want to do them.\nOh, what happened to the rats?\nThey died, of course. Bereaved of dopamine, they stopped eating, drinking, and reproducing, utterly losing the will to go on living.\nThe 3rd Law (Response): Make It Easy\nThe reason why you scroll so often through your phone is that that\u2019s a lot easier than reading or studying a new language.\nYour brain is not interested in tiring itself needlessly and would do anything to get its reward through minimum effort.\nSo, allow your brain that pleasure.\nIn other words, make the actions which lead to the reward as easy as possible if you want to create a good habit; quite the opposite, if you want to eliminate a bad one, increase the friction between the cue and the reward difficult one.\nWatch a lot of TV? \nThen unplug it and take the batteries out of the remote. \nWant to read some more?\nThen start by forcing yourself to read just two pages a day; you\u2019ll likely continue reading because getting started is the most difficult step toward doing something.\nThe 4th Law (Reward): Make It Satisfying\nThis is the most difficult part of creating a good habit or breaking a bad one.\nWhy?\nBecause the whole of evolution works against you.\nNamely, we evolved in an immediate-return environment, and now we live in a delayed-return one.\nOur ancestors couldn\u2019t care less about long-term plans, because they had much more immediate concerns, like finding a shelter for the night or hunting the next meal.\nOh, and also because nobody could guarantee them that they\u2019ll live to see tomorrow, let alone the next decade.\nHowever, nowadays, you know that you will; unfortunately, your body is still used to this ancient immediate-return framework of living.\nThe tweak?\nAttach some immediate gratification to all of your delayed-return habits; otherwise, it\u2019d be a bit difficult for you to persevere.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cAtomic Habits Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nOne of \n\u2019s 7 \u201cBest Business Books of 2018,\u201d \nis everything you\u2019d expect from a book about habits written after Charles Duhigg\u2019s \n.\n describes it as \u201csupremely practical and useful,\u201d \n as \u201cengaging, hands-on [guide] to break bad routines and make good ones,\u201d and \n deems it \u201ca special book.\u201dAs often, we have nothing to add: \nis all of this and more; you should definitely have a look.\n\n"},

And Why?\nKaizen is a Japanese word meaning \u201cchange for the better\u201d but usually (and more aptly) translated with the phrase \u201ccontinuous improvement;\u201d originally developed and practiced in Japanese businesses after World War II, its philosophy has been applied in many spheres ever since, ranging from psychotherapy to life-coaching, from government to healthcare. \nIt\u2019s so popular, in fact, that it\u2019s certainly one of the few things \u2013 if not \n only one \u2013 that Tony Robbins, Robin Sharma and (of all people) Nassim Nicholas Taleb have in common.\nBelieve it or not, each of them has dedicated a chapter of their most celebrated books \u2013 \n, \nand \n \u2013\nto \n, the Japanese art of gradual and continuous development to perfection.\nUnderstandably, the concept is a staple in many books related to how Japanese businesses are run, such as Hiroshi \u201cMickey\u201d Mikitani\u2019s \n or Jeffrey K. Liker\u2019s \n.\nWritten by a renowned psychologist, \nfunctions as an introductory self-help guide to kaizen, both explicating its foundations theoretically and stressing the significance of applying them to your life, one by one.\nIt is \u2013 as its blurb states \u2013 \u201cfor anyone who wants to lose weight; or quit smoking; or write a novel, start an exercise program, get out of debt, or conquer shyness and meet new people.\u201d\nAbout Robert Maurer\n is an American clinical psychologist.\nCurrently, he is the Director of Behavioral Sciences for the Family Practice Residency Program in Spokane, Washington, an Associate Clinical Professor at the UCLA School of Medicine, and a faculty member of the University of Washington School of Medicine.\nHe also runs the Science of Excellence, a consulting firm whose clients include (among others) Walt Disney, the U.S. Navy, Bank of America, Electronic Arts and even the British Government. \nHe has written several books on the art of self-improvement, including \n (published in no less than 20 languages), \n, and \n.\nFind out more at \n. \n\u201cOne Small Step Can Change Your Life PDF Summary\u201d\npurports to be \u2013 to quote its blurb yet again \u2013 \u201cthe essential guide to kaizen, the art of making great and lasting change through small, steady steps.\u201d\nAs such, in its introductory first chapter \u2013 \u201cWhy Kaizen Works\u201d \u2013 it first describes the power of kaizen to change your life and the mechanisms by which it does; then, in the following six chapters, it portrays each of the main six kaizen techniques you should use to apply the philosophy in any sphere of your life:\n\u2022 asking small questions to dispel fear and inspire creativity;\n\u2022 thinking small thoughts to develop new skills and habits-without moving a muscle;\n\u2022 taking small actions that guarantee success;\n\u2022 solving small problems, even when you\u2019re faced with an overwhelming crisis;\n\u2022 bestowing small rewards to yourself or others to produce the best results; and\n\u2022 recognizing the small but crucial moments that everyone else ignores.\nIn the eighth chapter of the book \u2013 \u201cKaizen for Life\u201d \u2013 Maurer brings his discussion to a close, suggesting his readers that kaizen \u201cis more profound than a tool for simply crossing the finish line,\u201d and that one should think of it much more in terms of \u201ca process that is never done.\u201d \nIf so, he says, kaizen will invite you \u201cto see life as an opportunity for continuous improvement, for ever-higher standards and expanding potential.\u201d\nInterested in such a leap?\nThen \n!\nInnovation vs. Kaizen\nWhether in business or your personal life, there are two ways to break the old routines and introduce something new: either through innovation or through gradual improvement.\nThe former is radical and usually initiates something revolutionary: that\u2019s what Whitney Johnson \u2013 translating Schumpeter and Christensen into the language of self-help books \u2013 talks about in \nGradual improvement, on the other hand, means doing something better than the day before, no matter what, no matter how small.\nThe difference between the two?\nInnovation is a short-term make-or-break strategy that can either bring you great success or result in complete and utter failure; gradual improvement, on the other hand, is a long-term approach and, patience granted, works \n.\nIn other words, if you want to stop smoking cigarettes, you can either do that by deciding to stop smoking them overnight (radical innovation) or eliminate one by one cigarette over a certain period of time until you have no interest in them whatsoever.\nSure, in the first case you can lose the bad habit earlier, but studies have shown that the latter approach is far more successful and has an enduring effect.\nAnd that\u2019s the very essence of kaizen, described by Maurer as the process of taking small steps for continual improvement.\nDespite the foreign name, kaizen is actually an American product, first applied systematically in Depression-era America.\nDeveloped by none other than management guru W. Edwards Deming, its principles were subsequently developed into management courses called Training Within Industries (TWI), which greatly accelerated America\u2019s manufacturing capacity during the war. \nGeneral Douglas MacArthur introduced them to Japan after the end of the Second World War, and thousands of Japanese business executives took them.\nThe rest \u2013 as they say \u2013 is history.\nWhy Kaizen Works\nJust like our society and our businesses, your body is also not built to be able to absorb and implement radical changes overnight; \u201call changes,\u201d writes Maurer, \u201ceven \n ones, are scary.\u201d\n, your brain consists of at least three parts:\n\u2022 \n, aka the reptilian brain, the part of your brain which \u201cwakes you up in the morning, sends you off to sleep at night, and reminds your heart to beat;\u201d\n\u2022 \n, aka the mammalian brain, the one which \u201cregulates the body\u2019s internal temperature, houses our emotions, and governs the fight-or-flight response that keeps us alive in the face of danger;\u201d\n\u2022 \n, which is \u201cresponsible for the miracle of being human. Civilization, art, science, and music all reside there. It\u2019s where our rational thoughts and creative impulses take place. When we want to make a change, or jump-start the creative process, we need access to the cortex.\u201d\nNow, the problem is that to access the cortex you need to first go through the brain stem and the midbrain and the latter one has something called the amygdala.\nNow, the amygdala is responsible for your flight-or-fight response and is not that keen on changes; it also blocks access to the cortex when it thinks that something is too dangerous to deserve contemplation.\nIf there\u2019s a lion, your amygdala says, you don\u2019t really need your brain to think what you should do; you need to either fight or (more probably) run.\nThe problem is \u2013 \n; it reacts the same way in all three situations. \nBut that\u2019s exactly why kaizen works!\nIt basically tricks the amygdala, telling it: \u201coh, come on, you, this is nothing too big or dramatic\u2026\u201d\nOr illustrated:\nKey Lessons from \u201cOne Small Step Can Change Your Life\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ask Small Questions\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Think Small Thoughts\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take Small Actions\n4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Solve Small Problems\n5. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bestow Small Rewards\n6. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Identify Small Moments\nAsk Small Questions\nRobert Maurer introduces the first kaizen technique thus:\nYour brain loves questions and riddles: it treats them as something harmless and accepts them with childlike wonder.\nAnd that\u2019s true even for toddlers who, though inattentive to didactic statements (\u201cThis is a doggie\u201d) are wide-eyed when they hear a question, even if the answer is supplied by the one posing it (\u201cWhat\u2019s this? This is a doggie.\u201d)\nHowever, when you ask questions, you have to be careful and aware not to wake the amygdala; big questions induce fear and this, in turn, shuts down your cortex; in contrast, small questions communicate directly with it.\nHere are a few ideas Maurer shares with his readers:\n\u2022 For the unhappy: \n\u2022 For those with a specific goal: \n\u2022 For those who have a conflict with someone: \nIt\u2019s kaizen, so don\u2019t forget: you need to ask yourself these questions \n than once.\nThink Small Thoughts\nThinking small thoughts is a strategy much akin to visualization; aptly named \u201cmind sculpturing,\u201d thinking small thoughts should help you form a certain response to a certain situation beforehand so that your brain can ignore the panicky amygdala when the time comes.\nThis is how the technique works, broken down into 10 small steps:\n#1. Isolate a task which makes you uncomfortable and give yourself at least a month before actually doing it;\n#2. Allot a few seconds (not minutes!) you\u2019re willing to devote to mind sculpturing this task every day;\n#3. Sit down in a quiet, comfortable spot and close your eyes;\n#4. Imagine yourself in this difficult or uncomfortable situation; what do you see? Who\u2019s there? What do the people look like?\n#5. Now expand your imagination to the rest of your senses: sounds, smells, flavors, textures.\n#6. Imagine that you\u2019re actually doing the task \u2013 but don\u2019t move a single muscle; remember the words, the voice, the physical gestures;\n#7. Imagine a positive response to your actions;\n#8. Do this every day, until the imagining becomes effortless; then increase the length of allotted time for mind sculpturing; if it doesn\u2019t work \u2013 go back a few steps; never force kaizen;\n#9. Once you\u2019re comfortable, imagine the worst-case scenario and start imagining how you would react to it;\n#10. When you feel ready, start with a few small steps before actually doing the big task.\nTake Small Actions\nThe last step of thinking small thoughts brings us to the third kaizen strategy: taking small actions. \nThis one\u2019s self-explanatory, and can best be understood in terms of how it works in real life:\n\u2022 If you think you\u2019re spending too much, then remove \n object from your shopping cart before heading to the cash register;\n\u2022 If you want to tidy up your house, \n; just pick a small area, set your timer for 5 minutes, and do the work; stop when the timer goes off no matter how into the task you are;\n\u2022 if you want to get more sleep, start by going to bed just one minute earlier at night.\n\u201cThese little actions usually sound bizarre to the uninitiated,\u201d writes Maurer. \u201cBut if you have struggled to make a big change-to drop twenty pounds, to change careers, or to steady a sinking romance-and failed, then you might appreciate how small changes can help.\u201d\nAnd, indeed, they can: big, bold efforts to make a change are usually counterproductive, resulting in aversion; small changes result in a new habit; this time \u2013 a good one.\nSolve Small Problems\nYou know how you say to yourself \u201cI\u2019ll do the dishes tomorrow \u2013 after all, there are only three today!\u201d And you know how, a few days later, there\u2019s not one dish clean in your apartment, and every part of your body rages against you getting up of your bed and just going near to your sink?\nWell, that\u2019s because you\u2019re unconsciously allowing kaizen to devolve to a situation when radical innovation is the only way out.\nWhy should you do it?\nSolving small problems usually means the absence of big ones; and small problems are always around you; you just need to identify them and act:\nBestow Small Rewards\nIn the end \u2013 let\u2019s face it \u2013 you\u2019re just an animal; and as such, you can often be easily trained to act properly in much the same manner Pavlov trained his dogs to salivate whenever they heard a bell.\nThe best thing?\nYou don\u2019t need Pavlov to do it.\nYou can do it yourself by bestowing yourself small rewards which can motivate you to continue your path to improvement in the right direction.\nWhat does this mean in practice?\nSimple: find a \n reward and treat yourself with it! \nHowever, always have in mind these three rules:\n#1. The reward should be appropriate \n: it\u2019s certainly not smart to treat yourself with chocolate if you\u2019re on a weight loss program;\n#2. The reward should be appropriate \n: you know yourself best, so don\u2019t let other people tell you what the appropriate reward for you is;\n#3. The reward should be either free or inexpensive; anything from a few more minutes to relax or to spend on your hobby to watching television, playing your favorite piece of music, or soaking in the tub.\nThe point?\nTrick your brain into thinking that you\u2019ll \nget the reward if you don\u2019t do the job which grants it.\nIdentify Small Moments\n\u201cThe kaizen approach to life,\u201d writes Maurer, \u201crequires a slower pace and an appreciation of small moments. This pleasant technique can lead to creative breakthroughs and strengthened relationships, and give you a daily boost toward excellence.\u201d\nUnfortunately, everything\u2019s going too fast nowadays, so we\u2019ve forgotten to appreciate these small moments.\nMaurer offers a series of steps \u201cto help your mind stay open, playful, and alert to small moments, even in emotionally charged situations\u201d:\n#1. Look for a person \u2013 preferably a stranger \u2013 who has an opposite opinion from you on a hot-button topic;\n#2. Start a conversation with him, but not with the goal to sway him from his beliefs: just ask him questions about his position;\n#3. Try not to argue, persuade, or sound judgmental;\n#4. Notice if the person is becoming more relaxed and chattier; if so, you\u2019re succeeding.\nRemember: it is through these small moments (and your reactions in them) that Dr. John Gottman was able to predict (in staggering 93% of the cases) if \n.\nBelieve us: ignoring small moments (pleasant phone calls, arriving home at the promised time, inquiring about dental appointments) is not worth the risk.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cOne Small Step Can Change Your Life Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nSusan Jeffers, author of \n, says that \nis \u201ca wonderful, very readable book that describes a peaceful and simple way of handling all the difficulties in our lives. You will breathe a sigh of relief as you read it!\u201d\nNow, it\u2019s not that Robert Maurer\u2019s book says something revelatory or unearths something surprising and shocking; it\u2019s just timeproof mystical wisdom served in a more digestible package if not more merely because organized and rationalized.\nAnd considering the time we live in, we suppose that that\u2019s something worthy of appreciation.So, do yourself a favor and read \nin one sitting (it\u2019s neither long nor complicated book); however, start applying its principles immediately afterward and do that as long as you live.\n\n"},

{"title": "Business Secrets of the Trappist Monks PDF Summary", "url": "https://blog.12min.com/business-secrets-of-the-trappist-monks-pdf/", "cover": null, "content": "6 min read \u231a\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a lot to be learned from the simple, selfless lives of Trappist monks, as August Turak discovered. His book is a journey to becoming a better person, a better employee, a better leader.\nIt\u2019s about becoming successful by focusing on everything but success and transforming your life (and the lives of those around you) along the way.\nReading this book feels like reading Siddhartha (although a closer match would be a Coelho book rather than Hesse), more specifically the part where Siddhartha \u2013 a man who renounced every worldly possession \u2013 tries and succeeds at being a prosperous merchant by using a spiritual approach for both his business model and for gaining the proper lessons out the experience.\nCompared to other business books\n \nfeels more like literature than business manual.\nENLIGHTENING / BUSINESS SECRETS OF THE TRAPPIST MONKS\n\u201cBusiness Secrets of the Trappist Monks PDF Summary\u201d\nWe\u2019re first presented with the peaceful surroundings of the Mepkin Abbey that our main character, the middle-aged August Turak, one day enters to seek spiritual guidance.\nThe Abbey is home to Trappist monks, a Benedictine order whose values range from pity and selflessness to prayer and work.\nHere we learn, from the very first pages, the superpowers that human beings can achieve just from being selfless.\nLearning French in a few months just to help someone with an essay, for example, is just one the many consequences of a life devoted to the high quality of work that these monks commit to.\nThat kind of approach is the result of wanting to do something greater than the task at hand, to reach beyond making something specific, to transcend in whatever you do to a higher selfless self.\nThere are, of course, some religious aspects found in this book, but Turak doesn\u2019t seem to be very concerned about this part. For him, God is to be \n, no matter if you believe in something or not. Selflessness is part of any human being.\nYou won\u2019t be taught how to mock selflessness in this book. In order to gain profit from your business, you will not learn how to obtain it, and you will not be enlightened after the last chapter.\nInstead\n \n will reveal to you a hard path, a path that goes well beyond its pages, a path where you\u2019ll have to face yourself, time and time again. A path during which self-sacrifice becomes a reflex.\nThe book\u2019s also \u2013 as the name implies \u2013 about business. Those secrets of the Trappist monks are just hard work. Business is more than numbers. \n has a human dimension and that\u2019s far more important than cold business plans.\nHumans are naturally attracted towards greater things than themselves and want to be part of something important. All of us, maybe because of our mortality, need to feel that our lives aren\u2019t lived in vain.\nBusiness is just one aspect in which these tendencies manifest themselves, but it\u2019s important because nowadays work takes up most of our day.\nPeople are also attracted to trustworthy people. Trustworthiness is built on time and through hard work. It requires a strong will and a genuine moral code\nThere are examples of these traits at work throughout Turak\u2019s book.\nWhen a brother in the Mepkin Abbey confessed to Turak that retiring in seclusion was the hardest thing he did, simply because he had to face himself, Turak felt like he could go through hell if his brother asked him to.\nThe authenticity of this simple admission means more than strong pompous words ever can. It taps into our general need for authentic feelings and authentic life. To put that into your daily life and, as a consequence, your work is bound to have miraculous effects.\nAnother important aspect that Turak insists on is the importance of self-sacrifice to a mission and a community. He gives parallel examples of this continuous giving, away from the monastic way of life and from the entrepreneur\u2019s point of view.\nThe purpose of this juxtaposition is for readers to draw their own conclusions about the importance of a higher aim than doing your job, going home, and repeating this without any real progress happening.\nThis idea\u2019s related to the somewhat new trend to make your job your life. But these two ideas don\u2019t live in the same house.\nThe main difference is that Turak\u2019s model proposes the opposite of ego-driven, corporate ladder climbing, weekend-working ideal that corporate America seems to worship. It\u2019s actually the opposite.\nSacrifice has many faces. Admitting a weakness in front of a colleague (especially one that you don\u2019t see eye to eye with), not giving up when things get hard and apologizing if you\u2019ve made mistakes are all expressions of selflessness.\nIn a corporate environment, these selfless acts come as a result of a personal mission to become a selfless individual, as is the case with Turak, or as the result of the company\u2019s mission, its culture, and credo.\nTurak gives an example of this from his own company. He and his associates sat down and decided on the rules of the company. They followed those rules, with Turak at the helm, even in the most desperate situations and with the harshest of consequences, to give a life-changing experience to both employees and customers.\nAll these messages are delivered with the spirit of a man who knows exactly what he wants to transmit, and with the dedication of one who wants to help the reader understand his message.\nThe contents and lessons of \n can be also analyzed by paying attention to the care that August Turak took when writing it. The examples he chooses are situations that any of us can relate to.\nA particularly inspired parallel Turak draws is with the Hero\u2019s Journey, a study by Joseph Campbell based on the myths, folklore and religions of people all over the world.\nThe stages of the hero\u2019s journey are similar in all cultures of the world and can be found in many movies and books. We\u2019re given the perspective of viewing the struggles of our own life as\u00a0stages of the hero\u2019s journey, the hardest one being \u201cthe desert\u201d.\nThis is the part where everything seems to be tedious and going nowhere, and progress is so small and slows it can barely be called that.\nThis path can be kept with great sacrifice and determination, or it can be left behind for being too hard and not giving anything real in return.\nThe reward for choosing this hard path of continuous self-monitoring, living for others and giving as a second nature is complex.

And Why?\nThere\u2019s a reason why, when someone mentions the phrase \u201clegal thriller,\u201d the first two words that come into the mind of many are: John Grisham.\nTranslated into more than 50 languages, his books (and there are about 40 of them) have sold about 300 million copies worldwide! Divide that, and you get an average of about 7 million copies per book \u2013 a staggering number considering Grisham\u2019s output!\nBut, then again, not that surprising: it\u2019s Grisham, so the readers know what to expect: murders and all sorts of crimes, convoluted plots, lawyers, courtroom dramas.\n\u2013 though a non-fiction book \u2013 is not an exception; in fact, it\u2019s even \n than fiction, telling (mainly) the story of Ron Williamson, a former minor league baseball player, wrongly convicted for murder.\nIn the \u201cAuthor\u2019s Note,\u201d Grisham himself notes that \u201cnot in [his] most creative moment could [he] conjure up a story as rich and as layered as Ron\u2019s.\u201d\nAnd an \nreview goes a step further, claiming that, with \n, Grisham \u201chas written both an American tragedy and his strongest legal thriller yet, all the more gripping because it happens to be true.\u201d\nIn other words, if you are a John Grisham fan, \nis probably even \n than what you would expect from a Grisham novel; if you are not \u2013 this is the book to become one.\nThere are little things as universally appealing as true crime stories involving innocent people; which is why Netflix decided to adapt the book in \n, the trailer for which you can find below.\nIf you don\u2019t want any more spoilers \u2013 stop reading here.\nAbout John Grisham\n is an American novelist, attorney, and politician, best known as the author of a series of wildly successful legal thrillers.\nAfter graduating from Mississippi State University and receiving a law degree from the University of Mississippi School of Law in 1981, Grisham went on to practice criminal law for a decade.\nIn 1989, he published his first novel, \n, in a modest 5,000 print run; the book was neither a critical nor a popular success. However, that all changed when two years later Grisham\u2019s second novel, \n, gained him wide popularity.\nBoth books were later turned into movies: \nin 1993, with Tom Cruise and Gene Hackman in the main roles, and \nin 1996, starring Matthew McConaughey and Samuel L. Jackson.\nAll of Grisham\u2019s four next novels were both bestsellers and adapted into blockbuster movies almost as soon as released: \n\u2022 \n(starring Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington); \n\u2022 \n(starring Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones); \n\u2022 \n(starring Gene Hackman and Chris O\u2019Donnell); and \n\u2022 \n(directed by Francis Ford Coppola and featuring an All-Star cast headed by Matt Damon and Danny DeVito);\nFive more of Grisham\u2019s remaining thirty or so novels have been turned into movies as well (\n, and\n), and three others (\n, \n, and \n)\nshould be in the next two or three years.\nJohn Grisham is one of only three authors to sell two million copies on first printing (Tom Clancy and \n are the other two).\nFind out more at \n. \n\u201cThe Innocent Man PDF Summary\u201d\nThough \nis often described as the story of the murder of Debra Sue Carter and the wrongful conviction of Ron Williamson, there\u2019s a lot more to John Grisham\u2019s book \u2013 like the ones who have already binge-watched \n\u2019s docuseries already know. \nTrue, Ron Williamson\u2019s story is the main narrative, but there are a few subplots as well: the purported murder of Denice Haraway especially, as well as the murder of Kathy Wilholt and the wrongful conviction of his husband, Greg.\nThe book itself is divided into 17 chapters and jumps between stories, but, for our summary, we decided to separate the main two cases in two sections and recap each of them in few short chapters.\nHopefully, this should help you follow the main arcs better.\nThe Murder of Debra Sue Carter\nRonald Keith Williamson was a successful school and college baseball player, and when he left high school, he seemed to have the world at his feet. \nHowever, he soon learned that \u201cno star fades faster than that of a high school athlete.\u201d\nFirst, a shoulder injury hindered his chances to become something in the world of minor league baseball and, then, he slowly began to show signs of mental illness, drifting into a life of alcoholism, petty crimes, and misdemeanor.\nOn December 8, 1982, the body of Debra Sue Carter, a 21-year-old cocktail waitress, was found in the bedroom of her garage apartment in Ada. Police investigation showed that she had been beaten and raped before being suffocated. \nWilliamson \u2013 and his \u201cdrinking buddy\u201d Dennis Fritz \u2013 were regular guests at Coachlight, the restaurant where Debra worked, and, allegedly, the victim had complained about them to a friend sometime before being murdered. \nTo make matters worse, a guy named Glen Gore \u2013 who had been seen chatting with Ada on the night before the murder \u2013 claimed in an interview with the police that he had last seen Debbie with none other than Ron Williamson.\nSince he was \u201ca somewhat notorious carouser with a loud mouth,\u201d the police had no problems believing Glen that Williamson might have been pestering Debbie.\nThe investigation made a few false starts, but, then, suddenly, there was a breakthrough. \nYou see, soon after the murder, Williamson was imprisoned for kiting cheques. An inmate of his, Terri Holland \u2013 \u201ca career criminal\u201d \u2013 told the police that she had heard Ron admitting to the crime while in prison. \nAnother informant came forward and stated the same in relation to Dennis Fritz, just one day after the prosecution would have been legally bound to drop the charges against him. \nWilliamson made matters even worse for him when he recounted to the police a dream of his, in which he stabbed and strangled the victim.\nWhy?\nBecause this was treated as a confession.\nCoupled with some shoddy forensic work, this led to Williamson being sent to death row, and Fritz sentenced to life in prison.\nWilliamson\u2019s death sentence was supposed to be carried out on September 24, 1994 \u2013 and six days before that Williamson could be heard shouting \u201cI\u2019m innocent! I\u2019m innocent! I\u2019m innocent!\u201d from his cell.\nFortunately, the next day, a group of appellate lawyers filed a \npetition which saved Williamson\u2019s life.\nThe document which turned things around began thus:\nWilliamson was eleven years on death row when DNA evidence exonerated him and Fritz on April 15, 1999, making Ron the 78\n inmate released from death row since 1973.\nFour years after the release of Williamson and Fritz, on June 24, 2003, the real murderer was found.\nSurprise, surprise: it was Glen Gore, the guy who, in retrospect, had been an obvious suspect from the start.\nHe was sentenced a few years later to life in prison without parole \u2013 but by that time, Ron Williamson was already dead.\nDiagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver, Williamson died in a Broken Arrow, Oklahoma nursing home on December 4, 2004, a year after he won a settlement for wrongful conviction from the City of Ada, and two years before Grisham published his book and Glen Gore was sentenced.\nThe Murder of Denice Haraway\nTwo years after the murder of Debbie Carter, another young girl in her 20s with a night job, disappeared in the small town of Ada: Donna Denice Haraway.\nMarried about a year before her disappearance, Haraway was a 24-year-old student at East Central working at a convenience store.\nTwo young men were seen in the vicinity of the store on the night of her disappearance.\nNaturally, they were the prime suspects.\nThe police received many calls from concerned citizens; no less than 25 names were given by these callers as suspects.\nTwo names immediately stood out by the sheer number of mentions: Billy Charley and Tommy Ward.\nBilly Charley had an alibi: he had been with his parents all through the night. Tommy Ward\u2019s alibi was rather different: he said that he had been fishing and partying with a friend, Karl Fontenot; apparently, that didn\u2019t happen.\nIt didn\u2019t help that Tommy was a high-school dropout arrested several times for misdemeanors such as public drunkenness or petty theft.\nThe police were rather sure that they had their man; or, better yet: their men.\nWhen Tommy Ward was called yet again for an interview, he was asked several times to use his imagination to explain what could have happened in the case of Denice Haraway\u2019s disappearance.\nAnd one day, after a grueling eight-hour session, Ward confessed to the crime; shortly after Fontenot did as well.\nThey were tried for first-degree murder even though they could not tell where the body of Haraway was and even though they had both recanted their confessions.\nAnd it gets even weirder.\nYou see \u2013 and, in a moment, you\u2019ll realize why this is the strangest part \u2013 the reason why Tommy and Karl couldn\u2019t provide the body of Denice was simple: they said that they had burned it.\nIt was a gruesome story, involving \u201cstab wounds, the blood and guts, the brutal raping and knifing of such a pretty girl, then the horrible burning of her body.\u201d\nThe only problem: it wasn\u2019t true.\nHow do we know that?\nWell, on January 21, 1986, in the woods some twenty miles from Ada, the body of Denice Haraway was discovered by a hunter. \nThe body was neither stabbed nor burned.\nThe cause of death?\nA single gunshot wound through her head. \n\u201cThe true cause of death should have convinced everyone involved that Ward and Fontenot had indeed dreamed up their ridiculous tales and had been coerced into confessing,\u201d writes Grisham. \u201cIt did not.\u201d\nEven more: \u201cthe true cause of death should have prompted the authorities to admit they were wrong and begin searching for the real murderer. It did not.\u201d\nInstead:\nThis one\u2019s not even remotely a happy one.\nEventually, Ward and Fontenot were granted retrials, but they were, once again, found guilty.\nAnd to this day they are on a death row, imprisoned for more than three decades.\nEven though everybody knows that it\u2019s very, very likely that they are serving time for a murder committed by someone else.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Innocent Man\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Truth Is Sometimes Stranger Than Fiction\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Your Dreams Can Get You a Death Sentence\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Will Happen Again\nTruth Is Sometimes Stranger Than Fiction\n \u201cIf I wrote \nas a novel,\u201d says John Grisham in an interview for \n\u2019s docuseries based on his book, \u201cfolks probably wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\nAnd you know what \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t.\nTwo mysterious murders occur in a town of 15.000 people in the space of two years; for each, two people are found guilty; the prosecutor is the same guy for both trials; the investigators \u2013 more or less, the same team.\nAnd it doesn\u2019t stop there: in both cases, dreams of the accused are treated as confessions; in both cases, the main witness is the same, a jailhouse informant; finally, in both cases, the men turn out to be innocent. \nIf it was a novel, the reviews would have probably been littered with words such as \u201cimprobable,\u201d \u201cimplausible,\u201d \u201cunconvincing,\u201d \u201cunlikely,\u201d and even \u201cridiculous.\u201d\nAnd yet \u2013 to quote Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \n \u2013 \n. \nYour Dreams Can Get You a Death Sentence\nSpeaking of truth being stranger than fiction \u2013 \nYou\u2019ve probably read/watched Philip K. Dick\u2019s/Steven Spielberg\u2019s \n; if not, in it, people are arrested \n even committing a crime based on the foreknowledge of three psychics called precogs.\nIn an even better example, in Ismail Kadare\u2019s exceptional 1981 novel \n, there\u2019s a whole shady Ministry which analyzes dreams and suggests punishments for people based on dream symbolism.\nApparently, this can happen in real life as well: believe it or not, the dreams of both Williamson in relation to the murder of Debra Sue Carter and Ward and Fontenot\u2019s in relation to the murder of Denice Haraway were treated as real confessions!\nEven \n the evidence demonstrated that they are (unsurprisingly!) incompatible with reality.\nFor all the weight \n and \n put on the significance of dreams, we kind of feel that this is a great example of why \n.\nThis Will Happen Again\nThe main takeaway from this book?\nDreams and tampering with evidence aside, innocent people will get convicted again and again \u2013 not only because our police and justice system is \n nor \n, but also because \n.\nAnd we need to both accept that \n work against it as well.\nAs far as cases such as these are concerned, the Innocence Project is a great start. \nClick \n to find out more.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Innocent Man Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nis \u201ca gritty, harrowing, true-crime story\u201d that should serve to remind everybody that, as opposed to novels, in reality, justice often goes astray.\nIn real life, policemen and detectives are not superheroes, but ordinary people who can not only make mistakes but who can also, sometimes, even \n ignore the facts so as to add another solved crime to their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.\nis a great reminder that this can sometimes lead to the death of an innocent man; and, as we learned from John Donne and Hemingway, the death of every innocent man on this planet is \n responsibility.\n\n"},

Let\u2019s go?\nThe Goal Summary\nEliyahu M. Goldratt was a physics student in Israel in the 1970s. There he developed a mathematical theory for industries to plan their production optimally. The theory became known as OPT (Optimized Production Technology).\nAfter completing his studies, Goldratt devoted himself to putting his theory into practice in the marketplace in real companies, and in the 1980s he expanded this theory by formulating the so-called Restriction Theory.\nThe theory of constraints reveals that in order to maximize a firm\u2019s productive capacity, it is necessary to create mechanisms that assess how production line decisions affect profits.\nNot always the volume of profits of a company is directly associated with its efficiency.\nBeing productive means being closer to the expected result of the goal. Any action that brings the company closer to its goal is therefore productive. To measure a company\u2019s performance, you need to use financial metrics.\nThe Company Goal\nA for-profit company should seek present and \n. Unlike previous thought currents, Goldratt believes that profitability does not conflict with the company\u2019s mission and vision.\nProfitability ensures that the company can grow and become sustainable to stay in the market and that is what enables the company\u2019s mission to be realized.\nThe survival of a company derives from its ability to generate value and profits and this is done when its products and services \n.\nConsumer needs for quality and functionality need to be met for the company to continue growing.\nWelcome To The Unique Manufacturing World\nAlex Rogo is the manager of a UniCo manufacturing plant. Its factory is running the risk of being closed by the UniCo directors. The factory is failing to deliver the products consumers want, and this brings permanent losses.\nProduction is lagging behind, employees are trying to catch up by working overtime, and \n. Combined delays, worn out employees and overtime cost prevent the factory from generating money.\nWithout alternatives, Rogo seeks outside help. He hires a consultant named Jonah, to find improvement opportunities and save the factory.\nPlaying Catch Up\nAs the manufacturing and customer orders delivery is late, Jonah needs to reduce the time between the order made by a customer and the delivery of the product.\nTo reduce this time, called lead time, from a few months to a few weeks, Jonah goes on to try to understand what may be stopping the factory from becoming profitable.\nHe realizes that although the factory is not generating money, it has teams that \n.\nTeams that had independent goals and were responsible for some steps in the process were succeeding.\nBecause teams work together in the factory, a high-productivity team that hits the finish line at the right cost and ends up generating more inputs for other teams, which ended up stopping the manufacturing process.\nThat makes it clear to Rogo and Jonah that the high productivity of a team is not necessarily a good thing for the plant as a whole.\nThe integration of the teams functions as a pipeline where a constant flow of activities occurs. If a team cannot keep up with another team\u2019s performance, it becomes a bottleneck for the company and this pipeline flow capacity decreases.\nProducts stand still in the middle of the process, the inventory grows unnecessarily, and resources invested by the company come to a standstill. Rogo\u2019s factory, for example, bought raw materials at high speed to keep up with the first team.\nHowever, the company was unable to deliver the products because many incomplete products would stand still after the first stage completion.\nTwo Types Of Resources\nThere are 2 types of resources in a factory:\nAlex Rogo implemented a change by understanding the two types of resources. The company\u2019s processes need to be aligned with \n of generating profits, and the teams need to change focus.\nWhen the highly productive team delivers more than the production line can absorb, resources stand idle, and the company\u2019s overall goal is undermined.\n \n    (function(d,id){\n\n      if(d.getElementById(id))return;\n\n      var scr=d.createElement('script');scr.src='https://widget.\n.com/v0.2.0/widget.js';scr.id=id;d.body.appendChild(scr);})(document,'12min-widget-sdk');\n\n    \nSo the first task is to identify the company goal (make the plant profitable) and have all teams work toward the same goal.\nIf a team does a local performance optimization and this goal does not help the company achieve its goal, this is not a positive optimization.\nCompany Goal Components\nTogether, Jonah, Alex, and his team set out to identify how to improve their production process. To reach the financial goal, they discovered that there are 3 tasks to be accomplished:\nBy acting on these 3 components, the factory could then reach profitability and the indicator to be tracked is net profit. It is measured by the difference between earnings, defined as sales revenues less operating expenses and inventory costs.\nNet income reflects how much money the company is generating at any given time.\nAnother important indicator of being monitored is the \n. It exists to measure the effort required to achieve predefined profitability.\nTo know your return on investment, you must divide the net profit by the inventory, that is, all the money that the company invests in the purchase of things that it intends to sell.\nIdentifying Bottlenecks\nAlex Rogo and Jonah then left to identify the company bottlenecks, the stages of the production line where the process stopped.\nOnce there are 2 teams causing bottlenecks, they impact the entire factory to produce at the slower bottleneck speed.\nThus, employees would only work if it was possible to deliver the product to the customer at the factory speed. When work generates inputs that are not going to be used, what actually occurs is a waste and is not advantageous to the company.\nBy optimizing the factory bottleneck processes, they realized that it was not necessary to focus on the processes that worked.\nIf the \n is on the bottleneck, it\u2019s easy to increase factory productivity. Any effort in non-mitigating processes did not produce results.\nThese teams did not need the pressure, overtime or \n, after all, any gain about them did not help the company\u2019s performance.\nEven the purchase of computers and robots to improve processes without bottlenecks was useless and mere waste.\nMarket\u2019s Bottleneck\nWith factory speed improving, the team can deliver products to the market in a timely manner. On the other hand, a new problem arises.\nThere is not so much demand to buy the products created by the factory\u2019s high production capacity.\nWhen capacity is greater than demand, problems arise. Ready-made products get stuck in inventory, and that means stationary money, which detracts from the goal.\nThat\u2019s why Alex\u2019s new priority is to align factory capacity with market demands.\nThe factory needs to be pulled from the market so that what it produces costs as little as possible to generate more gains. When the process is pulled from the market, there is no waste.\nAdopting Continuous Improvement\nTo stay competitive, UniCo needs to reduce lead time, costs to deliver the product and thus ensure that the plant is profitable.\nThe easiest way to keep the plant efficiency is adopting a method of continuous improvement so that as time goes by the factory becomes \n.\nThe process of continuous improvement consists of 5 main steps:\nThrough continuous improvement, Alex and his team can reduce lead time, reduce costs and prove their method to top management so they can save the plant.\nThis turnaround allowed Rogo, previously tired and stressed, to be promoted and invited to apply his apprenticeships in all UniCo factories.\n?\u00a0We\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free\u00a0\n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nThe Goal Quotes\nFinal Notes\nIn a company, it is important that work is organized to identify bottlenecks. Once identified, we must focus entirely on solving it and even adjusting other processes to operate according to their capacity.\nAll this can be achieved through a process of continuous improvement, always monitored and optimized to align the company more and more with the market demand."},

They are perfect for those who want to save more too.\nThe next three steps are a deepening the\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey provide useful advice from\u00a0those who succeeded to tame the Wall Street jungle; examples of people who have succeeded \u2013 and their example\u00a0will motivate you;\u00a0ideas about how you could make a balance between risk and income; how you should calculate your investments and how to apply tax to get the maximum possible profits for life.\nThe first step is the main and simplest of all. Determine how much you want to invest and save.\nIndependence and financial freedom begin there. Although simple, though, the decision can cause a sense of loss, of lifestyle loss.\nThe feeling of \u201cif I save money, I will not live too\u201d is real, but it should not be decisive when choosing how much to keep and invest.\nIt is important to think that in the next 25 or 30 years the human life expectancy may exceed 100 years. If financial life is hard now, imagine having to plan to save money and retire with all that time ahead.\nIt is for information like life expectancy that planning should begin as soon as possible.\nAnd another important point is not to depend on or expect too much from traditional retirement. Retirements, as we know them today, may not even exist in the not too distant future.\nIt is not to despair and to think that it will be necessary to work until you die. The important thing is to wake up to reality and rethink some of the myths that have always been told about financial security throughout life, such as:\nIf you believe working for 40 years will guarantee your financial freedom for another 40 years, it\u2019s time to think better about what you believe.\nThe return of a traditional retirement is not worth from the investment point of view. It impoverishes you over time. So, briefly, the lesson is:\nYour future is in your hands.\n(function(d,id){if(d.getElementById(id))return;var scr=d.createElement(\u2018script\u2019);scr.src=\u2019https://widget.\n.com/v0.2.0/widget.js\u2019;scr.id=id;d.body.appendChild(scr);})(document,\u201912min-widget-sdk\u2019);window.twelveminInit=function twelveminInit(){};\n\nLike it or not, you need to economize and invest your money aggressively. Is this a fun mission?\nNo. Sexy? Even less. You would probably like to buy a wonderful house, a new car and sport a lifestyle out there. But this is not the way to long-term success.\nSaving and investing aggressively is not cool, fun or sexy, but it helps you sleep more peaceful evenings. You owe it to yourself and your family. It\u2019s a matter of protection to try to prepare for eventual storms throughout life.\nThink of the investment market, pensions, and social security plans as a game. As a strategy game, you need to know how to use the right cards, make the most assertive moves, and plan your victory well.\nThe top tips to feel more prepared and properly safe before even entering the investment world:\nTrue financial success comes in levels. In 5 levels, to be more exact:\nTo follow this path you need to decide what stage of it you intend to reach.\nSome people seek an extremely luxurious life, which is a perfectly normal desire. Others, however, prefer a simple yet comfortable life.\nNone of the alternatives is certain since the concept of right and wrong is not applicable in such cases. It is only your decision.\nRegardless of the level of financial success you desire, 5 strategies will guide the process and accelerate your personal progress:\nThe experts (read: billionaires) agree on this point. Asset allocation is the key to successful investment and the only way to truly diversify your portfolio.\n\u201cBut I diversify my portfolio,\u201d you say. \u201cI invest my money in an S&P index.\u201d\nThat\u2019s great! But what if the stock market is crap?You\u2019re screwed.\nAsset allocation goes beyond simply owning a lot of stock.\nAsset Allocation is about owning a lot of unrelated asset classes: domestic stocks, international stocks, emerging market stocks, bonds, real estate, Treasuries, commodities, etc. It\u2019s about putting your money in different buckets.\nThat way, if one of your buckets spills a leak, you do not lose everything.\nAs the topic itself already says, the main point of step five is to create a source of lifetime income. The strategy for this is simple:\nTo convert your money and render into a lifetime source of income, you need first to accumulate wealth. To help with this, Tony shares the \u201cAll Seasons\u201d strategy developed by legendary investor Ray Dalio.\nAccording to Dalio, there are four economic \u201cstations\u201d that move asset prices: inflation, deflation, growing economic growth, and declining economic growth. As such, different assets work well at different stations.\nConsidering that no one knows what the future holds, Dalio suggests that investors invest their assets to benefit equally from each economic season or \u201cseason\u201d: 25% for inflation, 25% for deflation, 25% for economic growth and 25% for the decline of economic growth.\nImagine how you would feel if you knew that you would never run out of money. That\u2019s right, for the rest of my life. Although it sounds too good to be true, there are some ways to convert your accumulated wealth into a lifelong source of income.\nAs Dr. Jeffrey R. Brown, a professor of finance at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, wrote in his paper Paycheck for Life: The Role of Annuities in Your Retirement Portfolio:\nSimply put, if an individual accumulates enough wealth to cover the difference between their monthly income and their necessary expenses, then the retiree is free to invest and spend the rest of the portfolio however he desires, knowing that basic needs are covered no matter how long he/she lives.\nIn other words, if you can accumulate enough wealth, you can simply make money every month until you die. You can not worry about how you will make money when you are 90 years old.\nThink about whether it does not seem much more fun to make money without working at age 90 while playing a game of checkers. Much more than working in a supermarket at this age, right?\nTony interviewed some millionaires and billionaires for the creation of this book. From these interviews, Tony synthesized four principles that united all of them together:\nIn the end, MONEY: Master the game is not about money. It\u2019s about living your best life. Money is simply a tool to help you do this.\nEven if you do not have there a large amount of money, the future still looks bright. As technology advances, more products, services, and experiences will be available to more and more people leveling the field between those who have and those who have no money.\nToday, we have everything in our hands. Using a smartphone, we can access the sum of all human knowledge in a matter of seconds. We can ride our mechanical horse to a building filled with an unlimited source of fresh food.\nWe can use specialized 3D printers to print new body parts for people who need them.\nWho knows what the future will bring? The only thing we can say with certainty is that human potential is virtually unlimited.\nTony Robbins makes a call for planning every move and programming a \u201cdream bucket\u201d to bring automated income over an unlimited period of time\u00a0\u2013\u00a0your lifetime.\nThe last step is a \n \u2013\nAfter the plan is well established it is very important to take action and to put all of it into practice. But everything we do we have to do with a passion to achieve the desired result with pleasure and ease.\nAt this point, we can see the spiritual side of man.\nThe author urges us not to run after money:\nFor \n in life and to be sure that happiness will always accompany us, we should not neglect the other matters of our personal life. And by these Tony Robins means health, relationships, and\u00a0family because \nAt the end of the book, he uses his skills of a\u00a0\n and reminds us how the decisions we make can influence our good or bad mood, our reactions and last our vision of life.\nThis book seems to be divided into two parts, one is of \n\u00a0\n\u00a0that can sustain the lifestyle chosen by each of us, and the second is about \n to search our self-fulfillment\n.\nAt first glance, this may seem like a paradox in which the author succeeds to balance very well but not subtly these two worlds: material fulfillment and self-fulfillment.\nEven if\u00a0you see the financial issue as a chess game or as a gamble, after reading this book you won\u2019t have to\u00a0struggle to figure out what\u2019s the best for you:\u00a0to save and invest or to share\u00a0the material goods with those who lack them?\nFinal Notes:\nAt the end of our lives, it does not matter how much money we make over it, how we diversify our portfolio, or how often we beat the market. What is important is how you have improved the world around you.\nAs Tony writes near the end of the book, \u201cBeing the richest man in the graveyard is not the goal.\u201d Instead, the goal is to live a meaningful life, whatever that means to you. For most of us, this means giving your time, energy and money to others.\nGiving to others puts things in perspective. When you give to others, you realize that you have something to give. When you give to others, you realize that your life is not that bad.\nSo start giving your time, energy and money to others and start living a prosperous life today.\nHow about starting right now?"},

I\u2019m Not Sure If It\u2019s for You, But\n2. Open-Minded\n3. What Do You Know?\n4. How Would You Feel If?\n5. Just Imagine\n6. When Would Be a Good Time?\n7.

Just One More Thing\n22. A Favor\n23. Just Out of Curiosity\nI\u2019m Not Sure If It\u2019s for You, But\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s for you, but\u2026\u201d is the best way to introduce any idea to anyone.\nWhy?\nBecause, at a subconscious level, the listener translates it to \u201cThere\u2019s no pressure here\u2026 Why don\u2019t you have a look at this.\u201d\n\u2022 I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s for you, but this option is available for this week only, and I would hate for you to miss out.\n\u2022 I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s for you, but we have plans on Sunday, and, if you\u2019d like, you\u2019re welcome to \n.\n(Here and elsewhere below, almost all of the examples are taken straight from the book \u2013 possibly with some minor changes here and there.)\nOpen-Minded\nAs we said above, your subconscious works only along the lines of a \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno;\u201d and since there\u2019s no \u201cmaybe,\u201d if you ask a group of 1,000 people whether they consider themselves open-minded, at least 90% of them would answer in the affirmative.\nWhy?\nBecause the alternative \u2013 \u201cclosed-minded\u201d \u2013 sounds very, very bad.\nUse this to your benefit \u2013 if you start a sentence with \u201chow open-minded\u201d you\u2019re shifting the odds of your listener agreeing with you from 50/50 to 90/10.\n\u2022 How open-minded would you be about trying this as an alternative?\n\u2022 Would you be open-minded about seeing if we could work together?\nWhat Do You Know?\nAll people think they know best \u2013 that\u2019s how we\u2019re built to think. And if you want to steer a conversation in a certain direction, you have to have control over it.\nA great way to achieve this is by moving the other person\u2019s position \u201cfrom one of certainty to one of doubt.\u201d\nHence the \u201cwhat do you know?\u201d magic phrase. And now you see why \n.\n\u2022 What do you know about everything that has changed since (insert event)?\n\u2022 What do you know about how things really work here?\nHow Would You Feel If?\nWe know for sure that people work a lot harder to avoid potential losses than to achieve a potential gain; simply put, nothing motivates us more than losing what we already own.\nTo overcome this obstacle \u2013 or, even better, to use it to your benefit \u2013 paint for your listener a future scenario so that you can trigger in him the proper emotions.\n\u2022 How would you feel if your competition passed you? (\n \n)\n\u2022 How would you feel if this decision led to your promotion? (\n)\nJust Imagine\nFor better or for worse, we are \n; consequently, storytelling will always have the power to inspire, influence, and persuade.\nWhy?\nBecause it creates pictures in the minds of others and because we are wired to just sit back and enjoy the view in situations such as these.\nWhen you were a child, the magic words were \u201cOnce upon a time\u2026;\u201d the adult formula is \u201cJust imagine.\u201d\n\u2022 Just imagine how things will be in six months\u2019 time once you have implemented this.\n\u2022 Just imagine the look on your kids\u2019 faces when they see you achieve this.\nWhen Would Be a Good Time?\nOne of the biggest challenges of the 21\n century is finding the time \u2013 you for the others, the others for you.\nHowever, unless you inspire someone to make a room in his life for your ideas, you\u2019ll never sell your idea, will you?\nA good way to do this is by using the phrase \u201cwhen would be a good time?\u201d\nThis magic expression implies that there \n be some good time and incites the listener to tell you \n will that time be.\n\u2022 When would be a good time for you to take a proper look at this?\n\u2022 When would be a good time to get started?\nI\u2019m Guessing You Haven\u2019t Got Around To\nThis has probably happened to everyone at least once: someone promises that he/she will do something and yet he/she hasn\u2019t after a certain period of time.\nYou know full well that you may ruin things if you\u2019re aggressive, and yet you want to give the person of interest a nudge.\nHow should you do it?\nBy pushing for the negative scenario! \nIt\u2019s the other person\u2019s turn to fix it.\n\u2022 I\u2019m guessing you haven\u2019t got around to looking over the documents yet?\n\u2022 I\u2019m guessing you haven\u2019t got around to making a decision yet?\nSimple Swaps\nSometimes, just changing one or two words can make all the difference.\nFor example, swapping the slogan \u201cI\u2019m blind: would you give me some money?\u201d with \u201cIt\u2019s a sunny day, but I can\u2019t see it\u2026\u201d has yielded more than positive results.\nYou do the same.\nFor example, instead of asking your audience \u201cDo you have any questions?\u201d ask them \u201cWhat questions do you have for me?\u201d\nThat way, you\u2019re in control.\nYou Have Three Options\n, we are notoriously susceptible to being fooled by both our emotions and our reason.\nAlso, we tend to suffer from something called analysis paralysis when we have to choose from a number of options.\nA good way to take control over situations such as these is by offering only three options; afterward, just ask the other person \u201cOf those three options, what\u2019s going to be easier for you?\u201d\nThat\u2019s a magic word combo!\nTwo Types of People\nIf you want to prompt a near-instant decision, then frame the options within the \u201ctwo types of people\u201d narrative.\n\u201cThe second someone hears, \u2018There are two types of people in this world,\u2019\u201d writes Jones, \u201cthe little voice in their head immediately wonders which one they are, and they wait with bated breath to hear the choices.\u201d\n\u2022 There are two types of people in this world: those who leave their personal financial success in the hands of their employers and those who take full responsibility and build their own futures.\n\u2022 There are two types of people in this world: those who resist change in favor of nostalgia and those who move with the times and create a better future.\nI Bet You\u2019re a Bit Like Me\nThe reason why you can\u2019t convince strangers to do anything is that they are \n: we are evolutionarily preprogrammed not to trust people who are unlike us.\nThe tweak?\nJust say \u201cI bet you\u2019re a bit like me\u201d whenever you want to furnish a closer connection to the other person.\n\u2022 I bet you\u2019re a bit like me: you enjoy working hard now, knowing that it will pay dividends in the future.\n\u2022 I bet you\u2019re a bit like me: you\u2019re a busy person who\u2019s always juggling to get everything done.\nIf\u2026 Then\nYou remember the \u201cif\u2026 then\u201d sandwich from your childhood: \n\u201cIf you don\u2019t tidy your room, then you\u2019re going to be grounded for the weekend.\u201d\nOr, even more universal:\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t eat all your dinner, then you\u2019re not going to get any dessert.\u201d\nIt worked, didn\u2019t it?\nWell, now it\u2019s your turn to act like your mother; ok, a bit like her.\n\u2022 If you decide to give this a try, then I promise you won\u2019t be disappointed.\n\u2022 If you give me a chance in the role, then I am confident you will thank me later.\nDon\u2019t Worry\nThe best way to deal with a high-stress scenario?\nJust convince the other person that nothing\u2019s out of the order at the moment and that you have everything under control.\nYou need no more than two words to do this:\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\u2022 Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re bound to be nervous right now.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t worry. I felt just the way you feel right now before I started, and look at me now.\nMost People\nYou know what most people are afraid of?\nBeing the outcasts, the recluses, the castaways; in a nutshell: being \n most people.\nThat\u2019s why you can get the attention of \n people by simply telling them that what you need from them is precisely what most people would do.\nMost people should follow.\n\u2022 What most people do is complete the forms with me here today. You then receive your welcome pack, and we get you booked in for a launch.\n\u2022 Most people in your circumstances would grab this opportunity with both hands, knowing that there is almost no risk.\nThe Good News\nThis one you know from practically every second film: even if the good news follows after the worst news, they always tend to bring some relief.\nThe formula is even more powerful if there is no bad news.\nEverybody wants some positivity in his/her life, and \u201cThe good news is\u2026\u201d is the magic word to infuse it!\nWhat Happens Next\nSometimes, no matter how hard you try, conversations may come to a halt due to the indecisiveness of your talking partner.\nThe thing to remember for situations such as this is simple: \u201cthe easier the question, the easier you gain your decision.\u201d\nSo, make the next step by saying something along the lines of \u201cWhat happens next is we\u2019ll try to fill out your details; speaking of: In terms of registering your details, what is the best address for you?\u201d\nWhat Makes You Say That?\nSometimes \u2013 or, let\u2019s face it: oftentimes \u2013 you\u2019ll face not only indecisiveness but also objections and protests.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got the time now,\u201d \u201cI would, but I don\u2019t have the money,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure your idea is great, but I\u2019ve heard many better ideas,\u201d etc.\nThe worst thing you could do in situations such as this is to respond with a counterargument; the best thing: be inquisitive.\n\u2022 The customer says, \u201cI need to speak to somebody else before I make a decision about this.\u201d You say, \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d\n\u2022 The customer says, \u201cReally, I don\u2019t have all the money right now.\u201d You say, \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d\nBefore You Make Your Mind Up\nMoving from a \u201cno\u201d to a \u201cyes\u201d is all but impossible; however, moving from a \u201cno\u201d to a \u201cmaybe\u201d and from a \u201cmaybe\u201d to a \u201cyes\u201d is conceivable.\nThe best way to make a step in the right direction concerning the first section of this two-part journey is by using the magic word \u201cbefore you make your mind up.\u201d\nIt inspires the other person to rethink his/her decision \u2013 and, in many cases, he/she will.\n\u2022 Look, before you make your mind up, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019ve looked at all the facts.\n\u2022 Before you make your mind up, wouldn\u2019t it make sense to speak to a few more people about the difference this could make for you and your family?\nIf I Can, Will You?\nSometimes, the objections coming from the other side are a list of reasons why the thing you want to is unlikely to happen.\n\u201cYou have the power in these situations,\u201d says Jones, \u201cto remove the barrier by responding with a powerful question that eliminates the other person\u2019s argument.\u201d\nAnd that question is: \u201cIf I can\u2026 will you?\u201d\n\u2022 If I can pick you up and drop you off at home, then will you be able to be ready for seven pm?\n\u2022 If I can match that price for you, then would you be happy to place the order with me today?\nEnough\nInfluencing other people\u2019s decision is all about making it easier for them to decide \u2013 of course, in a way which suits you best.\nFor example, if you are in a grocery store unable to choose between buying four or eight apples and the seller asks you \u201cWould six apples be enough for you?\u201d you\u2019ll probably answer \u201cyes\u201d because of the presence of that \n.\nSuddenly \u2013 four apples seem too few.\nJust One More Thing\nAccording to Phil M.

And Why?\nWho wouldn\u2019t want to become a millionaire?\nWell, probably there are some who are not interested in it, but in general, people have this natural inclination to improve their status.\nAfter conducting all-inclusive research, Dean was able to deliver a comprehensive blueprint which depicts the habits that are cultivated by millionaires.\nAbout Dean Graziosi\n is a writer, entrepreneur and the founder of Motor Millions.\nSo far, he has written four books:\n \u201cMillionaire Success Habits PDF Summary\u201d\nApparently, Dean exerts himself to find the million-dollar formula, mostly by placing emphasis on empirical data, analysis, and research. \nOn top of that, he gives a critical review of what could be a game-changer in the following years. \nProductivity, the much-vaunted element in today\u2019s society is receiving a hard blow.\nWhile on the topic, Dean points out that productivity and wages are not going up proportionally, and we need to find out why.\nThe 45-degree slope in the sketch is definitely a blow to the believers in the \u201chard-working\u201d philosophy.\nWhat does this discovery reveal?\nIt literally means that we get many things done, but that doesn\u2019t reflect on wages and working conditions.\nIt seems as if the middle-class is being pushed aside, and squeezed out of society.\nAnd yes, \n.\nBeing wealthy or acquiring wealth should not be regarded as some dirty business. People these days, have this natural disgust for rich folks because they reckon that filling one\u2019s pockets can only be done at the expense of others.\nDon\u2019t forget that being rich, or just getting to the middle class can make a lot of difference. Truthfully, it\u2019s not the only antidote, but it shouldn\u2019t be discarded that easily as well.\nSimply put \u2013 regardless of how you perceive the money-making world, this is the best time for getting your hands onto the things you crave for. \nMillionaires employ thousands of people, and their contribution to the economy is by no means superficial. \nThe social dogma permeating today\u2019s society suggests that millionaires and money, in general, are evil concepts. But, it\u2019s proven that a little bit of extra money can make your life a whole lot easier.\nSo why all the hate?\nBecause we have abandoned the wheel! We have left behind the world of achievement and productivity, and made a U-turn.\nAnd what\u2019s worse, we have no idea where are we headed to. \nIt\u2019s like a drunkard roaming around, purposelessly.\nMost of the time, we hear people complaining about the lack of time and the inability to improve their \n. \nThe problem is not in the dearth of time, but having ill-defined goals or not having any whatsoever. \nWhen you are put in this bubble, there\u2019s very little you can do to improve your status. Not that the world doesn\u2019t give you opportunities, but because you have no clear vision of how you would like to structure your life.\nWe\u2019ve heard it like a million times that setting goals is the backbone of success, but many of us seem to skip this step.\nSo, with that said, here\u2019s the typical goal-setting process:\nIf you consider all of the elements, you\u2019ll definitely see signs of improvements in next to no time. \nNow you are good to go!\nWith that figured out, now it\u2019s time to face your worst enemy.\nSelf-doubt probably takes the pedestal, and it\u2019s almost always concealed and sneaky. In other words, it\u2019s hard to spot by any stretch of the imagination. \nThe inner voice that constantly keeps telling you that you are not good enough has taken a toll on your progress.\nAs an illustration, let\u2019s do the following scenario:\nYou have two wolves living inside you. One of them is greedy, malevolent, and needy. The other one is emphatic, compassionate, loving and positive.\nThey are constantly at each other\u2019s throats, battling for influence.\nSo, which one of these wolves will survive and win the fight?\nObviously, the one you feed with your attention and energy. As you might have guessed the villain is brought to life by you and the concepts you believe in \u2013 basically your past.\nThe negativity we talk about is the main culprit with regards to wars, terrorism, corruption; you name it. \nIt\u2019s the other wolf that sparks all the conflict in the world and sets things on fire.\nThe self-made villain thrives when you put energy into things that are superficial in its essence. It tends to remind you about your doubts, weaknesses and keep you docile.\nIt may come as a shock to you, but there\u2019s only a small percentage of people who can withstand this pressure and get things rolling on the right foot.\nDean even declares:\nWith that said, we kind of get this itchy feeling that society doesn\u2019t want you to prosper.\nMany people, probably even you at some point in their lives had an awesome idea. The Eureka moment was brought to its knees by those who we regard as our closest circle. Deliberately or not, our dreams were shattered by the voice of mediocrity.\nAs you can see, bad advice is literally the costliest thing on the market, and yes we are getting piles of it.\nIn order to fight off this tendency, you must be on full alert 24/7 for things that could impede your rise to the top.\nAnother thing you need to be wary of is to never take advice from people who have failed in accomplishing the thing you would like to excel at.\nIt\u2019s just common sense, and yet many people are hurting themselves by doing otherwise.\nWhen you jump on the latest bandwagon and follow the same logic as a society, you\u2019re not paving the way for glory.\nIn today\u2019s world, it\u2019s so hard to be yourself, that we almost made it a crime.\nPeople are taught to blend in, and never deviate from the known.\nWords, uttered or not can cause a lot of damage, and that\u2019s why you have to be so careful. You ought to choose them carefully, and dis-empower the negative connotation that floats with them.\nSo, how can you win this game?\nBy awakening the inner hero that\u2019s already inside you.\nWithout confidence, you\u2019ll never take the right action, and without action, you cannot achieve results. Some believe that being a hero requires admiration or supporters, but NO! \nNot being someone else\u2019s hero, but one to yourself.\nWhenever you allow the inner hero to take the driver\u2019s seat, you are much more likely to experience success on all fronts.\nThe solution-focused mentality is what drives the winners, and it\u2019s precisely the thing that your inner villain despises.\nThe strangest thing is \u2013 you either have a lot of confidence or close to none.\nLike, there\u2019s no middle ground whatsoever!\nThe hero is not a pompous jerk, who pretends to know everything about anything. It\u2019s a dedicated, goal-oriented driving-force that opposes the negative mindset which is omnipresent.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the 4 C\u2019s of confidence:\nThere\u2019s one simple exercise that could help you \n.\nIt\u2019s the process of telling yourself \u2013 \n. \nIf you can pluck up your courage, in the worst moments of your life, you can literally win over anything.\nIt\u2019s not so much about saying it, as it is about believing in it and having that determination to get past this phase no matter what.\nAll of a sudden, the sky will open up, and you\u2019ll be free of those limiting concepts.\nWhen it comes to adopting the right habits, Dean shares a glimpse of his 25-year entrepreneurial journey and shows what predicts success in the workplace.\nThe first thing is to be passionate about what you do.\nNext, list your money goals.\nAnd last but not least, take a moment to delve into how you can achieve those goals.\nBad habits can be replaced or changed when you can identify them. \nThat\u2019s why there are no entrepreneurs who hate what they do. You\u2019ll find them all fired up, ready to take the next step and seize the day.\nObviously, there\u2019s no such thing as a money-making machine, and you should not lean on it.\nAnd yes, even at the top you\u2019ll face challenges and dangers, but it\u2019s all part of the growth curve.\nNow, you\u2019ve identified the opportunities disguised as obstacles, so now what do we do?\nIt\u2019s now the right time to think about time management.\nIf you can allocate your time and efforts effectively, you\u2019ll be able to get more things done.\nIn the quest for money and success, we often forget about the crucial ingredients: attraction and persuasion. \nKey Lessons from \u201cMillionaire Success Habits\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Make things happen\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There\u2019s no tomorrow\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Find your \u201cWhy\u201d\nMake things happen\nSitting and scratching your head over problems won\u2019t make them disappear. \nIt\u2019s of utmost importance to stand up, diagnose the situation, and take appropriate follow-up actions. \nMost of the time, we would rather take the passive approach, and watch it from the side.\nTruthfully, you must be decisive in your execution!\nThere\u2019s no tomorrow\nStop with the procrastination once and for all.\nIt\u2019s time to understand that miracles happen in the \u201cNow\u201d and never in the later.\nSo, tackle the destructive thoughts that keep telling you otherwise.\nFind your \u201cWhy\u201d\nThe analogy behind this lesson indicates that without knowing your bearings, you will get lost.\nSo, stop roaming around, and define your purpose.\nBy doing so, you\u2019ll get the wind at your back to do all the things that should be doing.\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free \n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cMillionaire Success Habits Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nIt can be said with utmost confidence that millionaires share the same or at least similar habits when it comes to execution.\nOne of the things that bonds all of them is being passionate; another thing is decisiveness.\nThose two combined could really help you stand out from the crowd and make an impact."},

(By the way, he was probably a misogynist.)\nWell, business is no different than literary studies: if you want to attract an audience, you need to choose a niche and develop your skills in that direction.\nThe Venn diagram below should help you choose your expert niche:\nAs you can see from the image, it\u2019s not all passion and perseverance: you have to find a way to combine these with the needs of the market.\nIn other words, you\u2019ll be stuck with a hobby which you won\u2019t be able to ever monetize unless you find a marketplace for your ideas and passions.\nOr, in Meera Kothand\u2019s words:\nNow, what\u2019s a hungry market, you ask?\nIt\u2019s the market in the direction of which the money is flowing.\nSo, in a nutshell, if you notice that someone is paying money for a product or a service and you have some idea, knowledge, interest in these products or services \u2013 then, go for it!\nThat\u2019s your niche.\nYour expert niche.\nContent: Staking Claim to Your Expert Status with Knowledge\nStaking claim to your expert status is all about knowledge; and knowledge \u2013 in the online world \u2013 is all about creating and curating valuable content.\nThe first thing you need to learn: value is \n \u201cmassive free guides, downloads, lengthy how-to content, and tutorials.\u201d\nIt is more than that:\nChanging perception and mindsets? Adding to the body of literature in the niche?\nConsidering the fact that there are probably hundreds of articles on any given topic already, this is practically impossible!\nIt is not, says Meera.\nShe agrees that \u201cnothing is original\u201d and that \u201cpretty much everything has been done.\u201d However, she also suggests that you need to start thinking in terms of differentiating instead of originality: \u201cThe idea is not to be radically original,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe idea is to differentiate yourself.\u201d\nAccording to Meera, there are three characteristics of content which are universally deemed valuable; she calls them content levers and thinks that each one of your articles should be definable along their lines.\nSo, in other words, your article will be valuable if it:\n: myths are there to be broken, and experts are, more often than not, MythBusters; question the sacred cows in your niche;\n: don\u2019t muddle things up; even if polarizing (maybe even: \n then) be as clear as you can be; however, if you don\u2019t have arguments, be aware that you\u2019re doing nothing more than ranting;\n: valuable articles answer questions everybody asks, and nobody has answered as clearly as expected.\nThese are the four types of articles \u201cthat work really well to claim expert status.\u201d Meera Kothand offers an example for each of them authored by her \u2013 and we think it\u2019s only just to \nThe marketing funnel includes no less and no more than five different types of people; it\u2019s your goal to transform the first type among them (strangers) into the last one (customers and brand advocates).\nAnd here\u2019s how you can do that:\nAs you can see yourself from the graph above, the middle of the marketing funnel may be its most important part, aka it\u2019s most difficult to turn a stranger into a reader/subscriber.\nAfterward, it\u2019s far easier to convert a subscriber into an engaged subscriber/customer.\nSo, don\u2019t rush to the bottom of the funnel.\nBe careful and make your progress toward your brand advocates step-by-step: slowly, but surely.\nAuthority: Leveraging the Authority Architecture\nMeera Kothand defines authority as \u201cthe ability to get others to listen to you.\u201d\nOf course, everybody has the dream of achieving something of that sort, but not everybody is capable to; especially if you\u2019re starting from scratch, this may seem as not merely difficult, but all but unattainable.\nHowever, Kothand believes that you can do it!\nOnce again, you need to go slowly, and step by step.\nTo get featured on authority sites and podcast (aka, to borrow authority), you just need to follow these simple seven steps:\nThis should be easy: just make a list of sites/podcasts you want to be featured in.\nSee\nhow many of these sites are still active and have recent posts; find out whether they have a large audience; eliminate those who don\u2019t.\nKeep a running list of the remaining sites, featuring this information: URL, link to guest posting guidelines and the name and email of the one you should send your pitch to; then prioritize the sites based on their followers and difficulty to have your guest post published.\nThis is the most important part: create valuable tailor-made content the sites would wish to publish.\nShare their content on social media or within your content; show off your expertise by commenting on their blogs or podcasts.\nSend an email: be concise and straight-to-the-point; show your familiarity with the host\u2019s work and make sure that your blog post adheres to the host\u2019s guidelines.\nAdd author bio and links to your site; create a custom \n for the audience of your host\u2019s site/podcasts.\nOf course, in addition to borrowing authority, you can also build one. A great way to do this is by solving a specific problem in your niche through a challenge.\nIf you don\u2019t know what a challenge is, here\u2019s Meera\u2019s definition:\nOnce again, if you want to be successful, just follow these seven simple (and self-explanatory) steps:\nIn addition to a challenge, you can also try to create \n content (live coaching, live transformations, quizzes, and assessments), consider using HARO (help a reporter out) or even self-publish your own book.\nNeither is difficult, and they all get you a ton of authority points!\nMarketability: Marketing Your Expertise and Building a Marketing Campaign\n\u201cMarketing doesn\u2019t have to be about blowing your own trumpet,\u201d writes Meera Kothand. \nAnd then she goes on: \u201cThere are several subtle ways that you can market yourself and build your credibility as an expert. Because being seen as an expert is as much about your social proof and visibility as it is about the depth of knowledge you have.\u201d\nKothand offers many of them and, really you should have a look at them all \u2013 by her own admission, they are based on the principles that Robert Cialdini develops and analyzes in his ultra-popular book \nIf you don\u2019t remember them, these are reciprocity, commitment & consistency, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity.\nIf you want to develop an \u201cexpert online business\u201d marketing strategy based on these principles, then you should:\n\u2022 \n and tell Google how you want to be seen; yes, we\u2019re talking about meta-titles and meta-data, professional e-mail addresses and branded social presence;\n\u2022\nby doing away with stock images and cliched \u201cwhat\u2019s my mission\u201d statements; \n\u2022 \n by offering a free lead magnet (or opt-in incentive) that\u2019s related to your expertise and business model\n\u2022 \nor FOMO with social proof: be sure to make known the number of your followers in a banner; because 50 million Elvis fans can\u2019t be wrong, can they?\n\u2022 \n by showing authority markers or \u201cas seen in\u201d logos; and, finally\n\u2022 \nby asking your customers to execute some tiny, effortless actions.\nKey Lessons from \u201cBut I\u2019m Not an Expert\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Create Valuable Content and Conquer the Middle of the Marketing Funnel Like a Boss\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If It\u2019s More Difficult to Build Authority \u2013 Borrow Some\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Use Some Psychological Tricks to Market Your Expertise\nCreate Valuable Content and Conquer the Middle of the Marketing Funnel Like a Boss\nMany people head straight to the bottom of the funnel, aka selling stuff to customers so they can monetize their hobby.\nHowever, the point is to build a large audience first, because it\u2019s much easier to turn engaged subscribers (level 4 of the funnel) into customers and brand advocates (level 5) than it is to convert strangers (level 1) to casual readers and interested subscribers (level 2 and 3).\nAnd the way you do this?\nWhy, of course: by creating valuable, differentiated content.\nThe tips & tricks are above.\nIf It\u2019s More Difficult to Build Authority \u2013 Borrow Some\nYou can build authority by creating challenges and interactive content, but due to the sheer number of experts in any niche, this is far more difficult (no matter how knowledgeable you are) than simply borrowing authority.\nYes, we\u2019re talking about guest posts!\nOnce again, all you need is valuable content \u2013 tailored to your host\u2019s interests and audience.\nSo, what are you waiting for?\nUse Some Psychological Tricks to Market Your Expertise\nWe are all people, and \n.\nMeaning: \n, and, once you know them, you can use them to your benefit.\nBecoming an expert has never been easier.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m Not an Expert Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nis written as a sort of compendium of how-to manuals; in other words, almost all of its chapters and sections are applicable and can be put into practice immediately.\n\n"},

As was customary, after she moved in with Deepak\u2019s family, all her connections with her birth family were severed: now she was a member of her husband\u2019s household.\nOn their wedding night, both Amisha and Deepak are nervous \u2013 and we don\u2019t need to tell you the reason for that.\nHowever, as much as Amisha is nervous because of innocent reasons, Deepak feels that way because, well, he\u2019s going to get laid for the first time. \nAmisha notices his uneasiness and starts telling him a story so that she can decrease his stress and relax him; Amisha is a natural storyteller and, in a way, her plot works.\nBut, make no mistake: it\u2019s not like Deepak cares for Amisha\u2019s story or anything; it\u2019s not like he cares for her, as a matter of fact; to him, Amisha is merely a \n: she is just a woman, the woman who\u2019ll bear his children and wash the dishes.\nAnd, you know what? \nAmisha is supposed to be happy about all of this!\nAt least that\u2019s what \n, Deepak\u2019s mother, tells her: their family is well-regarded in the village, she says, and, let\u2019s face it, that\u2019s the most a woman can (and should) hope about.\nEventually, Amisha hires a servant: Ravi. \nThe problem?\nRavi is untouchable, member of the lowest caste.\nFortunately, despite Chara\u2019s protests, Deepak allows him to stay; Ravi remains eternally grateful and loves Amisha more than anything in the world.\nLearning English\nYears pass and \n sets up an English school in Amisha\u2019s village.\nAmisha, hopeful that she could be able to write her stories in English one day in the future, meets with the head of the school, a British officer named Stephen.\nStephen notices her desire and convinces her to start going to school; Amisha, however, too afraid of Deepak\u2019s reaction, quits after a single day.\nStephen would not have it: she goes over to her house and offers Amisha to become her personal tutor in English; in return, she would only need to teach the children at the local school creative writing.\nRavi convinces Amisha to accept; she does.\nIn Amisha proves to be a great teacher; she is especially adored by a teenage girl named \n, who is the most talented in her class; unsurprisingly, Amisha is reminded of herself every time she sets her eyes upon Neema.\nAnd every time she sets her eyes upon Stephen, she starts feeling some tingling in the area around her heart.\nAs the two grow closer and closer, it becomes rather obvious that Stephen feels much the same way about her.\nOne day, Amisha gifts Stephen a story about two brothers meeting each other in Heaven; Stephen is touched: his own brother had died in the war, and he\u2019s more than aware that this story was written specifically with him in mind.\nAmisha, in the meantime, realizes that a story by Neema is highly personal as well.\nIn it, a girl kills herself to avoid being forced into an arranged marriage; Amisha correctly deduces that Neema\u2019s hand is already promised and that she doesn\u2019t want to accept the inevitability of her fate.\nLove\u2026 and Everything That Comes With It\nOne day, while preparing the house for the inevitable hurricane, Ravi injures himself; however, since he\u2019s untouchable, no doctor in the city wants to have anything to do with his injury.\nAmisha, seeing no way out, runs to Stephen\u2019s house; Stephen takes Ravi to a military base where he is treated for his injury.\nStephen comes back from the base and reveals to Amisha that Ravi is fine; overcome with emotions, Amisha jumps in his arms and kisses him; Stephen returns the kiss; the third kiss is deep and passionate.\nNothing further happens, since Amisha is told in the meantime that one of her students tried to kill herself.\nYou get zero points for guessing that the student is none other than Neema; Amisha was right: inspired by her classes, Neema started feeling that the choice between death and loveless marriage is not as difficult as it may seem to some.\nAfter the story of Neema makes the rounds and reaches the ears of Deepak, he forbids Amisha to ever return to school.\nIt\u2019s a double blow for Amisha since this also spells the end of her meetings and discussions with Stephen; Ravi helps in relation to the latter: as soon as he recovers, he acts as a messenger between the two\nOne day, Amisha learns that Stephen has been reassigned to another post, away not only from her hometown but also from India. \nDistraught, she ignores all prohibitions and risks, and goes over to Stephen; the two finally make love.\nYup, that\u2019s when Lena was conceived; Jaya\u2019s grandfather was never called Deepak.\nThe Storyteller\u2019s Secret Epilogue\nLena\u2019s real grandfather never got to know her: Stephen left India in the meantime, and, a few years later, Amisha died, the victim of a fatal tropic disease contracted from a mosquito bite.\nDeepak remarried, and his new wife Omi didn\u2019t like Lena one bit; especially not after finding Amisha\u2019s love letters to Stephen.\nThe result?\nDeepak fires Ravi for allowing the affair to happen and starts neglecting Lena; no wonder she started neglecting her daughter as well: she was never loved enough to learn how to love.\nBack in the present, Ravi reveals to Lena that the secret of Amisha\u2019s relationship wasn\u2019t the only one she kept throughout the years.\nThere\u2019s an even bigger one, he says.\nNamely, Stephen came back for Amisha, stubbornly determined to take her with him and never look back; however, Ravi stopped him, telling him that it\u2019s for the best of both of them that things stay the way they are.\nJaya forgives Ravi: we\u2019ll never know if he made the right decision, but we\u2019ll always know that he did it with the best of intentions.\nSoon after, Jaya gets a phone call; it\u2019s none other than Patrick, telling her that he loves her and that he has made a mistake. \nWant proof?\nHe\u2019s in India, looking for her.\nThe two settle their differences and decide to adopt children; there are hints that these children may be Ravi\u2019s: \n and \n.\nRavi allows them to travel to London with Patrick and Jaya so that Misha can get polio treatment, something he\u2019s unable to in India.\nSoon after the four leave, Amisha\u2019s spirit appears to Ravi.\n\u201cYou did a good job,\u201d it says. \u201cNow, it\u2019s time to take some rest.\u201d\nRavi passes away.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Storyteller\u2019s Secret PDF Summary Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nis a touching story about love, loyalty, and self-discovery;

And Why?\nThe strange thing about this book is that it encompasses so many aspects of our daily lives.\nAmong other things, \n also puts in the spotlight the entrepreneurial fire and attitude nurtured by Chip and Joanna. \nAs a reader, you\u2019ll find what it takes to succeed in the real world, and how to deal with the challenges life throws at you!\nIf you are ready to face the music, then this book comes as a blessing in disguise. \nAbout Chip Gaines\n is the co-owner and co-founder of Magnolia Homes.\nHe earned his bachelor degree from Baylor University in marketing. People often say that he started more small businesses than you can count on your fingers.\nBut it would be imprudent not to mention his loving and combative wife \u2013 \n!\nAlongside her, he co-wrote \u201c\n.\u201d\n\u201cCapital Gaines PDF Summary\u201d\nIn the first chapter, Chip recaps his childhood and mentions that he was a normal kid, like everybody else. But, there is an unexplored mystery behind \u201cbeing normal\u201d so let\u2019s dive in!\nThe first-grade teachers in his school divided the class into four reading groups. \nAt that time, Chip didn\u2019t see anything strange in that; it was just a bunch of teams bearing cool names. \nHe doesn\u2019t remember everything, but he recalls that when it was his time to read, the rest of the kids were ushered out while he remained in the classroom.\nYou get the idea.\nPerhaps, some of the other kids made fun of him, but Chip looked at life through a set of rosy lens.\nWhen it was his time to hit the gym with the rest of his classmates, he didn\u2019t feel embarrassed but honored, to say the least. \nPerhaps, the \n come to us from ill-defined evaluation concepts or individuals who were widely misrepresented in their early years.\nIn his mid-twenties, Chip was taking part in three different businesses, and as a self-thought owner, he really had it going. His best buddies were a group of Mexicans, who he believed are the embodiment of the hard-working mentality.\nThe biggest problem he faced, while working with them was the language barrier.\nAt one point, he would even mix English and Spanish to create a brand new language, making everyone more confused than before.\nChip had enough and decided to go to Mexico and learn Spanish.\nHis girlfriend was really supportive, unlike his parents who advised him that running three businesses is more than enough.\nAnd yes, upon leaving the States and heading over to Mexico, problems began to pile up.\nJoanna (his girlfriend) wasn\u2019t ready to take on the responsibility of running his business or keep it afloat should you prefer, without him. When the time came to collect the rents from the students, she was in for a big surprise.\nChip \u201cforgot\u201d to tell her how much begging is required to get it done.\nMr. Stevens (Joanna\u2019s dad) even had contractors storming into his office, people who demanded their money. Joanna was quick of study, and immediately called his parents, and went there for dinner. They managed to access Chip\u2019s bank account, lend him some money in order to cover the incurring expenses.\nThe crisis was over, and Chip got away thanks to the brilliance of his girlfriend and parents.\nLet\u2019s go back for a second!\nWhen Chip was 26, he met Joanna for the very first time. Probably he had goosebumps, the minute he laid eyes upon her, and somehow thought that she is the type of girl he would like to date.\nShe was intriguing and unique, which made Chip want to spend time with her.\nAfter the first couple of dates, he didn\u2019t plan on tying the knot, neither did she, but it was a great transition for a guy that didn\u2019t have plenty of serious relationships.\nWhen they got married, Chip and Joanna unlike most of the couples, had the support of both parents on both sides.\nYou would often hear people say \u2013 opposites attract, and that statement couldn\u2019t get any truer regarding their relationship.\nChip was that risk-taking kind of guy, who looked at rules as an opportunity to break them, while Joanna was quiet and soft.\nHis time in Mexico was all Joanna needed to help Chip gain stability over his businesses. \nChip even declares that he doesn\u2019t know whether Joanna felt sorry for him and jumped on board, or simply didn\u2019t want to throw away the time and effort she put in while he was gone.\nWith that said, she became his secret weapon.\nA girl who knew how to set things straight!\nAs their relationship grew stronger, they learned how to play on each other\u2019s aptitudes. \nOne being down to earth and the other being a dreamer, who occasionally overlooked the numbers. And by now, you probably know which one is which!\nProbably, the greatest challenge they faced was to refrain from talking about business at home. \nAnd this might not seem like a big deal, but it was harder than it looks.\nHaving the time to spend in the effort to grow as a family, wasn\u2019t easy at all!\nAfter a couple of fights, they kind of had this breakthrough which was composed of cutting the other enough slack to get the ball rolling. \nIs there a better way to organize your life than to have a lifelong companion who is there to back you up no matter what?\nThis frantic lifestyle gave little room to catch a breather, and in the process, Chip learned a lot.\nOne of the things he deems are ultra important, is to take into account all opinions.\nYou can\u2019t run a business while neglecting other people\u2019s perspective, and the same goes when forging a relationship with another human being.\nThat inner voice that just can\u2019t seem to go away is where the magic comes from!\nIt takes a bit of practice to get good at it, and nobody is saying that it\u2019s going to be an easy battle!\nNow it\u2019s time to Grow!\nChip argues that fear was never a major factor in his \n. He and Joanna understood that when you are not trying to avoid failure, fear loses its grip and vanishes in the air.\nHowever, one cannot simply believe that fear is solely associated with failure.\nSometimes, we dread the idea of talking to someone, or placing our faith in that person\u2019s hands!\nBy all means, at given times it\u2019s okay to feel skeptical, but that mustn\u2019t become the driving factor.\nAnd yes, life isn\u2019t always cheerful, but even the setback can be construed as an adventure rather than fear.\nNobody is saying that you should disavow your past, but you should not push the panic button just yet.\nLet\u2019s tell you a quick story!\nOne day, Jo was dropping the kids off at school and had a vision.\nShe caught sight of two obsolete silos, looming out of the shadows.\nCan you imagine if we put all of our business in one spot? \u2013 She said. Chip really liked the idea, because they could expand their office and workspace, and the kids\u2019 school was just across the street.\nYet, the price of the property was substantial, and they knew that revamping the old buildings from the ground up will take considerable effort and money.\nThe financial risk was by no means small; to them, this was the biggest project they\u2019ve ever undertaken.\nChip, the wild risk-taker suddenly felt a surge of adrenaline mixed with fear. \nIf the project isn\u2019t successful, they would probably \n.\nHowever, one great analogy helped Chip see the big picture. According to this philosophy, the win-lose mindset is just made-up idiocy. \nSometimes, one step back leads to two-step forward in the long haul, which means that you must be able to discern differences between temporary setbacks or hurdles and giving up.\nIf you are compelled to take chances, bet on yourself! \nYou might not always win, but if you don\u2019t try how would you know which side you\u2019re on?\nThe bottom line is \u2013 people who have that winner\u2019s edge, or winning mentality should not be afraid of the unforeseeable future. Because no matter, where life winds take you, you\u2019ll always be on the right side.\nAlong the way, you\u2019ll face some hurdles, but you will never feel defeated!\nAnd that\u2019s the magic of success.\nWhile at it, Chip doesn\u2019t fail to mention the hilarious side of things.\nSometimes it\u2019s demanding to be funny while the cameras are rolling because you lose the momentum while preparing for the act. \nSo, no \u2013 Chip doesn\u2019t want you to feel sorry for him; he just points out that withstanding pressure is part of the daily job.\nThose people who succumb to fear are okay to work for a system and prefer to be burden-free.\nThe 9 to 5:00 daily grind is what they want!\nChip is not in that category! He loves to create something from scratch, and take all the responsibility for stuff that might go both ways.\nPerhaps, that\u2019s why the TV audience resonates with the message both he and Jo, are trying to convey.\nNo matter what, they endeavor to lit the hearts of those who want to burst the bubble of mediocrity.\nKey Lessons from \u201cCapital Gaines\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don\u2019t be afraid of the dark\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keep your head up\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defeat doesn\u2019t mean failure\nDon\u2019t be afraid of the dark\nKids are afraid of the Boogieman, while the grown-ups try to anticipate the future, and take appropriate precautions to minimize risk.\nAlthough that\u2019s a natural response, we feel like you can do a lot better.\nJust keep believing in yourself, and go into the unknown.\nKeep your head up\nIt\u2019s true that proper action can forestall a bigger catastrophe.\nWith that said, it\u2019s not always possible to be at your best and act within the confines of flawlessness.\nTherefore, try to keep your morale high, even when things take an unexpected turn for the worse.\nDefeat doesn\u2019t mean failure\nWalking through life, and having an unobscured winning streak is not hard but impossible.\nYou have to practice your losing response, and get back on your feet as quickly as possible.\nTherefore, it\u2019s crucial not to perceive every stumbling block as an insurmountable obstacle.\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free \n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cCapital Gaines Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nWe hope you learn something from Chip and Joanne\u2019s life endeavors, because we at \n sure did.\nIt kind of gives the impression of \u201c\n\u201d against \u201c\n\u201d but it\u2019s more like \u201c\n\u201d vs \u201c\n.\u201d\nWe urge you to read this book, because surely, you\u2019ll find a lot of cool stuff on how to achieve your dreams."},

Read on to find out why\u00a0\nis\none of Bill Clinton\u2019s favorite books.\nIt doesn\u2019t surprise us that this book is popular because\u00a0Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\u00a0expertly\u00a0combines general and scientific knowledge with a casual writing style. And then there\u2019s\u00a0the great content, too.\nEFFORTLESS FLOWING / FLOW\nFlow \u2013 happiness is attainable, no matter different cultures, physical condition, status or wealth, but requires work.\nCsikszentmihalyi, originally from Eastern Europe, came to the United States to start a career in psychology. He was especially intrigued by the sense of meaning in general, and the meaning of life in particular.\nThe world needs your contribution! Not only for providing the society with a service, but also for yourself. So, an unhappy person is a pain for the society, if you don\u2019t like your job \u2013 quit immediately. Have some pride, flow through life; do not swim. A worried person is detail-orientated if you are such change your surroundings. Follow the basic solution that Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi talks about.\nGetNugget contributes as well to his theory by paying close attention to each step of this helpful process. The book \u201cFlow\u201d prompts one question \u2013 Do I need this suffering (referring to your job)? If you think you deserve better \u2013 \u00a0fight for it. Take what is yours rightfully! Push your mind to the limits, the only way for a person to become more productive is to feel self-satisfied. Depressed individuals can barely stand still. What steps should you take to find your contribution more valuable?\nTransform your dull and routine life into something more dynamic. Perhaps, not too dynamic like some action movies, but creative enough to make you believe in something, live each day as if it was your last.\nThe book is split into the following chapters:\n\u00a0is based on\u00a0Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s 20 years of research into the phenomenon of \u2018flow\u2019. \u00a0He observed the state of mind of artists, who are totally absorbed in their work when they create something.\u00a0 He also asked artists, mountain climbers, workers, and athletes about their feelings when they created their own activities.\nBesides interesting facts about history, philosophy, and science, we find out that the state of flow is an ancient philosophy, sometimes known as Ju or yoga.\nThis state of flow is present in all types of activity, everything from work and leisure to personal relationships. We\u2019re interested in it because of its ability to make us happy. We all long for happiness but we have no clue where to find it; if we \n find it, we usually don\u2019t know how to keep it.\nThink of all the advances of the last century, the scientific breakthroughs, the changes in technology, the diseases we wiped out, the growth of our economies and our wealth. Sure, divorce rates are at an all-time high. There are conflicts and terrorism, and we have yet to find a cure for cancer. But overall our standards of living have gone up. W can travel, we can share our favorite photos with the entire world, we can keep in touch with old friends who live thousands of miles away. So why aren\u2019t we happy?\naims to teach us how to find happiness.\u00a0We need more than just pure ambition to obtain it. It\u2019s not possible to get it by force. We need several things to align in order to experience it, because:\nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi explores the human mind, and what it needs to attain flow.\nWe can use the skills we possess to help direct our attention towards our goal. The process is guided by attention and sustained by energy. But enjoyment occurs just for those who are motivated by the pleasure of doing something, and not by external influence. The road towards our goal allows us to \u201cflow\u201d optimally and effortlessly. The higher the goal is, and the more effort you put into it, the more substantial and stable the growth.\nWe have the ability to experiment with a flow in almost every activity: through our senses; moving; creating; accomplishing basic physical needs or complex mental tasks \u2013 playing chess, solving crosswords; or spending time with friends and family. All these can be transformed into very enjoyable minutes or even hours. The choice is in our willpower.\nThe main benefit of the experience is that we acquire new skills, obtain a higher understanding of a situation, develop ourselves. It prepares us for the next challenge, tougher\u00a0than the previous one, and the ability to enjoy the path we are following becomes easier. The quality of the goal determines your level of spirituality. With practice, we find we\u2019re able to change our moods, the direction of our thoughts, and make them work for our benefit.\nThe process described in \n\u00a0by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi is further investigated for its use in several areas of human existence. One in particular, flow in work, has been developed and put into practice by many others.\nSpending more time at work than at home means we have\u00a0to create work places, environments, and conditions that bring us enjoyment and increases our performance. Specialists find it interesting that satisfaction in work doesn\u2019t depend on position, reward, or environment, but rather on our ability to improve, to produce higher-quality work and enjoy what we do.\nIn chapter 9, \u201cCheating Chaos\u201d, Csikszentmihalyi describes the research he carried out on people with physical disabilities. We hear stories of several of our peers, who were either in accidents or born with a disability.

And Why?\nDon\u2019t be afraid to be that person who thrives on myriad challenges. This book expands your views and gives you something new to hold on to.\nAs a book of today, that reveals the troubles of yesterday, we believe that any person would find it interesting, inspiring and ultimately entertaining.\nAbout\u00a0Nassim Nicholas Taleb\n\u00a0is a renowned personality and an amazing writer.\nDespite being the author of several highly inspirational books like\u00a0\n,\u00a0\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nhe also works at New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering as a professor of risk engineering.\nHe was born in 1960 in Lebanon, and from an early age, Taleb had interest in various activities that weren\u2019t typical for a 10-year-old boy.\nNevertheless, he later turned to be a genius and mastered the artistry of randomness, possibility, uncertainty.\n\u201cAntifragile PDF Summary\u201d\nIt seems like Nassim Nicholas Taleb continues to impress with his ideas.\nThis fantastic book serves as a reminder that we are becoming too \u201cFragile.\u201d If you not convinced about the meaning let\u2019s share a thing or two.\nThe greatest strength is to avoid being at the mercy of other people, events or circumstances.\nIn fact, the core idea that motivated Taleb to create this idiosyncratic, and insightful book is briefly explained as well.\nThe revolution starts from within, bear hardship, and keep going \u2013 you are the next generations of \u201cAntifragiles.\u201d We assume that each of you has at least some basic understanding of what it means to be fragile.\nLet\u2019s expand on this theory:\nFragility is a threat to us all, mostly referring to things related to the global economy and market. Although the actual meaning of \u201cAntifragile\u201d denotes something durable, or unbreakable thing, Nassim mainly refers to flexibility.\nThe creation of this term indicates that it\u2019s possible to surmount any obstacle despite all the \n twists, disruptions that may occur down the road.\nFrom a practical point of view, the author advocates for a\u00a0system that can cope with various types of crisis. Just by scanning Nassim Nicholas Taleb\u2019s prologue \u2013 you can get an aerial view of the effects of Fragility.\nThe process of identifying all fragile elements can last forever, so let\u2019s take a short break to figure out what to do next.\nIn this case, it\u2019s best if you stay away from false claims and accusations. For instance, he dismantles the need for micromanagement and\u00a0transparently describes what it means to undergo an antifragile reform.\nAntifragile gives importance and priority to ethics, meanwhile underlying the stories of many heroes who risked everything for other people\u2019s sake.\nWhat about society?\nTaleb implies that \n should revamp their structure, and apply a new model that is proven to be morally superior to others.\nAccording to him, the modern world is the \u201clegitimate successor\u201d of two major illusions: intervention and prediction. Both systems are tilted toward domination and control over the people. Mostly using superstitiousness.\nTo get this point even further, Taleb in \u201cAntifragile\u201d gives birth to various conceptual examples, which reveal some of the hypocrisy in the economy, medicine, and politics.\nEven if it\u2019s hard for you to follow the voice of reason, the facts will surely convince you otherwise.\nNot only that this classic expose false ideologies and dangerous ideas, but in return, it offers allegiance to\n \u2013 you never had.\nKey Lessons from \u201cAntifragile\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The basic laws\n\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Understand the strong bond\n\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Faith in history\nThe basic laws\nTaleb once again shows his immense expertise by explaining some fundamental principles that must be enforced \n.\nHe \u201cpicks up a fight\u201d with individuals who believe that formal education emerged as any other practical thing.\nHe highly admires the American society for their risk-taking mentality and discredits other risk-aversive cultures.\nUnderstand the strong bond\nTo fully understand the impact of antifragility, one must be clear about its meaning and the link it has with modernity.\nAccording to Taleb, modernity is best explained as a model that contributes to fragility, by attempting to control everything.\nAccording to this classic, in order to oppose this method Taleb, presents a fictional character who instead of taking failures too personal, it perceives them as data.\nFaith in history\nTaleb embraces some traditional concepts, and always seeks a way, that will grant him \u201csafe-return\u201d to central ideas, and tested methods.\nHowever, don\u2019t let this fool you because, on the other hand, he will always be the one \u2013 who fiercely promotes risk!!\n\u201cAntifragile\u201d Quotes\nOur Critical Review\nThis book definitely enters into the \u201cmasterpiece\u201d category. In our opinion, you\u2019ll immediately sense the tension arising from it, and relief in the end.\nIn an antifragile world, uncertainty becomes necessary, for only that which is antifragile can grow and develop. Antifragile is the instruction manual for living in a world full of possibilities, and this microbook will introduce you to its key concepts.\nFragility is a simple concept. We know that porcelain or a set of crystal bowls are fragile items that require special care.\nIf they are not handled with care, they will inevitably break, and therefore we must know how to deal with this fragility, to be ready for unforeseen events.\nIt is necessary to pack them well for transport, to ensure that in case of unexpected occurrence, they do not break.\nBut when we try to talk about the opposite of fragility, we have great difficulty. How should we call that which is not fragile? Many would say that the opposite of fragility is robustness.\nBut robustness is not the opposite of weak.\nA sturdy item may not even break when an accident occurs, but it does not benefit from this situation.\nIf the fragile needs a package that says \u201cHandle with care,\u201d the item we are looking for is a piece that the less care it receives when handled, the stronger it becomes.\nApparently, no word defines this situation, items that benefit from the unexpected. Taleb wed the coined that will guide our narrative: the Antifragile, which is the antithesis of the fragile.\nHis example to describe what antifragility is the \u00a0Lernaean Hydra, a figure of Greek mythology. The Hydra was a multi-headed serpent that terrified the Greeks and was known to be indestructible.\nEach time someone cut one of the heads, two others grew in that place. The more the Hydra was attacked, the stronger it became.\nShe was the definition of the antifragile.\nAn example of antifragility is the process of evolution of living things.\nThink of the evolutionary theory of Charles Darwin, about how creatures change and adapt. Evolution only happens in a fickle and hostile environment.\nWhenever a difficulty occurs, evolution forces life to adjust so that it fits well into the new environment.\nHowever, there is an interesting aspect of this concept: while the process itself is antifragile, the individuals who participate in it are fragile.\nEvolution happens when genetic code is passed and generates changes known as mutations.\nAs the changes persist, the individuals who have helped in this change suffer over time. The death of these members is necessary to make room for evolution.\nOne of the rules of antifragility is precisely this: for a system to be antifragile, most of its parts must be fragile.\nIt\u2019s because parts of an antifragile system work with information that feeds you through your successes or failures, showing what works and what\u2019s not okay.\nFailures, therefore, are a crucial part of the process, which works in a trial-and-error method.\nWith every mistake made by the individuals involved, the system strengthens because it learns new things and becomes better.\n is also an antifragile system. The constituent parts, such as people and companies, are somehow fragile, but the economy itself is the opposite.\nFor it to grow, some of these parts must fail, because we must learn from the mistakes made by its elements.\nWhen a company ends up failing, it teaches the other parts of the economic system some lessons about how not to die in this environment.\nThe antifragility is part of our day to day and is present at all times.\nWhen we do physical exercises, for example, we are experiencing antifragility because we are exposing our body to abnormal forces, so that it strengthens and grows our muscles.\nIn one exercise, muscles are confronted by stressful forces, such as weights.\nThis power makes our antifragile system respond with overcompensation, improving our ability to deal with stresses that in theory would cause fragility.\nStrength comes from overcompensation in times of adversity, and it leaves anti-fragile systems with elements of excess power built in response to stressors.\nIn theory, we waste strength in exercising, and common sense tells us that success depends on the efficient use of our resources, not waste.\nOn the other hand, overcompensation and redundancy are vital to antifragility, as they prepare us for unknown and uncertain problems.\nThe exercise that seemed like a waste of time actually can save us from an emergency where we need to run or jump.\nThis redundancy, in fact, leaves us better able to cope and survive in adverse and unexpected situations.\nConsistency and predictability end up creating fragile systems. While antifragility is found in natural and biological systems, fragile systems are often artificial.\nTherefore, most things created by man should not be antifragile, because they cannot improve through mistakes and the unexpected.\nA human-made system may even be robust, but it is rarely anti-fragile. Think, for example, of a car.\nThe car can run thousands of miles and last for dozens of years but its use, over time, will make it weaker and worn, until the moment it succumbs.\nHowever, although uncommon, there are artificial antifragile systems.\nThe economy, for example, has an almost biological structure and is so complex that it has become antifragile. But complexity alone does not make a system antifragile.\nTo be anti-fragile, it also needs inconsistency. Inconsistencies are shocks and stressors that define which units should die to strengthen the system.\nIn a predictable and calm system, there are no stressors and also no pressure on the units of the system.\nWith this, the antifragility of the scheme gradually disappears. Therefore, trying to control the antifragile tends only to weaken it.\nIn most cases where a government tries to tame the economy through interventions and regulations, for example, the weakens the economy.\nWhen a government tries to make its economy more predictable, it removes stressors, and this eventually weakens the system.\nTranquility removes the information that is learned by inconsistency, through trial and error, which weakens the system as a whole.\nOur society overestimates theoretical and academic knowledge and tends to underestimate practical knowledge.\nWe tend to believe that theoretical knowledge will lead us to practical knowledge, but this is rare.\nThink of it this way: if you know how to design a rocket, you probably do not know how to be an astronaut.\nNassim Taleb has extensive experience in international capital markets. He realized these markets were extremely inconsistent and that the most successful investors had the least formal education.\nAlthough they did not understand much about economic theory or knew the countries in which they invested, they knew the right time to put invest their money.\nIt is therefore important to know that it is entirely possible to benefit from an anti-fraud system without understanding its theoretical principles.\nTo do this, you need to have options and choices in this system, such as options to buy and sell stocks from stock exchanges.\nIf the system brings you opportunities, but with no obligation on your side, you have the optionality. You may choose to buy or sell, but you can also simply do nothing.\nIt is possible to be an investor without knowing in theory how market fluctuations work, as long as you have the practical knowledge to know at what time you should exercise your options and thus take advantage of the opportunities.\nThe optionality exists in all systems. You use your options in all your day-to-day decisions, and they only fit you.\nYou can go to a party by car, on foot or by subway. You may even just not go. These choices are yours, and no one can force you to choose an option.\nPeriods of inconsistency and uncertainty are inevitable. We go through periods of crisis in our personal, professional lives, face economic crises and come across unpredictable accidents.\nOne must understand the variable and accept it to become an antifragile person.\nTo become antifragile, there is no need to avoid uncertainties. It is necessary to know what extreme situations can happen and prepare for it.\nThe first way to prepare yourself is by focusing on the \u2018negative element\u2019 that can occur. Knowing what the negative part is, you can reduce your risks.\nFor example, if you want to protect yourself from the economy\u2019s inconsistencies, you should prepare and make sure that most of your assets are safe and will not suffer from market volatility.\nTaleb recommends that you put 90% of your assets into investments of \n.\nBy doing so, you may end up making less money on riskier investments, but on the other hand, you guarantee your financial stability.\nOnce you protect yourself against adverse contingencies, you should focus on the other side: the positive element.\nIf you have saved 90% of your assets to avoid exposing yourself to potential fluctuations in the economy, you can now use the remaining 10% in the best possible way.\nWith this 10 %, you can take risks, because even if things go wrong, you are putting at stake only those 10%, which will not affect you permanently.\nThis approach protects your equity, but it also gives you the chance to capitalize on a scenario where a positive element occurs and brings you significant gains.\nAn example of a poor allocation of resources would be, for instance, if you put 100% of your assets into a medium-risk investment.\nYou do not protect yourself and expose yourself to positive and negative elements at the same time. Doing so means putting the future of your money in a condition of extreme risk and uncertainty.\nIf you do not have options, you are surrounded. Imagine that you have to make a hotel reservation in a city on a date where the flow of tourists is very high.\nYou look at all the hotels, and you can not find a room. When you find the last place of the city, the price is very high.\nUnfortunately, you can not do anything, just pay for that reservation. Bad, isn\u2019t it?\nWhen you are surrounded, you have only one option and have to follow it regardless of the cost to you.\nAnd the cost of not having options will be determined by the size of the pressure: the higher the pressure, the harder it will be to deal with it.\nIn case of the hotel, for example, the costs may be high for the person who is reserving the room, but they would be worse if she had decided to take the whole family on this trip.\nThe more complex the situation, the more expensive it becomes to get out of it.\nWith the world economy increasingly connected because of globalization, the world is increasingly exposed to pressures of colossal dimensions.\nIn economics, for example, if a large company is left with no options to survive, a domino effect occurs.\nYour suppliers, employees, and customers are affected, and as they are affected, other businesses and people continue to be impacted.\nAny major economic problem nowadays is global and universal, and its consequences reverberate at high speed.\nThe great financial crisis of 2008 left significant scars on the contemporary economy.\nThese professionals were completely wrong, and the crisis cost the world economy billions of dollars.\nEven after a wrong and disastrous prediction, many of these \u2018experts\u2019 \n, without having to apologize for the mistake made in the 2008 crisis.\nThat is because, in areas such as this, professionals know each other, coexist and depend on each other, so there are great fear and care in making any more incisive criticism to a fellow professional.\nAlthough their analyses and predictions about the crisis have been completely wrong and have negatively impacted the lives of millions of people, the mistakes of these professionals are quickly forgotten.\nThis type of situation exemplifies a serious problem in modern society: many people\u2019s antifragility exists because others are suffering damage.\nIn the case of these specialists, these people gain prestige when they are right, but they do not suffer consequences when they are wrong.\nThe analyst on Wall Street and the other financial markets has become an anti-fraud professional because he is not taking risks with his attitudes, but with those of other people.\nIt happens in a similar way to bankers.\nIn the medieval era, bankers who talked and lost money from their clients were decapitated. That made all managers think of the common good and not just their gains.\nToday, however, modern bankers \n, after all, if they risk right, they make a lot of money for themselves, and if they fail, they have nothing to lose.\nOther people\u2019s money is at stake and optionality is given to them.\nThe way we think about our society has a fundamental problem.\nWe believe that we need to make our community as quiet and consistent as possible. As people become smarter, they also become more arrogant and want more control over the world.\nBecause inconsistency is something we can not predict, we try to avoid it and reduce it, to have control over the world.\nPoliticians and economists tend to think that our economic cycle of ups and downs is inefficient and unpredictable, and they work trying to understand how to control it so that it improves and evolves.\nThey develop complex economic theories that point out the times when there must be intervention in economic cycles so that we can be able to predict better.\nHowever, this policy of acting \u201ccorrectively\u201d in a system is called naive interventionism.\nUnfortunately, we do not know as much as we think we are aware and this means that, instead of improving our systems, we end up making them more fragile, without realizing it.\nBy trying to make these systems more predictable, we are stealing the volatility they need to survive and evolve.\nWithout the inconsistency, there is no antifragility, and the problems are no longer visible, hiding under a false tranquility.\nThen, unknowingly, these problems reach gigantic proportions that are much harder to deal with.\nAn interesting example would be to think of a forest. Every forest is in danger of being burned down.\nHowever, the risk of a massive fire is reduced every time a small fire occurs. Small fires periodically remove flammable materials from the forest without reaching a significant number of trees.\nThe smaller fire is an example of volatility, a feature that helps prevent significant problems. As we avoid volatility, we are getting more prone to devastating fires.\nOur society has the bad habit of making predictions based on a narrow and small view of the past.\nIt makes those who follow the forecasts may be at risk of consequences when the expected events do not happen.\nAnother shortcoming is to believe that the worst thing we have ever witnessed is the worst thing that can happen.\nThe fact that there was a terrorist attack on September 11 that destroyed two towers in New York does not mean that something of much greater proportions cannot occur in the future.\nBelieving in our ability to predict the future leads us to have emergency plans for limited adverse situations and does not allow us to think about all the bad things that can happen.\nEmergencies can be unpredictable and unlikely, and we have to rely on the worst-case scenario to predict.\nAn interesting example comes from engineering. The Fukushima nuclear power plant, for instance, was built to withstand the largest earthquake ever seen in the world.\nHowever, its creators were not aware that a larger earthquake than the past could happen in the future.\nIn 2011, even though the plant was built for past earthquakes, a major earthquake destroyed the plant\u2019s reactor.\nWe tend to believe that the Industrial Revolution was one caused by scientific progress.\nThat\u2019s what they teach in schools, is not it? Most think that theoretical advances have guided the technological advances that transform the way society produces products and thus the economy.\nBut this is not true. When the Industrial Revolution occurred, it was not led by academics but by individuals without formal education.\nThe submarine, for example, was invented by a pastor and not by a university or a naval institution.\nOther important inventions also came as the results of people who worked independently.\nThey came from people who were experimenting with \nIt was this dynamic of trial and error that guaranteed that the Industrial Revolution occurred, forming an anti-fragile system.\nToday our society does not understand the importance of antifragility and the official narrative of Industrial Revolution is proof of this.\nWe do not like to imagine that our progress may have come through a system of trial and error, and we prefer to believe in more deterministic reasons for having advanced as a society.\nOur society wants our experts to know exactly what they are doing and not for them to try and find out what works.\nIt has significant effects on modern society. For example, several scientists end up getting resources for their research promising breakthrough discoveries from academia.\nThese researchers receive money from governments and private initiative to create new theories and discoveries that will make our lives easier.\nUnfortunately, what is not clear to all is that it is possible to achieve all the promised progress through just these theories: randomness and antifragility from chaos are necessary for the emergence of real changes and innovations.\nFinal Notes:"},

It\u2019s not merely about owning your mistakes (which is, nevertheless, difficult and a big part of it); but, it\u2019s also about balance. \nAnd a lot of it!\nA good leader must be \u2013 Jocko Willink and Leif Babin pointed out explicitly in the conclusion of their most celebrated book:\nWell, this is exactly what \nis all about.\nIts goal is to go deeper beneath the dichotomies listed above, so as to \u201chelp leaders overcome the struggle through examples of how to find the right balance in leadership \u2013 to moderate the idea of leading from the extremes and focus on maintaining balance \u2013 within teams, among peers, and both up and down the chain of command.\u201d \nThe book is divided into 3 parts and contains 12 chapters, each of which examines a single dichotomy, through a memorable example from the battlefield.\nHowever, since this is a summary, we\u2019ll share with you only the principles.\nPart I: Balancing People\nThere are limitless dichotomies in leadership, but none are as difficult and as central as this one: to care deeply about your people (Part I), and yet, at the same time, accept the risks necessary to accomplish the mission (Part II).\nIn other words, in addition to building strong relationships with your subordinates, you also need to recognize that you are a leader with a mission, aka you have a job to do.\nIf you care too much about your objectives, you\u2019ll neglect your people; care more about them than is necessary and you\u2019ll compromise the success of the mission.\nA good leader always finds a way to drive his team to accomplish the mission without pushing them off a cliff.\nIf you know your extreme ownership principles well, you should be pretty much aware that this one is the foundation upon all the others are built: effective leaders take ownership of every mistake, and never place blame on anyone else.\nBut this doesn\u2019t mean that you should make every decision for everyone on your team; that\u2019s called micromanagement and is awful; however, hands-off leadership also doesn\u2019t work, because it usually leads to a cacophony of commands.\nEffective leaders always find a balance between these two extremes: \n\u201cWith Extreme Ownership,\u201d concludes Willink, \u201cyou are responsible for everything in your world. But you can\u2019t make every decision. You have to empower your team to lead, to take ownership. So, you have to give them ownership.\u201d \nLeaders should be neither lenient nor overbearing\u2019 to find the balance, they must learn when it is important for them to hold the line and when they should allow some slack; and then carefully evaluate each situation.\nTwo things should help you do this: understanding the concept of \u201cleadership capital\u201d and the power of \u201cwhy.\u201d\nThe former refers to the \u201cfinite amount of power that any leader possesses.\u201d Now, you can expend it foolishly on strategically unimportant matters, or you can smartly allow your people to blow off some steam in some of these less critical areas.\nBecause you\u2019ll need to exert that power when push comes to shove. And so that you can be sure that others will listen when it really matters \u2013 give them a reason to.\nThe \n.\nAnother lesson from \nthere are no bad teams, only bad leaders. And also \u2013 the team always comes before the individual.\nWhen an individual thinks otherwise, then you need to react: underperformers usually just need to be led properly.\nHowever, \u201cwhen a leader has done everything possible to get an individual up to speed without seeing results, the time has come to let that individual go. Don\u2019t be too quick to fire \u2013 but don\u2019t wait too long. Find the balance and hold the line.\u201d\nPart II: Balancing the Mission\nHard training is critical to the performance of any team; after all, there\u2019s no growth in the comfort zone. \nConsequently, training must be hard. It should push the team beyond the limits of their day-to-day easy (because learned by heart) tasks and prepare them for greater challenges; all good training focuses on three critical aspects: realism, fundamentals, and repetition.\nTraining must be realistic. It should push the team \u2013 and the leaders, especially \u2013 into realistic, uncomfortable situations where they aren\u2019t sure what to do. So, role-play scenarios in which hard decisions must be made immediately. (\n)\nTraining must focus on the fundamentals; often people think they know them and want to skip through them, but the truth is our brain and memory don\u2019t work that way; never skip the fundamentals lest you want to forget them.\nAnd that brings us to the final point: training must be repetitive. Repetition is the mother of learning: \n.\n\u201cAn aggressive mindset should be the default setting of any leader,\u201d writes Willink in Chapter 6 of \n.\nAnd that\u2019s because an aggressive mind is a proactive mind: it doesn\u2019t mean an angry one or one that loses its temper easily. It merely means one who is trained to react in the best possible way in the worst possible scenario.\nForget your \n: the only aggression which wins \u2013 and every single member of the military knows this \u2013 is the one directed towards the problem, not towards the people.\nHowever, aggression can devolve into recklessness, especially if you get a case of that strange \u201cdisease of victory.\u201d\nNever get complacent, no matter how many victories your decisions earn.\nOverconfidence is your enemy.\nAlexander Pope once wrote:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n.\nIn other words, when you learn by heart the rules that should guide your steps in a dance, you\u2019ll suddenly feel the full freedom of movement, and walking would feel as easy as flying.\nRules give freedom; however, too much of them, stifle it. \nSo, never forget: leading a team is about procedures and processes because discipline gives more freedom; however when it stops doing that \u2013 then the procedures probably don\u2019t work.\nAccountability is an important tool, but should never be the primary one:\n\u201cA reliance on heavy accountability,\u201d concludes the chapter, \u201cconsumes the time and focus of the leader and inhibits the trust, growth, and development of subordinates.\u201d\nBalance accountability, on the other hand, results in empowerment and educated subordinates. And that\u2019s the goal!\nPart III: Balancing Yourself\nThere\u2019s a reason why you should never allow your subordinates to feel as subordinates: it stifles their creativity and incapacitates them to make a decision when they are expected to; they\u2019d expect that from you.\nSo, in other words, you should train your subordinates to be latent leaders, because sometimes your job will be to \n.\n\u201cLeaders must be willing to listen and follow others,\u201d writes Babin, \u201cregardless of whether they are junior or less experienced. If someone else has a great idea or specific knowledge that puts them in the best position to lead a particular project, a good leader recognizes that it doesn\u2019t matter who gets the credit, only that the mission is accomplished in the most effective manner possible.\u201d\n.\nUsually, the team who wins is the team who is capable of seeing a little step further into the future. And, obviously, being able to plan ahead is a trait of great leaders.\nHowever, there\u2019s a limit beyond which planning becomes a burden; it\u2019s, more or less, a physical limit. Unless you\u2019re a chess player, you can\u2019t remember a million scenarios; and even if you are, you may forget the one you need when you need it the most, and, thus, lose due to over-preparedness.\nThe trick is to choose three or four most probable contingencies for each phase and a worst-case scenario and prepare for them.\nEverything else is probably just an iteration, and you\u2019ll do just fine when \u2013 or even if \u2013 that happens.\nThere\u2019s a difference between being humble and being passive: the latter is one of the worst traits a leader might have and the former \u2013 \n. \nIn fact, Leif Babin says that is \u201cthe most important quality in a leader.\u201d Case in point: SEAL leaders are usually fired not because of unfitness, unsoundness or incompetence \u2013 but because of arrogance.\nHowever, the point is not to become humble to a fault, because being \n humble usually leads to passivity and leaders should be \npassive.\nOnce again, it\u2019s all about the balance.\n\u201cLeaders must be humble enough to listen to new ideas, willing to learn strategic insights, and open to implementing new and better tactics and strategies,\u201d writes Babin. \n\u201cBut a leader must also be ready to stand firm when there are clearly unintended consequences that negatively impact the mission and risk harm to the team. \u201c\nNaturally, it\u2019s always good to be attentive to details; however, once again, there\u2019s a point after which this attentiveness becomes a liability. \nJust like you should never allow yourself to not see the trees because of the wood, you can\u2019t risk not seeing the wood from the trees.\nThis is what \u201cfocused, but detached\u201d means: you must find a way to analyze the details of every situation, while still not losing the sight of the big picture.\nFor that\u2019s the only context in which the details really matter.\nAfterword\nWillink and Babin conclude their exploration of the dichotomies of leadership thus:\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Dichotomy of Leadership\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How to Balance Your People\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How to Balance Your Mission\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How to Balance Yourself\nHow to Balance Your People\nIn order to be a good leader, you need to find a great balance between some of the dichotomies of leadership.\nThe ultimate one concerns the two most important aspects of it: you need to both care about your people and still be willing to put them in risky situations because of your mission.\nSo as to do this, you need to own your mistakes, but also empower others to make theirs; you need to be resolute, but not overbearing; and you need to know when to mentor and when to fire.\nHow to Balance Your Mission\nBalancing the mission starts before the mission itself \u2013 with training. Training must be hard, but also smart; the former is self-explanatory, the latter is based on three vital aspects: realistic situations, foundations, and repetitiveness. \nTo balance your mission, you need to be aggressive, not reckless, and disciplined, but not rigid. You also need to hold your people accountable but never hold their hands as well.\nYou\u2019re a leader, and they expect to be led by you.\nHow to Balance Yourself\nBalancing yourself as a leader is all about staying humbled; humbled doesn\u2019t mean staying passive \u2013 it means staying open to suggestions and ideas. In other words, humble leaders also know when it\u2019s best for the team to be followers as well.\nHumble leaders are also focused, but never detached; and they know when planning becomes overplanning.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Dichotomy of Leadership Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nA worthy follow-up to \n, \ndelivers so well on the promises of Willink and Babin\u2019s but that some have called it even better than the original.Inspiring, practical and honest, \nis a book you should definitely read in case you want to become a leader as exceptional as two decorated Navy SEALs.\n\n"},

He is trying to make a change through his example of leading with a \n mentality.\nis structured in three parts.

Every company at the beginning is starting with an era of honesty and truth.\nNow it\u2019s\u00a0the time when the companies are more focused on satisfying customers. In order to do that competitive teams are created to work with. For Dale Partridge, this is a good argument for\u00a0defining the present time as a great one with a clear focus on leaders, benefits for both company and customers, and long-term strategies.\nOur human nature is designed to tirelessly seek more and more performance and efficiency.\nThis proves that the \n begins. \nThis era is usually described by terms as struggle and choices.

And Why?\nAre you ready to cross the Rubicon?\nThe exact opposite of pursuing job security is striving to achieve financial freedom. \nRobert Kiyosaki galvanized millions of people into action, and \u201c\n\u201d acts as a blueprint that will help you stay ahead of the game.\nThat is why we believe it to be an immensely powerful and enlightening read.\nAbout Robert T. Kiyosaki\n is a well-known businessman, entrepreneur, speaker and a financial coach that spells out the ingredients needed for achieving success in the digital age.\nAbove all else, he is the author of several bestselling books such as:\n\u201cSecond Chance PDF Summary\u201d\nRobert Kiyosaki divided this book into three parts: \nThe Past\nAs you might have guessed, Robert starts with the past. He recalls meeting a friend whom he had not seen in a while. \nRobert was slightly shocked seeing his friend working at Starbucks. \nWhat are you doing here, he asked?\nHis friend replied that after the market crash in 2007 he lost his job and house. He burned his life savings and was forced to apply for a low paying job.\nHe even enrolled in University to get a Master\u2019s degree.\nStudent loans? \u2013 \n. \nWell, what else can we do? \u2013 \n.\nRobert paid for his coffee and hit the road. \nOut of this life-situation, Robert wants to point out some irrefutable business realities:\nIn the past, the landlords were the ones who nowadays we\u2019d regard as rich. They controlled, embezzled, and utilized resources available at hand. \nThe ordinary person, however, without any ties to the aristocracy, was destined for hard labor. \nIn the age of digital expansionism, where access to valuable information is often free, why aren\u2019t more people rich? It takes knowledge to process information into practical expertise, and when you are going to Universities, you are not taught how to do that.\nThe birth of the lost generation is yet another phenomenon that plagues society. It\u2019s merely an illustration of the college-educated generation which is not able to find a job that matches their level of ambition.\nSuch reality lowers their earning potential during midlife years and leads to an increase in debt.\nIt might come as a shock to you but, student loans are rarely forgiven. In other words, even if you declare bankruptcy, there\u2019s hardly a chance that you\u2019ll get past the expensive journey you undertook in your early adulthood.\nRobert Kiyosaki calls them \u201c\n.\u201d\nKids who leave home, only to return broke and in total hopelessness.\nMany experts fear a New Great Depression. \nThe best way to look at the future is by being critical of the past. \nWhat are the key indicators that foreshadow an economic malaise?\nRobert Kiyosaki gives a lot of credit to Dr. Fuller who taught him how to predict the future and how to capitalize on emergencies.\nThe 2007 Market Fall was one of them.\nPoliticians will continue to sweep the problems under the rug, and it\u2019s your job to take care of the financial future.\nPeople struggle because of a lack of financial knowledge, and the inability to distinguish between assets and liabilities.\nAn old saying goes: \nRich Dad believes that getting financial advice from someone who doesn\u2019t eat unless they sell you something, is a dangerous game.\nAccording to Warren Buffett, it\u2019s of primary importance to understand the difference between a sales pitch, and valuable financial advice.\nPart Two \u2013 Present\nWe hate to rock your world, but those who place trust in the government to take care of them are in for a big surprise.\nThe Obamacare act was greeted with admiration and delight.\nThe Social Security Act made life easier for the WW2 generation but at the expense of the Vietnam War Generation. \nOnly time will tell whether the Obama Act will become a Social and Medical liability or better yet a \u201cBurden\u201d for the upcoming generations. \nRobert Kiyosaki asserts that the real instigator of Economic Slumps is our external-makeover mindset.\nWhat does it mean?\nIt points out that one\u2019s yearnings and lust for status, doesn\u2019t help you to become wealthy. \nAppearing is much easier, than actually being, to say the least!\nSecond Chance, as an aspect, must be brought into line with the process of metamorphosis. Can you turn into a butterfly and, fly away?\nWe all have this potential, but not everyone is cognizant of its abilities.\nSo, the real question is \u2013 What is holding you back? \nRobert brings up the importance of being able to read your financial statement. And yes, you would argue that you already know how to do that, but that\u2019s usually not the case.\nThese days, people prefer to look richer by distorting the actual reality.\nEven with higher income, they can\u2019t keep up with the incurred liabilities.\nIt took us 25 years to get out of the Great Depression (1929-1954), and the Federal Government did nothing in particular to appease the suffering. New policies were enacted in the 30s, and the WW2 period, but to no avail.\nWhat does that tell you? \nBig Government \u2260 Low Poverty Rates\nThe main thing no one has ever told you is that rich people don\u2019t work for money.\nThey try to own the means of production; they are not in pursuit of higher wages, etc. In other words, they are entrepreneurs from top to bottom. They nurture an entrepreneurial spirit which helps them to see the world through the lens of possibilities.\nThe second chance you\u2019ve been praying to get is finally at your doorstep.\nIn any financial statement, there are four basic asset-classes you can stumble upon:\nJust take a moment, and find out which one of these appeals to your entrepreneurial nature, the most.\nFrom what we\u2019ve been told, it\u2019s easy to see why \u201csavers\u201d can\u2019t and will not get rich. The quick rich scheme should also be discarded, not that miracles don\u2019t happen, but you shouldn\u2019t count on luck to do all the heavy lifting.\nKiyosaki shares his past fondness for commodities, gold & silver in particular.\nBefore you lay out the type of investment you would want to venture in, it\u2019s critical to exhibit some kind of love towards the process of building that asset. \nAnd last but not least \u2013 find out the game that could bring you money or the one you love to be a part of. History has shown us that a blend of commitment and passion increases the likelihood of a positive outcome.\nThe Future\nWhy does the education system skip the part about managing finances?\nThe fact that students learn nothing about money is why they end up drowning in debt upon graduation.\nWhen you deny education to certain groups (like slaves or women in the past), you are in control of their destiny. In some parts of the world, this practice is still around.\nBelieve it or not, the person who signs the paycheck exerts a lot of influence over the receiver. \nThe idea work harder doesn\u2019t seem to make any sense \u2013 Why?\nBecause the more you earn, the tax-percentage gets bigger. And, that\u2019s a clear indication of why the middle-class is shrinking with each passing generation. \nThe top 1% pay less than 13% in taxes, while the upper middle class pays up to 50%. \nAre the rich gaming the system?\nNo!\nThat\u2019s exactly what financial education does; it teaches you how to save your earnings and eradicate liabilities.\nPoor Dad teaches you to work for money; Rich Dad teaches you to acquire assets.\nIf you are working to produce Cash Flow, you are on the right track. \nHowever, if you are more into getting a higher paycheck, then you have the mindset of the Poor Dad.\nYou want to watch out for debt and taxes because they will rise proportionally with your paycheck.\nRobert Kiyosaki is a great fan of playing games that could help you think critically. In the meantime, you are getting ready for the actual world.\nMistake-learning method is the only one that can be deemed effective.\nBut what about education?\nIt\u2019s more important than ever, but that doesn\u2019t mean that by going to college you\u2019ll get what you\u2019ve bargained for.\nWhen it comes to the United States of America, which of the following poses a greater menace to national security?\nThe proper answer would be \u2013 Both!\nThe future is not pretty with regards to the US economy. Financial education is not being delivered, and the nation is in deep slumber.\nIs there a way to turn the tables on this?\nBucky Fuller said:\nHaving unshakable faith is your ticket to financial freedom, and it opens up the door for getting a second chance.\nOn top of that, we live in a Start-Up world. \nEveryone dreams of becoming the next Elon Musk, or Steve Jobs.\nHowever, nine out of ten business fail within the first five years. \nThe reason for their failure is what Robert Kiyosaki calls \u2013 over-specialization. \nWhen you know a lot about little, you\u2019re missing on the broader picture, crucial for staying in the game.\nOne of the things that people don\u2019t realize is that entrepreneurs never sleep.\nIt\u2019s partly the reason why so many start-ups fail, and why so many people prefer employee status. They don\u2019t have to worry about regulations, product costs, investments, marketing, equipment costs, taxes, etc.\nRemember, specialists, work for generalists.\nAs a matter of fact, that\u2019s the whole story behind \u201c\n.\u201d\nNo one can say for certain that one thing is better than the other because it varies on a case to case basis.\nYou have all the flexibility in the world to make up your mind and do what\u2019s necessary to achieve financial freedom.\nKey Lessons from \u201cSecond Chance\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Change your perspective\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Generalists are the money makers\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Big shoes to fill\nChange your perspective\nWe don\u2019t believe that everyone is predestined to become an entrepreneur, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t change your spending habits.\nIt truly is an important transition that will help you build your financial freedom and security.\nGeneralists are the money makers\nIt\u2019s needless to say that to run a business; you\u2019d have to have a broader outlook on the processes.

Hopefully, in combination with the map, this will help you follow the story better.\nLet\u2019s go!\nPart One\nThe book begins with a beautiful two-paragraph description of a marsh, coupled with an explanation of what is the difference between it and a swamp:\nOn the morning of October 30, 1969 \u2013 we are suddenly informed, and our blood is chilled to the bone \u2013 the body of someone named \nwas spotted in the marshes, near the fire tower, by two boys riding their bikes in the vicinity.\nWe go seventeen years back in time to observe the six-year-old \n \u2013 actually \n\u2013 running to the porch only so that she can see her \n leaving her and her family in a long black skirt, gator heels, a blue train case in her hand.\n a World War II veteran with a disability, is an abusive alcoholic. So, it\u2019s no wonder that after the flight of Ma, all of Kya\u2019s siblings \u2013 \n,\n,\n, and \n \u2013 leave as well. \nBefore too long, Kya and Pa are the only ones left in the rather isolated shack erected in the vicinity of Barkley Cove.\nSince Pa isn\u2019t that interested in taking care of Kya \u2013 at least not in the usual way \u2013 Kya attends school for no more than one single day.\nThe problem?\nShe barely looks like a human child, reminding her schoolmates much more of a feral kid; incapable of enduring the laughs and scorn of her schoolmates, Kya leaves school illiterate and unkempt \u2013 to never return to it again.\nEven though a child, Kya is pretty independent and self-reliant; however, one day, after she takes her father\u2019s boat, she gets lost in the lagoon.\nFortunately, a boy from the town named \n\u2013 four years her senior \u2013 notices her and helps her.\nHoping to see Tate again, Kya asks to go fishing with her father; and everything\u2019s nice for a while. But then, a letter from her mother arrives; Kya\u2019s Pa burns it and, ever since then, staunchly refuses to take Kya out to fishing again.\nBack in 1969, we learn some more details about the death of Chase Andrews.\nA former star quarterback, working at his parent\u2019s store Western Auto at the time of his death, Chase Andrews was (as you would only expect after such a description) a pretty handsome guy who had his way with the ladies of Barkley Cove.\nHe was also engaged, but hey, we\u2019re not here to judge; all we know at this point is that we\u2019re dealing with yet another episode of the show \u201clest you want to sleep with the fishes, avoid sleeping with the chicks.\u201d\nAfter being alerted by the two boys we mentioned above \u2013 the ten-year-old \n and \n \u2013 the sheriff discovers traces of red wool fibers at the scene; there are no fingerprints.\nKya is 10 in 1956.\nOne day, her Pa leaves the shack and doesn\u2019t come back.\nKnowing full well that she\u2019ll be taken away by social services unless she pretends that her father is still around, she does just that.\nIn order to earn money, she starts collecting mussels and starts selling these to a guy nicknamed \n.\nJumpin\u2019 \u2013 who has a bait and gas shop nearby \u2013 soon realizes that Kya is in trouble.\nSo, he asks for some help from his wife \n, who mobilizes the community, collecting donations at the church and trading them for Kya\u2019s fish.\nIn addition, Mabel teaches Kya how to garden and gives her some seeds so that she can start gardening.\nFour years pass and Barkley Cove is filled with rumors about a certain \n; Kya \u2013 who has learned to live well in solitude by know \u2013 unwittingly reinforces them, since she is constantly in hiding.\nNot only from the social services, but also from the kids banging on her door and pranking her the way they did on her first and only day at school.\nIn the meantime, Kya has also mastered the art of collecting, well, everything.\nOne day, a boy leaves a heron feather on a tree stump in the marsh; before too long, Kya starts communicating with him via feathers.\nSoon enough, she learns of his identity: it\u2019s none other than the only warm human being she has ever met: \n. \nTate not only gives Kya many useful things (spark plug, seeds, etc.), but he also teaches her to read. And when their meetings alert the social services, he also suggests to her that she leaves the shack and go \u201cwhere the crawdads sing\u201d:\nKya is 14 years old in 1960 and is very beautiful; one day, as Tate talks about his younger sister and his mother who died in a car crash, the two kiss.\nThe romance lasts for a while, but Tate has to leave for college; he tells Kya that he\u2019ll be back for her in a month.\nHowever, he\u2019s not. \nHeartbroken, Kya moves on.\nPart Two\nBy 1965, another guy has developed a crush on Kya.\nAnd that guy is who else if not Chase Andrews \u2013 the one with whose dead body we started off our journey.\nChase invites Kya on a picnic date, but he\u2019s just too sexually aggressive for Kya to accept his advances; so she runs off.\nHowever, Chase is stubborn and continues to pursue Kya, even taking her to the fire tower next to which his body had been found.\nFinally, he gets the girl.\nTo make matters more complicated, in the meantime, Tate \u2013 now a 23-year-old graduate \u2013 comes back for Kya.\nWe learn that he actually did the same thing five years back, but that he backed off at the final minute, realizing that Kya did not fit in with his world.\nHowever, his new realization (namely, that this was a serious mistake) comes a bit too late: after coming back from Chapel Hill, he finds out that Kya is with Chase now.\nAmong other things, Kya gives Chase a shell necklace made by her; Chase promises to treasure it as long as he lives.\nChase\u2019s mother, \n, reveals to the police that, in fact, he did just that: Chase had Kya\u2019s shell necklace on him at all times, every single day.\nHowever, the coroner reveals that it was not found on the body, making Kya a suspect, especially after one man mentions that he had seen her in the vicinity on the night of Chase\u2019s murder.\nThe police get a search warrant for her house.\nUnfortunately, inside they find a red wool hat.\nLet\u2019s cover the interim period, between Chase wooing Kya, Tate returning from Chapel Hill and the events leading up to the murder of Chase.\nA few years before the last thing happened, Chase had asked Kya\u2019s hand in marriage. Soon after, Kya was visited by Tate \u2013 who wanted, you know, to apologize and explain himself.\nHowever, during that visit, Tate noticed Kya\u2019s nature diagrams and offered to help her find a publisher. Subsequently, he did do just that, and Kya had her first book published.\nIn the meantime, she also discovers an unpleasant truth \u2013 namely, that Chase is still a ladies\u2019 men and probably engaged.\nIn 1968, another significant thing happens: Jodie, Kya\u2019s brother, returns to Barkley Cove.\nEven though her last sighting of him was when she was barely a six-year-old child, Kya recognizes him due to a scar on his face \u2013 Pa\u2019s work, of course.\nJodie returns after happening upon Kya\u2019s book; he tells her that their mother is dead, having died two years before his return.\nKya is arrested soon after Chase Andrews\u2019 murder: all the evidence points to her and the fact that Chase tried raping Kya a month before his death gives her a clear motive.\nTwo months after being put in jail, the trial of Kya begins.\nAfter her publisher testifies that he had dinner with her on the night of the murder, she is finally found not guilty, and Chase\u2019s murder is ruled an accident.\nHowever, the trial leaves Kya disillusioned with the city: Tate is the only one actually caring about her and visiting her in jail.\nKya realizes that Tate was the one all along and that she too had made a mistake.\nThe sad news about the death of Tate\u2019s father reunites the two, and they start a life together.\nWhere the Crawdads Sing Epilogue\nOf course, this is not a fairytale, so Tate and Kya do not have the luxury of living happily ever after.\nHowever, they do remain together for the next four decades when Kya passes away, aged 64; at the bequest of Tate, her headstone is inscribed thus: \u201cThe Marsh Girl.\u201d\nAfter Kya\u2019s death, Tate looks through her possessions and comes across a hidden compartment filled with many poems signed Amanda Hamilton, a popular local poet.\nAmong them, there\u2019s one describing the murder of Chase, and, inside it, Tate finds Chase\u2019s missing shell necklace.\nAmanda Hamilton was actually Kya\u2019s pseudonym, and Chase\u2019s murderer was none other than her!\nTate drops the necklace in the ocean and burns all of Kya\u2019s poems, deciding to bury the secret with him.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cWhere the Crawdads Sing PDF Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nis yet another one of those exceptional books you are more than sure should get a movie adaptation even while you read them.\nIt has everything in it: romance, murder mystery, courtroom drama, a few unexpected twists!\nUnsurprisingly, its rights have already been bought and, by the end of this year, there should be \n.\nRead the book before that: that\u2019s one decision you won\u2019t regret."},

How much of an impact do parents really have on a child\u2019s life? Did the legalization of abortion lead to a sharp decrease in crime?\nThese aren\u2019t typical questions about economics, but then Steven Levitt isn\u2019t your typical economist.\nTogether with award-winning writer and journalist Stephen Dubner, Levitt wrote\u00a0\n as a way to explore the hidden side of everything from gangs and real-estate agents to cheating and the Ku Klux Klan.\nThis is not a book about economics. Rather, it\u2019s a book that applies economic theories to other subjects. And the conclusions Levitt and Dubner come to may surprise you.\u00a0\n, in its own words, turns \u201cconventional wisdom on its head\u201d.\nINCENTIVES / FREAKONOMICS\nLevitt and Dubner argue that morality represents the way we would like the world to work, and economics shows how it actually works.\nThey explore subjects that may, at times, seem strange (it\u2019s not called\u00a0\nfor nothing) to redefine the way we look at our world.\nFrom a chapter on why the socioeconomic and racial status of parents affects how they name their children, to why parenting skills are overrated or why drug dealers have a tendency to live with their mothers, it\u2019s a fun and interesting \u2013 and sometimes controversial \u2013 read.\nAt its heart,\u00a0\n is a study of incentives \u2013 how people get what they want (or need) even when others want the same thing. And what Levitt and Dubner show above all is the importance of asking creative questions.\nIt\u2019s what made\u00a0\n an instant bestseller, and why the sometimes-controversial conclusions its authors draw are still debated today.\nCheck out our favorite nuggets from\u00a0\nbelow!\n\u201cFreakonomics Summary\u201d\nFreakonomics is a collaboration of authors Steven Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, journalists and winners of numerous awards. The authors seek to find simple answers to complicated world problems.\nFreakonomics tries to decipher everyday events from an economic perspective by exploring various events, such as drug dealers lives, the truth about real estate brokers, and the influence of parenting on children\u2019s future.\nAuthors Levitt and Dubner present the economics of daily life telling different stories with irony.\nThe authors show, through the study of incentives, how the economy influences how individuals get what they want.\nThey also explore the secret side of things and, also, question the validity of modern wisdom, presenting a valuable and different perspective, using concrete data.\nFreakonomics offers an unconventional premise: if morality shows how the world should work, economics shows how it actually works.\nFreakonomics will redefine how you see the modern world and make you question various widely held assumptions. \n?\nDoes your name influence your success? How does legalizing abortion influence a country\u2019s crime rate?\nThis book seeks to bring the answers to these questions in a way never before seen, helping you to think about other issues from another perspective.\nPeople cheat all the time, even those who say they don\u2019t cheat. \n and all kinds, who are usually honest, will resort to cheating to advance their careers or make more money if the incentive to cheat is great.\nApparently silly things, such as skip a line or stealing a point in a volleyball game, for example, may be recurring if the incentives work in favor of cheating.\nEconomists believe in the power of incentives. In fact, economics bases itself on the study of incentives.\nAn incentive is anything that induces a person to do a task or take action. \n believe that all economic problems can be solved through these incentives.\nBut they will also tell you that the solution may not please everyone. For example, a standard solution to illegal street parking is to give traffic tickets.\nThese traffic tickets are not at all popular, but they solve the problem by giving drivers an incentive not to park illegally. So an incentive can exist in many ways, not all of them positive.\nHowever, just as right encouragement can force individuals to obey the rules, the wrong incentive can encourage them to cheat. For example, in the United States, standardized school exams have become a common practice in public schools.\nWith the goal of promoting better education, the No Child Left Behind rewards schools that improve their test scores and penalizes those with failing scores.\nBecause there is a tangible benefit in achieving good test scores and (perhaps even more importantly) a distinct disadvantage in having poor results, there is a great incentive for teachers to cheat.\nSome teachers may feel tempted to substitute the wrong answers for their students\u2019 right answers, and thus their schools perform better.\nThe incentive to have good results and avoid bad ones can overcome the fear of doing something wrong or the risk of being caught.\nWhen you imagine a drug dealer, you may think of an armed person who has access to a significant amount of money. If they have that kind of money, then why do most traffickers still live with their mother?\nYou only believe that drug dealers live dangerous lives surrounded by money because you have absorbed this information from popular wisdom.\nTraditional wisdom is usually a belief, opinion or judgment about an individual issue, already accepted by society.\nThe problem is that once knowledge is recognized as popular wisdom, it is tough to correct it, even if its premise is false.\n\nSocial and economic behaviors are complex, and their understanding can be complicated. Therefore, \n that are already common.\nTraditional wisdom is usually introduced by leading thinkers or experts in a particular industry, but these experts often make their observations and assumptions without ever checking the facts.\nThese conclusions, then, are passed on to other specialists, who lend authority to the argument.\nThe answer to why a typical drug dealer still lives with his mother was discovered by Sudhir Venkatesh, who spent six years with a gang in Chicago, studying their habits.\nHe found that the reason most drug dealers still lived with their mothers was simply \n.\nThe crack cocaine trader in the gang studied by Venkatesh earned only $ 3.30 per hour, which is insufficient for his livelihood.\nSo why do they continue in this challenging and dangerous work? The answer is not financial.\nDrug gangs are like businesses: they have a pyramid-like organizational format, based on a hierarchy.\nPeople in the base of the pyramid (the street workers) have the difficult task of selling drugs and participating in gang wars, hoping that one day they will climb to the top of the pyramid, where there are big rewards.\nSo the reality is that, contrary to popular belief, drug dealers do not make much money. That shows that what most people believe to be the truth may not always be the case.\nCrime in the U.S.A. has dropped significantly in the 1990s. Several factors are associated with this decline, including an increase in the number of police officers, an increase in penalties for criminals and a change in the drug market.\nBut what about abortion? Could legalizing abortion be a contributing factor to this decline?\nNicolae Ceausescu became a dictator in Romania in 1966. A year later, he made abortion illegal. He thought it could make Romania stronger by increasing the population of the country.\nThe only women who were allowed to abort were those who already had four children and those in a high position in the Communist Party.\nThe pressure on women was so intense that government officials forced them to take pregnancy tests on the job. Women who did not get pregnant were forced to pay a celibacy tax.\nWithin a year, the birth rate in Romania doubled. Under the dictatorial regime of Nicolae Ceausescu, ordinary people of Romania lived a miserable life.\nHowever, the consequences were worse for children born after the abortion ban: they were worse off than those born a year earlier, including their schooling achievements and their success at work.\nAfter abortion became illegal in Romania, more children were born in poverty and were, therefore, more likely to engage in criminal activity.\nIf the ban on abortion can lead to increased crime, it is not difficult to apply the same logic to explain why crime is declining in the United States.\nIt may be that there are fewer unwanted children. \n have access to abortion, children who are born have better prospects in life and are less likely to engage in crime for economic reasons.\nReal estate brokers make a lot of money at the expense of asymmetric informational. They need to use insider information \n to buy or sell real estate. Consider for a moment that you want to sell your home.\nSelling a home is not a routine transaction, and you may not know much about the real estate market. One of your biggest problems will be the price of the house.\nIf you assign a meager price on your home, you may not get the money you deserve. But if your price is too high, your home may not be sold. So, what do you do?\nIn this scenario, your best option is to contact a broker. Before the emergence of the Internet, they were the only ones who had information on the real estate market.\nThey were in a good position to advise you on the home\u2019s current market value.\nHowever, they could also manipulate this information in their favor, to make their customers afraid of losing a good sale if they delayed.\nNowadays, thanks to the Internet, buyers and \n.\nThey have become clients with much more knowledge, and the result is that the broker\u2019s advantage has diminished considerably.\nIn the same way, life insurance companies made a lot of money before the arrival of the Internet. In the past, customers had no way of knowing if the companies were offering the best prices or the best policies.\nTherefore, the cost of life insurance was very high. When the Internet began offering comparisons between plans, customers were able to find cheaper policies quickly.\nThat has increased competition among insurance companies, which has caused prices to fall.\nWe see then that the power and influence of insurance companies or real estate companies depend on exclusive information. When exclusivity no longer exists, their power reduces or disappears.\nCompare the story of two children. One is a white boy and the other a black kid. The white boy\u2019s parents have high school degrees, and the father has a good job.\nHis mother is a housewife and holds a university degree. The boy lives a happy life and does well in high school.\nThe black boy\u2019s mother abandoned him when he was two. His father has a good job in retail, but he drinks a lot and often hits the kid when he\u2019s drunk. One day the boy sees his father beating a woman.\nShe is beaten so badly that she loses some of her teeth. The kid does not do well in high school, starts selling drugs and gets in trouble often.\nHe makes sure to be in his bed before his father comes home from work and leaves the house before his father wakes up in the morning.\nEventually, his father is arrested for sexual assault. At twelve, the boy needs to support himself.\nWhat do you think will happen to these two boys? How will their future be? \n.\nIt does not matter if the child was taken to museums, was given timeout when he did something wrong or if he had a television.\nThat does not mean that parenting is not important, but the fact is that when parents finally learn what is right for their children, it is too late.\nHow your child will do in the future depends on factors decided many years before, such as your identity, the person you marry, and the kind of life you have.\nSmart, educated, hard-working, well-paid individuals who marry such people are also more likely to have successful children. Being honest, kind and curious, also helps. For your kids to succeed, it does not depend so much on what you do when you are a parent, but on who you are.\nIn 1958, a New York resident named Robert Lane had a son. He decided to call his son \u201cWinner\u201d (Winner). Three years later, he had another child and called him \u201cLoser\u201d (Loser). What do you think happened to the boys?\nLoser Lane has achieved success in his life. He attended a preparatory school with a scholarship, went to Pennsylvania\u2019s Lafayette University and later joined the New York police force. He was promoted to detective and eventually to sergeant.\nHis older brother, Winner, also stood out, but in the wrong way. The only thing he got was a long criminal record.\nSo the question arises: does a child\u2019s name influence their eventual economic success? The answer is \u201cno.\u201d\nA child\u2019s name does not affect how they will perform in the future. \n.\nOtherwise, why bother raising your kids the right way? And it is true that most parents will name their kids thinking about the success they will achieve in the future.\nNote that there is also a random effect that influences both the best and the worst parents.\nAs a result, there are devout and intelligent parents who have children who are unsuccessful, just as there are successful children regardless of their parents\u2019 terrible habits and intentions (such as naming their child \u201cLoser\u201d).\nTo demonstrate this, let\u2019s go back a bit. Do you remember the two boys from the previous session? These kids had very different beginnings in life.\nThe black boy is Roland G. Fryer Jr, a famous economist, while the white boy is Ted Kaczynski, the serial killer known as \u201cUnabomber.\u201d Looking at their education, we certainly would not have foreseen it.\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free\u00a0\n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cFreakonomics\u201d Quotes\nFinal Notes:\nFreakonomics questions common principles and brings unusual answers. It has been proved, for example, that teachers cheat when incentives outweigh the risks of being caught.\nBefore the Internet arrived, insurance companies and real estate brokers were both very successful because they had privileged information.\nContrary to popular belief, drug dealers do not make a lot of money and live miserable lives.\nThe right to an abortion caused crime to fall because mothers had the choice of whether or not to have a baby and children were born with better standards of living.\nWhen it comes to parenting, it is more important who the parents are than what they do.\nLevitt and Dubner have shown that data is relevant, that incentives guide modern society and that collective wisdom may not have any basis at all.\nThey also argue that economic principles can be applied to everyday problems. Freakonomics features several pearls of wisdom, providing a new insight and understanding of everyday problems."},

And Why?\nWhile reading, we were positively shocked to hear about the importance of getting the timing right. Most often, we take this to be a trivial and less important thing to be worried about, but the facts paint a different picture.\nApparently, it\u2019s absurd to designate a leader who could head-up this whole initiative.\nWith that said \u201c\n\u201d is clearly a must-have or better must-read for everyone who wants to go through the aspects of human psychology.\nThese tendencies vary on a case to case basis but are a great reminder of how people behave and react at different stages of life.\nAbout Daniel H. Pink\n is a revolutionary within the confines of biology and psychology and was the co-executive producer of the National Geographic Channel.\nHe mainly covers topics that revolve around business, behavioral science and psychology.\nAmongst other things, he is a best-selling author according to the New York Times Magazine.\n\u201cWhen PDF Summary\u201d\nMichael Macy and Scott Golder, professors from Cornell University, conducted a comprehensive study regarding human emotional patterns. They analyzed more than 500 million tweets, coming from every corner of the world and came to a startling discovery. \nIt was the consistency that left them shocked not the discrepancy as one might have guessed. According to the study, tweeters were displaying energetic and enthusiastic behavior in the morning and experienced a deteriorating mood in the afternoon; while in the evenings, they\u2019d normally perk up.\nThe tweeter\u2019s background or religious beliefs had nothing to do with this flow. \nNearly three centuries before this sociological breakthrough, scientists have already explained or established the biological clock theory. \nIt was predicated on the understanding that all living things, regardless of their structure, have it. \nThe DRM (Day Reconstruction Method) designed by behavioral scientists provides us with more data and tracks hour-to-hour mood changes.\nBritish and Swedish professors compiled a list of questions that ultimately became the first test designed to measure our internal clock system.\nThis was later improved at the hands of distinguished chrono-biologists Martha Merrow and Till Roenneberg. \nThey coined a few terms to explain how our body functions during the 24-hour time frame: Larks, Third Birds, Owls.\nIt may seem complex and very misleading at first glance, but let\u2019s dig up a bit. \nTo understand their perspective on human behavior, you have to answer the following questions:\nOn the chart below you can get a glimpse into how humans are categorized regarding this matter:\nThe lion\u2019s share goes to \n. \nMost of us actually fall into this category, because we are on neither side of the extremes. In a practical sense, this indicates that you go to bed somewhere between 11-12PM, and wake up at around 7-9AM. \nGenetics also argues that people on the extremes are not made, as many would assume, but born. \nFor Thomas Edison, his fellow scientists often said: \nAccording to Daniel Pink, age is also one of the driving factors that determine one\u2019s chronotype. For example, teenagers tend to be leaning more towards Owls, and that\u2019s not surprising. Their midpoint in sleep is around 6-7AM, while most parents fall into larks. \nWhen it comes to the sexes, men and women also slightly differ in this regard.\nAccording to the study, men tilt toward eveningness, while women toward morningness.\nSo that would cover the basic behavior tendencies that we as humans tend to nurture, both consciously and unconsciously.\nThere\u2019s a dilemma going around:\nHow to figure out our daily \u201cWHEN.\u201d\nThe most straightforward would be by adhering to the three-step method.\nDaniel advises you to track your behavior on a weekly basis. Hence, you need to answer these three questions every ninety minutes:\nYou can use your smartphone, or whatever device you have at your disposal to set up an alarm clock and follow the exercise.\nLet\u2019s give this task the benefit of the doubt, and ponder about the difficulty of optimizing your schedule.\nIt\u2019s impossible to make it flawless, and it\u2019s not advisable to circumvent the issue. \nSo, the one thing you can do is minimize the adverse effects by:\nThey say: Each morning is a new chance to fulfill your dreams. \nIn addition to that, let\u2019s list four tips for getting the most out of this very despised time of day:\nDaniel believes that the emotional and cognitive aspects of our lives are the ones that deserve the attention. With that said, it\u2019s utterly destructive to neglect the physical element by labeling it as insignificant.\nHe encourages people to do a bit of morning exercising, and states the reason:\nPeople openly argue about the need for good night\u2019s rest, and how to define the perfect bedtime. Nowadays, when productivity is regarded as the most valuable gem, and society struggles to adhere to this principle, mapping out a plan seems like the only option.\n\u2013 Find the best time to take a nap (ideally between 2.pm and 3. pm)\n\u2013 Find a peaceful place\n\u2013 Drink a cup of coffee before you decide to catch forty winks\n\u2013 Set a timer (30 minutes nap is the perfect time to reinvigorate yourself)\n\u2013 Rinse and repeat\nIn chapter 3, Daniel addresses the issue of marriage.\nIt comes as no surprise that people have this natural urge for reproduction, and science is clear on this. So, the question which raises many eyebrows is \u2013 When is the perfect time to tie the knot?\nHere are three general guidelines that you ought to follow:\nIn 2010, Nobel Prize-winning economist Angus Deaton teamed up with four social scientists and created the age distribution curve of well-being. They interviewed approximately 340,000 people and got the following results:\nWe get the impression of a U-curve that slightly slumps in the middle and goes back up again. \nThe same applies to both sexes, and the differences are literally non-existent with regard to life-happiness over the years. Numerous studies conducted in the aftermath of this revelation only validated the deep-rooted theory.\nThe most shocking piece of the puzzle was the fact that even monkeys exhibit the same mood or well-being trajectory. Zookeepers and animal researchers used advanced techniques to get to the bottom of this phenomenon.\nThe question is, how to cheer up after a midlife slump?\nIs there something we can do?\nIn fact, there are five steps that when implemented correctly could invigorate you:\nBruce Tuckman, an organizational psychologist, refined a theory which showed how groups progressed through time:\nBren\u00e9 Brown presents an all-encompassing definition of midlife:\nBut you are entitled to a response and here\u2019s what you should do:\nLet\u2019s look at a case.\nIn the early 1930s, Mildred Marie Wilson gave birth to a boy \u2013 James Byron Dean. Jimmy enjoyed a happy life, as his family moved from Indiana to Southern Carolina right about the time he was starting at school.\nA couple of years later, his mom died of cancer, and Jimmy\u2019s father sent him back to live with his relatives.\nHe finished high-school and was raised in the traditional American spirit. \nIn 1951, he dropped out of UCLA, to pursue an acting career. He was lucky to secure a couple of commercial and TV roles at such a young age. \nAt the age of 23, he was cast in the film adaptation of a John Steinbeck novel.\nThe movie quickly became a blockbuster and got him a nomination for an Oscar. That same year, he even landed a bigger role, which earned him the Oscar.\nFour months before his 25\n birthday, James Dean died in a car accident. \nDaniel Pink tries to ascertain which of the following scenarios is better:\nAccording to researchers, people tend to rate higher the Jimmy scenario \u2013 pointing to an upturn.\nIn all honesty, our lives are not always dramatic, but they do entail turmoil and challenges. \nWith that said, Daniel Pink believes that the life-curve unfolds as a three-act drama:\nKey Lessons from \u201cWhen\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \u201cWhen\u201d is not rigid\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nurture ideas that can sustain you\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thrust through life\nThe \u201cWhen\u201d is not rigid\nEven though we listed a couple of universal truths, that doesn\u2019t mean that you cannot influence your personal \u201cWhen.\u201d\nAnd yes, it\u2019s not as straightforward as many people assume to get an aerial view of how things unfold.\nBut, it\u2019s great to start from the hurdles that block your path to enlightenment in the mattering question.\nNurture ideas that can sustain you\nThe key in life is to learn and mature inwardly. \nIf the focus is predominately placed on your well-being, then you have to be very careful with regards to the mindset you cultivate.\nAs a matter of fact, people often cling to worthless ideas, that produce disastrous results in the long-haul. \nThrust Through Life\nWhomsoever told you that life is fair and smooth, lied to you. \nIt may come as a shock to you, but today\u2019s generation is all about fairness, which is a meaningless concept if you don\u2019t attach some substantial weight to it.\nSo, we hate to say it, but you\u2019d be better off if you understand the challenges that may come your way.\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free \n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cWhen Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nBeing completely immersed in doing something, is undoubtedly the way to surmount the obstacles.\nWe kind of get the idea that any game is beatable if you are apprised of the facts and shortcuts.\nIn addition, we extracted the key takeaways from this book in an attempt to root out misleading agendas that permeate society.

In \n\u00a0he admits that, had it not been for writing courses, they would have never met.\nShe\u2019s his Ideal Reader, from whom he gets most of his advice. He sees something in her that he also sees in himself: he does what he knows, and also knows how to do it.\n\u201cOn Writing PDF Summary \u2013 Stephen King\u201d\nThe author attempts to show how one writer was formed \u2013 himself. Like most good story ideas, Stephen King came out of nowhere.\nAccording to the book writing is telepathy because writers are made for writing the truth \u2013 at least, the best ones are. Stephen King claims that one can only write from his or her own experiences.\nAs long as experiences are gained from honest, real situations, readers will seek to find characters that mirror their own lives. And this is where telepathy begins, according to King.\nThe door must be closed while a person writes, and open if the same individual rewrites. Your struggle begins with you \u2013 within you, afterward, it is advisable to take that battle somewhere else.\nWhat is the most important rule when writing a book to which the author of \u201c\n\u201d Stephen King refers to? Simply accuracy.\nTake this situation for example \u2013 How would you feel if you find out \u2013 the story or facts that you are reading are inaccurate? You already know the answer to this question.\nThere is one funny anecdote \u2013 To be a writer, you must have a very boring life. However, being a writer doesn\u2019t make you an introvert. This book summary covers the most important parts of the book, which according to our team can make a lot of difference.\nLife is one of those terms that humans still haven\u2019t figure it out its definition. Writing is not just a part of life; it is life. You cannot underestimate its power by identifying it with some sort of support system; it has to take all the credit. Think of it like any other art \u2013 writing is truly a gift from our ancestors.\n is also a so-called driving license for creating good works. It differs from typical writing guidebooks because it\u2019s filled with the author\u2019s own memories and experiences. There is also a chapter called \u201cC.V.\u201d, which introduces the reader to his \nand\u00a0gives ideas on \n.\nThe chapter \u201cWhat Writing Is\u201d deals with King\u2019s main concept: a book is more valuable if the reader can find similarities to his or her own life. In order to create this telepathy, the writer should have all the tools.\nThe next chapter, \u201cToolbox\u201d, gives you a hint of what to put into practice. This means lots of practice. Grammar is not always enough. \n.\nThe main chapter, entitled \u201cOn Writing\u201d, describes the job of a writer: write what you see. King compares writing to mathematics, except here the formula is \nFeel free to use words that you might never find in dictionaries; the same applies to long words. But never complicate things: \u201cNever use \u2018emolument\u2019 when you mean \u2018tip\u201d.\nStephen King has a good sense of humor. I think it\u2019s mostly because he writes what he thinks. One of my favorite quotes is: \u201cIf your master\u2019s thesis is no more organized than a high school essay titled \n, you\u2019re in big trouble\u201d.\nAnd the biggest question is always whether your story is coherent. King says you should never use difficult words written in baroque style.\nWhenever you meet a dead-end, remind yourself: \nIf we know how to handle our tools, we know how to write. King believes you should never start a book with questions. However, there is something special about a book that makes you hungry for answers from the very start. The best books reflect the readers\u2019 lives.\nWe learn from our own mistakes. Even best-selling authors get it wrong sometimes; what makes them successful is that they learn from the experience, and improve their craft in the process.\nThe last chapter, entitled \u201cOn Living: A Postscript\u201d\nis written from the author\u2019s personal view and experience. King encourages the reader to do one thing: be brave and start writing.\nThere are many unpublished books that ought to see the light of day, but whose authors are too afraid to publish them. One has to be brave, \n of what other people may say or think.\nFrom my personal point of view, I think all masterpieces reflect the creator. You can only share something if you have something to share. That requires a lot of reading and a lot of writing. Without any practice, you cannot improve your skills.\nIt\u2019s also about the style and shape and length of the work. King considers the paragraph the most important part of writing, instead of the sentence.\nEveryone is free to think and decide for themselves because it\u2019s the only way to learn and improve ourselves.\nWe sometimes do not understand life and its negative aspects, but everyone reaches a point when all the pieces fall together. I do believe that everything happens for a reason.\nThe paths that lead us to success might be full of dead ends.

Our Outliers Summary will give you the hint on that one.\nBe a hard-worker; \n \u2013be at the right place at the right time.\nWe put all critical elements in a nutshell and present it in this comprehensive book summary!\nWho Should Read \u201cOutliers\u201d? And Why?\nAbout Malcolm Gladwell\n \n\u201cOutliers PDF Summary\u201d\nLet\u2019s assume that you want to join the Junior Canadian Hockey League. Your goal is to become a really successful hockey player. You should also know that in Canada the eligibility cutoff for age-class is January 1\n.\nThat means that if you turn 9 on January the 2\n, you will be playing the whole year with 8-year-old colleagues. This gives you a huge advantage over your friend that will turn 9 in December, for example.\nYou have one year advantage in physical strength, speed, accuracy and you will probably be seen as one of the \u201ctalented\u201d ones.\nThis gives you higher chances of being selected to play in one of the bigger teams in the region. Where the story will repeat, and you will be selected to play in the Major Junior A team.\n(function(d,id){if(d.getElementById(id))return;var scr=d.createElement(\u2018script\u2019);scr.src=\u2019https://widget.\n.com/v0.2.0/widget.js\u2019;scr.id=id;d.body.appendChild(scr);})(document,\u201912min-widget-sdk\u2019);window.twelveminInit=function twelveminInit(){};\n\nIn this case, even the month you were born has a major impact on your success. The author adds it perfectly.\nMalcolm Gladwell spent the majority of his time analyzing and searching for theories which were a complete opposite of the collective societal opinion. He also criticized the U.S educational system, alluding to many weakness which the government just ignores.\n\u201cOutliers\u201d as the name indicates is a paranormal book according to some people, although this may seem like a negative comment \u2013 it is not.\nWhere is the beauty of typical behavior? \u2013 We assist Gladwell in the battle against mediocracy, and you should start that fight too.\nIn one of Gladwell\u2019s recent speeches, he declared that \u2013 People\u2019s opinion about success is imposed. We lack individuals; we have a society. Hard work, ambition, struggle are not the only elements of success. \n has a task to clarify this mystery by introducing the readers to lots of variable measurements of professional or personal prosperity.\nNo one dares to admit that even the wealthy people are often depressive \u2013 so are you calling that a success?\nOur culture has a tremendous impact on our behavior; we mustn\u2019t allow getting ourselves trapped in the circle of nations. Be a person of the world \u2013 see things clearly and let Gladwell and \n guide you.\nIn football is the same. If you want to reinforce this idea, just try a Google search on your national under-19 football team. Count how many players are born in the first half of the year, and how many in the second.\n By the time the computer revolution came around 1975, one should have been old enough to be part of it, but not too young to miss it. Ideally one should have been 20 or 21.\nBill Gates was born on October 28, 1955. \u201cGates is the hockey player born on January 1\n.\u201d\nThe book is split into two parts.\nThe first one is called \u201cOpportunity\u201d. In its chapters, it describes in more detail the previously given examples and many other.\nHe also refers to a rule called \n. It\u2019s the magical number that every successful person invested in achieving success. In any field, with no exception.\nThe chapter \u201cThe trouble with the geniuses\u201d will answer the \u201cWhy?\u201d to the question related to the IQ from the beginning. In order for someone to achieve success, a high IQ or practical intelligence it\u2019s not enough.\nThere is something else called the \nThe second part is called \n In its chapters, the author describes why our backgrounds are important and can be a prediction of one\u2019s success.\nWhy coming from a Jewish family that immigrated to the USA, had a big influence on you becoming a well-known lawyer.\nIn \u201cHarlan, Kentucky\u201d you will understand why traditions and attitudes, which we inherit from our forebears, can have a huge influence on success even after 100 years.\nThe typical myth of Asians being better at solving math problems was also revealed. It all comes down to how they express numbers. Let\u2019s think of a simple but revealing example.\nIf in English we use eleven, twelve for 11 and 12, the Chinese use a much easier system: they transform them into ten-one, ten-two.\nFor twenty, thirty they use two-tens, three-tens. When it comes to adding, they don\u2019t need to make the conversion in their head from the word to a number.\nThey have directly the number, and therefore arithmetical computations are easier.\nWith this advantage, an Asian child of 4 years old can count to 40 already, while an American child can count only to 15.\nOnly at age 5, he will be able to count until 40, being one year behind the Asian with the basic math skills. As it was described before, with this small advantage, he will gain more.\nMany other interesting questions are answered by the author using this book, for example:\nWithout a doubt, the answer to all these questions should be known by now. It is Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s \u201cWhy?\u201d that keeps you reading and gets your attention until the last page.\nIt is there where he also concludes that\nKey Lessons from \u201cOutliers\u201d\nFace violence openly, let your actions speak for itself\nAnything can happen in the air\nHard work beats intelligence\n\u201cOutliers Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review"},

It is almost a noun as \u201capple\u201d.\u00a0Or \u201ccomputer\u201d.\u00a0Or \u201c\n\u201c.\u00a0Or whatever noun you may be thinking of. You heard it a thousand times and you think you\u00a0know what it really means without a\u00a0preliminary lesson. And as every respectable noun, he\u00a0arouses curiosity:\u00a0what are his roots? When was he the subject or when was he only a direct complement?\nBIOGRAPHY/ STEVE JOBS\nUnderstanding and communicating the life of Steve Jobs is a challenge. Making the Steve Jobs summary wasn\u2019t any easier. Steve was such a genius that he chose a biographer to the height.\nAfter the cancer diagnosis which eventually led to his death, Walter Isaacson was the chosen biographer.\n\u201cSteve Jobs Summary\u201d\nHe already had in his portfolio no less than biographies of Albert Einstein and Benjamin Franklin, and to fulfil the mission, he interviewed Steve on more than 40 occasions for 2 years, as well as more than 100 friends, relatives, competitors, and co-workers.\nJobs biography is a collection of fantastic stories, through the ups and downs of his career, his passion and perfectionism and the revolution of six major industries: personal computing, animation cinema, music, e-books, mobile phones, and tablets.\nJobs was an inventive genius who knew that the 21st century was based on connecting technology and creativity. Steve cooperated with the book, but he did not interfere in any way. In fact, he did not even read the book before its publication and encouraged all interviewees to be sincere and transparent.\nHis story, captured succinctly in this summary, is a fantastic tale of innovation, character, \n, and values.\nZen, Critic, and ill-behaved\nThose who knew Steve Jobs as a child may not have imagined that he would reach the top of the business world by founding and leading the most valuable company in the world.\nBorn in February 1955, the son of a \n father named Abdulfattah and a Catholic mother named Joanne, he was put up for donation because his father did not share his mother\u2019s Catholic religion.\nHe was adopted by Paul, an engineer who worked as a mechanic and Clara Jobs. Living in Silicon Valley, a rich environment for technology experiments, Steve was introduced to the world of engineering and design by his own adoptive father.\nDespite being welcomed by his parents, he fought throughout his life against feelings of abandonment. The Steve boy was extremely precocious, impertinent and intelligent. Proof of his daring is that when he was 13, he phoned Bill Hewlett, Hewlett-Packard\u2019s president to order electronic components for a school project.\nWorking with his father, he learned to be proud of his work and to be thorough.\nFrom childhood, he had already demanded the perfection of himself and the people around him. As a teenager, Jobs became interested in the computer world and the \n that spilt over into the Valley at that time.\nSteve experimented with drugs like LSD and other psychedelics, and later he would attribute \n to these drugs. For Steve, his experiences with LSD helped him to understand what mattered in life and to see other perspectives on the world.\nIn addition to his interest in altered consciousness, Steve was also interested in spirituality. He walked barefoot and rarely bathed and followed his growing interest in spiritual philosophies spending seven months in India, where he learned more about intuition and introspection.\nAt first, he embraced the possibilities of computing, much more for his potential to raise human consciousness than for his business or commercial applications. But the Zen influences failed to soften his increasingly \n.\nOne Apple day\nSteve Wozniak was a timid electronic nerd who shared with Steve the taste for Bob Dylan\u2019s classics. They invented a device called the \u201cBlue Box\u201d that mimicked the wrists of a telephone line and allowed people to hack into the telephone system, making free calls.\n was superior to Jobs technically, but Jobs had the determination and the spirit to market the products. Woz invented and Jobs sold.\nAfter visiting a farm, Jobs imagined that \u201cApple\u201d was a gentle and simple name. With only $ 1,300 in 1976, \n. In Jobs\u2019s garage, he and Woz worked together and created the Apple, their first personal computer and their second version, the Apple II.\nThe Apple I consisted of a case with a built-in keyboard that plugged into a TV and software that would allow the end consumer to operate a computer. With this, they managed to take the computing from the world of nerds to put it in the house of people.\nWozniak developed the circuit boards as Jobs linked computing power to a friendly packaging that represented his obsession with perfection. In just 30 days being marketed, the Apple I was already becoming profitable. For the Apple II, the project was more audacious and perfectionist.\nBut Steve was rude and rude to his employees. He seemed not to \n and focused only on the details of the product itself.\nGiven his imbalances and emotional instabilities, Mike Scott was appointed the president of Apple Computer, and eventually, there were conflicts between employees and Jobs, who had to be mediated by Scott.\nSteve\u2019s obsession was so great that he came to reject more than 2,000 shades of beige for the Apple II box and Scott had to decide at the end. Steve also insisted on offering a one-year consumer warranty when the industry standard was 90 days.\nWhen his colleagues confronted him, Jobs screamed, spoke and sometimes even cried, but he always got what he wanted. His closest collaborators learned how to deal with him, but he was a master of manipulation, always trying to do everything his way.\nBut the company was doing so well that this situation ended up being tolerated internally.\nThe Apple II has sold 6 million copies and is considered one of the cornerstones of personal computing. For Steve, that was not enough. He wanted to build a computer that would leave a mark on the universe.\nSo Jobs began working on the Macintosh, the successor to the Apple II that would lead him to stardom.\nThe impetus for further action prompted Jobs to assemble a renegade team of \u201cpirates\u201d inside the company to compete internally with the Apple team that was building the computer Lisa (named after the illegitimate daughter Jobs first was reluctant to acknowledge, but later welcomed).\nThe Macintosh was not a unique creation of Jobs, in fact, \n) from others, but the project gave life to a machine that was powerful enough to display sophisticated graphics and be controlled by a mouse.\nThe Macintosh was an absolute success especially due to the TV campaign of the commercial called \u201c1984\u201d, directed by famous Hollywood director Ridley Scott. The commercial was so successful that sales exploded and everyone came to know Steve Jobs.\nHe got interviews in every major magazine manipulating journalists as if he were giving them an exclusive.The Macintosh made Steve rich and famous, but his personality was eroding the company.\nHis oppressive and perfectionist behaviour was making the employees feel disenchanted and depressed. This behaviour caused his dismissal from Apple by its board in 1985.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nAfter recovering from his resignation from his own company, Jobs noticed that he could now do things his own way. His first project was a computer for the educational market called NeXT. With Next, he resumed his passion for design.\nHe invested more than $ 100,000 just for the company logo and wanted the computer to be in the form of a perfect cube, but that made manufacturing costs too expensive.\nThe NeXT almost broke, the launch was delayed in years and in the end, the product was too expensive for the consumer. Its high cost and the lack of availability of software caused the project to fail.\nAt the same time, Jobs bought control of a company called Pixar. As chairman of the board, he created a strategy that combined technology and art. In 1988, Jobs had already lost tens of millions at Next and invested $ 50 million in Pixar.\nPixar released a movie called \u201cTin Toy\u201d that won the award for best animation and this made Jobs shift its focus to the animated film business. Eventually, Pixar partnered with Disney and released their first movie, Toy Story, which became the most profitable film of the year 1996.\nPixar made an IPO, and Steve\u2019s stock was then valued at $ 1.2 billion.\nSteve in family\nIn addition to his new business, Jobs tried to reconcile his personal life, reconnecting with his biological family.\nIn 1986 after the death of his adoptive mother, he met his biological mother. He was surprised to learn that she had a sister who was artistic and temperamental and they became close.\nAt the same time, he met his future wife, Laurene Powell, with whom he married in 1991. The couple had two children, Erin and Eve. With Laurene\u2019s encouragement, Jobs also spent more time with his daughter Lisa, who was as temperamental as Jobs.\nIn some cases, they would remain months without speaking. In private as well as in his professional life, Jobs was either very passionate or extremely distant.\nA new Apple\nAfter Jobs left, Apple fell into decline. In 1996 Gil Amelio \n, and he wanted to bring new ideas to restore the company. In 1997, he bought Next and made Jobs an advisor to Apple. Once back at Apple, Steve took as much control as he could. He put his favourite NeXT employees in the highest positions at Apple.\nThe company was not doing well, and the board decided to give Jobs a new chance as CEO. But Jobs declined the invitation.\nHe preferred to retain his advisor status to gain more influence in the company. He managed \n to develop Office for Mac and thus ended the battle between companies.\nThe stock price of Apple took off, and after some time, he finally accepted the invitation to become CEO of the company again. By taking over, his focus became unique. Focus the company on making fewer products. And so he worked to save Apple. The mantra of his administration was \u201cFocus.\u201d\nHe rejected entire product lines, fired irrelevant employees and cut the whole stockpiles. Jobs had transformed himself from a free-spirited corporate rebel to a uniquely dedicated, collaborative yet volatile executive.\nHe believed in \u201cdeep collaboration\u201d between departments and in engaging and cultivating \u201cA-players\u201d, high-level talents.\nThus, a potential marketing engagement had to be hounded by designers and software engineers. \u201cSimultaneous Engineering\u201d meant that the products under development went through simultaneous reviews of manufacturing, design, marketing, and distribution, rather than going through each area sequentially.\nThis ensured that everyone had a stake in the development and creation of new products. Jobs hired Tim Cook to run operations, and the two connected and quickly became friends. Cook would eventually help Jobs lead Apple.\nThe strategy worked: Apple, which was 90 days from insolvency, turned a loss of $ 1 billion in 1997 to a profit of $ 309 million a year later.\nThe field of reality distortion\nJobs had a strange ability to persuade people \n. He demanded what others considered impossible. Thus, glimpsing the impossible, he made things happen and changed reality.\nHe focused so intensely on what interested him that he sometimes ignored everything else, including his wife, Laureen, their children \u2013 Reed, Erin and Eve, Lisa \u2013 and their family and friends. Steve was cruel and extremely critical of others and his work, but even so, \n.\nHe never clung to material possessions, living in unfurnished homes, but his passion for products made Apple a giant.\nJobs believed that the rules did not apply to him. The man who refused to put plates in his cars and parked in places reserved for disabled people invented products that consumers did not even know they wanted but for which they soon fell in love.\nDesign in all the aspects\nSteve Jobs learned the importance of design quality with his father who taught him how to make beautiful the hidden sides of a cabinet mattered as much as creating an elegant front. From his forays into the Eastern philosophies, Jobs understood that product design was at its core.\nHe met a designer named Jony Ive, who became his right-hand man and # 2 at Apple.\nMr Jobs elevated these concepts to the point where he believed the presentation of Apple products could convey as much meaning as the products themselves. Even packaging was crucial. Jobs got so involved in the design minutiae that his name appears on several patents of Apple products.\n of the public when Apple introduced the iMac in 1998. Quickly the computer developed along with Jony Ive became the computer that sold fastest in history.\nThe round, fun-looking computer came with a semi-transparent coating and was available in five colours. Jobs made the interior as attractive as the exterior.\nWhen Apple extended the range of colours, Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates painted his PC in red and mocked that the iMac would be a fad.\nIn addition to the obsession with design, Jobs wanted to control the entire distribution chain. Hence came the idea of having your own physical presence, the Apple Store. The first Apple Store came in 2001 and was a great success.\nToday, Apple Stores are still the result of the almost \n of Jobs. Computers were different, but retailers generally did not focus on explaining differences to buyers. Jobs wanted to manage the consumer experience, just as he had influenced all other aspects of computer design and production.\nTherefore, he resolved to design sales points with the same taste he brought for everything else. He insisted on expensive and busy places. He patented the design of the titanium and glass staircases of the stores. He wanted more than a store.\nHe wanted a customer experience that was associated with the spirit of Apple products.\nMore than just computers\nJobs took the \u201cTop 100\u201d employees (the ones he would choose to put on a \u201clifeboat and take to his next company\u201d) at an annual retreat to discuss Apple\u2019s future. In 2000, the company\u2019s transformation began.\nThe personal computer evolved into a digital cube that could manage the consumer\u2019s digital lifestyle, from written communications to cameras, music players, and video recording.\nApple removed the word \u201cComputers\u201d from its corporate name to explore the potential of the internet to connect and integrate these different aspects. For example, iTunes grew out of Jobs\u2019s perception that downloading music over the internet would change the music industry: the iTunes store sold a million songs in the first six days.\nThe iPod resulted from the need for a better music \n, the scroll wheel is included. The success of the iPod, built on the sales of the iMac, consolidated the brand. In January 2007, the iPod accounted for half of Apple\u2019s revenue.\nStill, Jobs kept looking for the next big release. Identifying cell phone as the next wave, he left a new mark on the universe and unveiled the iPhone, combining iPod, telephony and internet access. It alone accounted for more than 50% of total global cellphone profits in the year 2010.\nThe idea of a tablet predated the iPhone, but in 2010 experiments with the iPhone paved the way for the next revolutionary item: the iPad. In the case of the iPad, Apple sold 1 million units in the first month and reached 15 million in just 9 months.\nBattling cancer\nJobs believed that his cancer, diagnosed in 2003, \n he experienced when he led Apple and Pixar in the late 1990s. Treatment for kidney stones led to an examination that discovered his cancer.\nEven so, the prognosis was good; the tumour was treatable and slow-growing. However, Jobs rejected medical recommendations for surgery. He consulted nutritionists, acupuncturists, followed vegetarian diets, underwent colon cleanings and banished negativity from his thoughts.\nIn 2005, he made mention of his mortality in a graduation speech at Stanford University. Jobs told the trainees, \u201cRemembering that I will be dead soon is the most important tool I have found to help me \n \u2026 There is no reason not to follow your heart.\u201d\n\u201cSteve Jobs Quotes\u201d\nFinal Notes\nSteve Jobs has transformed industries, invented new forms of communication, put the world at your fingertips, and made it fun, intelligent and cool. His belief that the product was everything guided Apple\u2019s philosophy and its focus on how the consumer would perceive and use those products.\nJobs felt, just like his idol Edwin Lan of Polaroid, that he was in the \u201cintersection of the arts with science.\u201d Like Walt Disney, Jobs wanted to leave a company that contributed to society and represented more than just profits.\nHe recognized that his personality was difficult and that his behaviour was sometimes cruel but believed that being honest was the only way to give his best and extract the best from those around him.\nYou may also be wondering how Walter Isaacson came to the idea of writing this biography.\nThe truth is\u2026that this idea wasn\u2019t of \n at all.\n\u201cIt turned out that he wanted me to write a biography of him.[\u2026] in 2009 his wife Lauren Powell said bluntly: \u201cIf you\u2019re ever going to do a book on Steve, you\u2019d better do it now\u201d[\u2026] he had called me right before going to be operated on for cancer.\u201d\nBut he didn\u2019t want this \n\u00a0book for his own recap. It was just another thing he wanted to leave behind.\n\u201d <It\u2019s your book>he said <I won\u2019t ever read it>\u201d\nThis is just a teasing. Take a look at this 30 great nuggets from\u00a0Walter Isaacson\u2019s book \u2013 \u00a0"},

And Why?\nIf you think your life is a mess \n \u2013 or sometimes precisely because of that \u2013 then you have to both check out \nand really conduct the experiment yourself.\nAlso, as a \nreview notes, \u201cif you liked Sharyl Sandberg\u2019s \nread Janice Kaplan\u2019s \n.\u201d\nAbout Janice Kaplan\n is an American writer, editor, and producer.\nKaplan began her career as a sports reporter at CBS Radio and sports writer for the \nmagazine; her first book \u2013 published soon after she graduated magna cum laude from Yale \u2013 was sports-related as well, as suggested by the straightforward title, \n.\nAfterward, she moved on to write ten novels, the last one published soon after she became the editor-in-chief of the \nmagazine, a position she held until 2010.\nSince then, she has published three more books, all of them non-fiction.\nFind out more at \n \n\u201cThe Gratitude Diaries PDF Summary\u201d\nThe Pitfalls of Comparing Yourself to Others\nUnfortunately, most of us are unhappy with our lives; there\u2019s always something more than what we have that we strive for, something extra we desperately want.\nThe problem?\nEven the ones who we think have it all are probably as much as unhappy as we are; \n for the simple reason that happiness seems to be a relational category.\nIn other words, if everybody around you is poor, then chances are you\u2019ll be much happier with what you have \u2013 even if that is nothing more than smithereens in comparison to what you have now.\nThat\u2019s why most of \n.\nDon\u2019t believe us?\nWell, here\u2019s a story for you.\nImagine a businessman taking a woman named Abby, a good friend of his, out to lunch. He\u2019s \u201cwildly successful\u201d: he has practically everything you\u2019ll never even dream of having.\nSo much, in fact, that he\u2019s not only taking Abby out in a limousine, but he\u2019s also blessed with the privilege of being able to point out to her (in the backseat of that lavish car) his name on the Forbes 400 list.\nCongratulations are in order, right?\nWell, of course.\nBut, just a few moments later, the guy \u201c[explodes] in indignation when he [notices] one of his competitors listed twenty places ahead of him.\u201d\t\n\u201cHow could that jerk possibly beat me!\u201d \u2013 he exclaims.\nNow, Abby is a friend of Janice Kaplan, the author of \nAnd the story above is only one of the many Janice shares with her readers to explain what\u2019s the problem with humans.\nPut in the simplest terms, we tend to sabotage ourselves; and it\u2019s time we stopped.\n\u201cNever compare,\u201d writes Kaplan, \u201cjust appreciate what you have.\u201d\nWhat Natural Selection Has to Say on the Matter\nis a doubly personal book: not only it contains a plethora of personal stories, and it chronicles a year in the life of the author (more on that below), but it also includes the findings of many studies which Kaplan uses to scientifically back her plea for gratitude.\nIn one of them, none other than \n explains why we ruminate on the wrong things and tend to neglect the right ones.\nIn fact, it is precisely because of this capability that our ancestors managed to survive and leave after them descendants that eventually gave birth to your mother and father.\nCan\u2019t make the connection?\nLet us make it for you!\nImagine yourself living in the Stone Age, bereft not only of Google but also of absolutely anything that may help you get by.\nNow, imagine coming across a bushy tree overflowing with shiny brightly-colored berries.\nWould you have one straight away, or would you resist the temptation?\nChances are you\u2019ll probably stay away \u2013 just like you would even today if you don\u2019t have your phone or your books with you and you happen upon a few tasty-looking mushrooms.\nWhy?\nBecause they might be poisonous.\nBut how would anyone learn if something is poisonous or not if nobody tried it?\nWell, he/she wouldn\u2019t; but if only one does try it and he falls sick/dies or is well enough to tell the story, then everyone may find out the truth.\nObviously enough, remembering the \n poisonous berry (and telling your friends about it) is much more important than describing the ten tasty ones.\nFast forward hundreds of thousands of years and you can see the problem.\nNamely, we still remember and talk about the poisonous berries much more than the tasty ones.\nThe Case for \nAnd that\u2019s how 2015 started for the American novelist, TV producer and magazine editor, Janice Kaplan.\nAuthor or coauthor of a dozen books (two of which \n \n bestsellers), Kaplan was also editor-in-chief of the \nmagazine when a rather dismal New Year\u2019s Eve completely changed her outlook on life.\nAfter hearing a woman talking about the poisonous berries in her life, Janice decided that she\u2019s had it enough; not with that woman, but with her own grousing and grumbling and griping.\nSo, she decided for one of the simplest and (as she discovered herself) most powerful New Year\u2019s resolutions one could make.\nRealizing that despite her loving family and her dynamic career, she wasn\u2019t that much different from that woman at the New Year Eve\u2019s party, Kaplan resolved to \u201cspend the coming year seeing the sunshine instead of the clouds.\u201d\nIn other words, she decided to become her own social scientist, choosing one area of her life to focus on every single month of the year; she started with her husband and her family (she focused on them during the winter), and then she moved on to her material belongings and her career (she focused on them during the spring.\nFor the summer months of 2015, Kaplan was grateful for her health and (we\u2019re going a bit meta here) her gratitude; finally, during the autumn months, she dealt with the three C\u2019s: coping, caring and connecting.\nThroughout the year, she kept a gratitude journal in which she wrote every night at least one thing she felt most grateful about during that day.\nThe Results of the Experiment\nLet\u2019s face it: you don\u2019t need this book to know that feeling grateful is a lot better than feeling grumpy; not because \n or because \n, but because, deep down inside you, you\u2019ve felt it on more than one occasion yourself.\nUpon relating her resolution to her husband Ron, Janice heard from him what she had always feared: \u201cYou probably don\u2019t appreciate what you have as much as you should,\u201d he said to her. \u201cYou pay too much attention to what\u2019s wrong rather than what\u2019s right.\u201d\nSo, she started turning things around; and the relationship with her husband seemed like the best place to start.\n\u201cWhen you expect everything,\u201d notes Kaplan aptly, \u201cit\u2019s hard to be grateful for anything. So. I decided that now was the time to put aside impossible expectations and start appreciating [my] husband.\u201d\nAfter a few passing remarks expressing her appreciation of him, she realized that things are changing between them; to her amazement, the warm feelings between them became \u201cstronger than ever.\u201d Gratitude, she concludes, \u201cwas making [them] both a lot happier.\u201d \nSo, naturally, Kaplan moved on from here to the relationships with her adult children and her career. When she felt ready, she instituted a \u201cno-complaining zone.\u201d \nAnd she stuck to it.\nUntil one day she was ready to even reconcile with her sister, with whom she eventually succeeded in beginning a \u201cnew friendship,\u201d based on \u201cappreciating the good in the moment rather than fussing about the past.\u201d\nYup, we \n think that there\u2019s something in this book that can remind one of \n.\nEpilogue, or a Few Words on Stoicism\nAs we said above, \nis a doubly personal book, since it includes both personal stories and personal research.\nAnd though, in essence, it can be summed up in a single imperative sentence \u2013 \u201cbe grateful for the good things you have in your life!\u201d \u2013 the book is filled with so many thought-provoking ideas about how one should live his/her life that we had no choice but to offer you this alternative summary (that doesn\u2019t mimic the structure of the book).\nOne thing that really struck us, however, was the fact that Kaplan\u2019s gratitude experiment bears so many similarities to \n.\n\u201cIf you can change something that\u2019s making you unhappy,\u201d writes Kaplan channeling Epictetus through her, \u201cgo ahead and change it. But if it\u2019s done, gone, or inevitable, what greater gift can you give yourself than gratitude for whatever life did bring?\u201d\nEpictetus \u2013 Kaplan\u2019s guide through many parts of this gratitude year by her own admission \u2013 taught that \u201cwe can be most content if we focus on what is in our power.\u201d\nWe can\u2019t stop the rain to go on a picnic \u2013 no matter how much we try; so, then why feeling bad because of it.\n\u201cI had started the year making myself\u2026 unhappy by looking at what I lacked,\u201d writes Kaplan in the conclusion of \n\u201cAfter this year, I understood that coming from a position of gratitude, you could still want (and get) more for yourself, your family, your career or the world. But you enjoyed more along the way.\u201d \nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Gratitude Diaries\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Happiness Is a Relational Category\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You Are Programmed to Be Grumpy\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gratitude Is Attitude\u2026 and It Can Change Your Life\nHappiness Is a Relational Category\nAccording to many studies, the main reason why you\u2019re unhappy is a fairly simple one: you focus on the things you lack instead of focusing on the things you own.\nThe risk?\nEven if you are Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos, you\u2019ll feel poor if when you fall to the fifth place of the Forbes 400 list \u2013 because there will be four guys in front of you.\nContrary to what so many books argue, happiness is not something you can acquire; \n.\nYou Are Programmed to Be Grumpy\nMake no mistake: you\u2019re comparing yourself to others because, evolutionary, that\u2019s exactly what has helped you get to where you are.\nComplaining about what doesn\u2019t work in your life is also beneficial in terms of natural selection: remembering the poisonous berry is much more important than remembering the tasty ones; it\u2019s also much important to share the first story with the others.\nIn fact, as Gregory Clark argues in \n, \u201cthose who were successful in the economy of the Malthusian era could well have been driven by a need to have more than their peers in order to be happy. Modern man might not be designed for contentment. The envious have inherited the earth.\u201d\nGratitude Is Attitude\u2026 and It Can Change Your Life\nJanice Kaplan thinks otherwise: it\u2019s time we left envy behind us and allow gratitude within us.\nchronicles her experiment \u2013 inspired by a survey funded by the John Templeton Foundation on the idea of gratitude \u2013 to keep a gratitude diary every single day of her life and start being appreciative of the things she has instead of envious of those she doesn\u2019t have.\n\u201cWe get used to something,\u201d she writes at one place, \u201cand then forget why it seemed so special in the first place.\u201d\nBeing grateful means remembering those parts of the story.\nThe final results are more than pleasing: gratitude makes life not only much more enjoyable but also worthwhile.\nKaplan writes:\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Gratitude Diaries Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nMany subtitles are an exaggeration; even though most of them sound precisely like the subtitle of Janice Kaplan\u2019s \n, it\u2019s difficult to say that she overstates anything when she claims that \u201ca year looking on the bright side can change your life.\u201d\nWe honestly believe that it can.\nIf proving us wrong means that you\u2019ll agree to live gratefully for a year \u2013 then that\u2019s a risk we\u2019re willing to take.\nDo that."},

Prum would like a chance to change your mind with a new theory, one aptly titled:\n.\nWho Should Read \u201cThe Evolution of Beauty\u201d? And Why?\nThe obvious answer is biologists, social biologists, and ornithologists.\nHowever, we think that this is a book that should interest everyone who likes to reread Darwin with fresher eyes.\nOr Dawkins.\nAbout Richard O. Prum\n is an American \u201cevolutionary ornithologist with broad interests in diverse topics,\u201d the William Robertson Coe Professor of Ornithology at Yale University.\nAfter receiving a BA at Harvard in 1983, Prum went on to obtain a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan six years later.\nHis field of specialty is the evolution of feathers, and his main interests include phylogenetics and sexual selection.\n is his only book so far.\n\u201cThe Evolution of Beauty PDF Summary\u201d\nDarwin\u2019s Biggest Problem\nDarwin\u2019s theory of evolution is, quite possibly, \n.\nIn fact, when back in 2012, Edge.org, the world\u2019s smartest website, \n the world of science \u201cwhat is your favorite deep, elegant, or beautiful explanation?\u201d most of the intellectuals surveyed answered something along the lines: \u201cof course it\u2019s Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, but I suppose everyone will say that, so I\u2019m going with\u2026\u201d\nConsequently, Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution is a theory which needs no introduction, and which, by Darwin\u2019s own admission from \n, can be summed up in a single phrase of Herbert Spencer: \u201cthe survival of the fittest.\u201d\nMost of the biologists living today would certainly agree with it; after all, why shouldn\u2019t they: it\u2019s a nice, neat theory which seems to explain the complexity of the world in such an economical manner that it\u2019s difficult to find any flaws with it.\nAnd yet, Darwin himself found a big, almost gaping hole in it: if the biological point of life is to be fit enough so that you can leave some offspring, then why should so many animals be so brightly colored and feature traits which instead of helping them survive, make them more vulnerable?\n\u201cThe sight of a feather in a peacock\u2019s tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!\u201d \u2013 grappling with this problem, \n.\nWhy should such a beautiful thing as a peacock\u2019s tail make anyone sick?\n\u201cBecause,\u201d writes Richard Prum, \u201cthe extravagance of its design seemed of no survival value whatsoever; unlike other heritable features that are the result of natural selection, the peacock\u2019s tail seemed to challenge everything that [Darwin] had said in \n.\u201d\nDarwin\u2019s Beautiful Solution\nSo, twelve years later, in his second-most famous book, \n, Darwin tried to solve this problem, the problem of impracticable beauty.\n\u201cIn this book,\u201d writes Richard Prum, Darwin \u201cproposed a second, independent mechanism of evolution \u2013 sexual selection \u2013 to account for armaments and ornaments, battle and beauty. If the results of natural selection were determined by the differential survival of heritable variations, then the results of sexual selection were determined by their differential sexual success \u2013 that is, by those heritable features that contribute to success at obtaining mates.\u201d\nPut plainly, sometimes it\u2019s not the fittest, but it\u2019s the most beautiful that survive.\nThis would explain not only the peacock\u2019s lavish tail, but also the elaborate feathers, exquisite songs, and mating dances of numerous other birds; it should also explain the white backside and legs of the Malaysian Banteng bull; it explains the red buttocks of many monkeys and apes as well.\nDarwin proposed that within this second dynamic force of evolution \u2013 sexual selection \u2013 two distinct and sometimes opposing mechanisms are at work:\n\u2022 \n, or \u201cthe struggle between individuals of one sex \u2013 often male \u2013 for sexual control over the individuals of the other sex;\u201d according to Darwin, the battle for sexual control was the main reason why some weapons of aggression (such as horns, antlers, and spurs) and large bodies appeared and evolved.\n\u2022 \n \n, or \u201cthe process by which the members of one sex \u2013 often female \u2013 choose their mates on the basis of their own innate preferences;\u201d it\u2019s Nature giving its species a second chance: you better be beautiful if you have no brains or brawn.\nThe law of the battle explains the evolution of armament; the taste for the beautiful \u2013 the evolution of ornament.\nThe Rejection of Darwin\u2019s Theory\nUnless you\u2019re an expert in Darwin, the section above should probably come as a surprise to you (we sure found it quite surprising).\nIts full implications: natural selection is \n the only driving force behind evolution; as impractical as it has become in the eyes of many precisely because of Darwin\u2019s theory, beauty may be an even more important factor in speciation and survival.\nHow did it happen that we forget this?\nWell, blame it on two Victorians and a bunch of Neo-Darwinists, writes Prum.\nThe first one among these is St. George Mivart, an English biologist and an ardent believer in natural selection for the fifteen or so years following the publication of the \n.\nMivart had problems specifically with the taste-for-the-beautiful mechanism mostly because, unlike natural selection, this one presupposed \u201cchoice, exercised freely.\u201d\nAlso, because he lived at a day and age when it was fashionable to be misogynist: \u201csuch is the instability of vicious feminine caprice\n\u201d Mivart wrote in a review of \n \u201cthat no constancy of coloration could be produced by its selective actions.\u201d\nThe other one to challenge Darwin\u2019s belief in the second evolutionary force \u2013 \u201csexual selection\u201d and \u201cmate choice\u201d \u2013 was none other than Alfred Russel Wallace, a man largely forgotten by history though he devised the theory of evolution concurrently with Darwin.\n\u201cThe only way in which we can account for the observed facts,\u201d wrote Wallace in his 1878 book, \n, \u201cis by supposing that color and ornament are strictly correlated with health, vigor, and general fitness to survive.\u201d\nAnd this view prevailed.\nMost of the Neo-Darwinists today believe that the flashiness of a peacock\u2019s tail speaks volumes of its fitness: \n\u201d\nThere\u2019s more to it, says Prum.\nRichard O. Prum to the Rescue\nAn \u201cobsessive birder,\u201d Richard O. Prum has studied the world of birds for over four decades, and so far has personally seen (and, in many cases, thoroughly examined) about a third of the world\u2019s ten thousand known bird species.\nHis view?\nAs far as birds are concerned, \u201caesthetic evolution has great explanatory power\u201d \u2013 in fact, much greater than the power of the \u201cfitness first\u201d model; rereading Darwin once again, he suggests, and accepting his more complicated evolutionary theory \u201crescues us from the tedious and limiting adaptationist insistence on the ubiquitous power of natural selection.\u201d\nPrum writes:\nIn other words, humans don\u2019t find symmetrical faces beautiful because they suggest great fitness; they find them beautiful because beauty is an important factor in evolution as well.\nNow, how did that happen?\nBecause (since we don\u2019t know the point of it all) it is inevitable that, at one point, natural selection should make way for sexual selection.\nWallace and Mivart thought that most of the species \u2013 in fact, all, excepting humans \u2013 are simply not that smart to make aesthetic choices.\nThe point is: they needn\u2019t be; either way, aesthetic evolution will happen.\nLet\u2019s explain this a little bit more.\nRemembering the Genius of Ronald Fisher\nFirst of all, as Prum himself indicates, this is far from a new idea.\nIn fact, the mathematical biologist Ronald Fisher, \u201cthe greatest of Darwin\u2019s successors,\u201d proposed quite a few theories that explain the lavishness of the peacock\u2019s tale, as well as sexual attractiveness as an evolutionary factor a century ago.\nThe most interesting among these are certainly \n and \n. \nAccording to \n(a theory which wins our vote for the best-named scientific theory in history), a female\u2019s ideal choice for a male partner is one whose genes should produce a male offspring with the best chances for reproductive success.\nThe result \u2013 \n \u2013 \u201cis that one of the most desirable qualities a male can have in the eyes of a female is, quite simply, sexual attractiveness itself.\u201d\nSounds a bit tautological, but it makes sense:\nBrad Pitt is not healthier than most males; he\u2019s just more beautiful than them and a guarantor that his children will also be beautiful enough to have children themselves.\nAnd this makes even more sense if you add the second of Fisher\u2019s many theories: the Fisherian runaway, basically the foundational block of Prum\u2019s book.\nAccording to Fisher, both Wallace and Darwin were right, but in relation to different phases of evolution.\nNamely, originally females preferred male traits which were \u201chonest and accurate indices of health, vigor, and survival ability.\u201d\nIn other words, the first generation of peacock\u2019s with more ornamental tails was necessarily healthier and more fit for survival than those whose tails were ordinary; consequently, these were the ones who survived.\nBut this is where it gets interesting: with them, the genes contributing to ornamentation survived as well.\nReady for another tautology?\nNow precisely because of the fact that these birds were the chosen ones, their genes evolved to make their tails even more ornamental so that their male offspring be the chosen ones as well!\nIn other words, \u201cthe very existence of mate choice would \n the display trait from its original honest, quality information by creating a new, unpredictable, aesthetically driven evolutionary force: sexual attraction to the trait itself\u201d:\n\u201cOnce the trait is attractive,\u201d writes Prum, \u201cits attractiveness and popularity become ends in themselves\u2026 Desire for beauty will endure and undermine the desire for truth.\u201d\nManakin Dances and Bowerbird Nests\nNow, Prum spends most of his book demonstrating the effects of this theory in practice; and he does this so beautifully that we think summarizing or even paraphrasing his descriptions of bird-mating rituals is both a sin and beyond our capabilities.\nNevertheless, we do like to at least point out to you two interesting examples. \nAfter going over the sex life of the Great Argus (\u201ceminently interesting\u201d for Darwin) as well, Prum spends the third chapter of his book describing the carefully choreographed dances of the manakins.\nIn lieu of words, here\u2019s a Nat Geo video that will force you to reinterpret \n:\nWhat about bowerbird males?\nThey mastered bower building millennia before humans.\nWhy?\nBecause of sex, that\u2019s why. \nWe guess some of these birds realized that if you\u2019re not fit enough to be a boxer to beat the hell out of your competitors, you can become a poet or an architect and pray that you\u2019ll charm the socks off of ladies through skill only.\nSpeaking of \u2013\nThe Two Routes of Evolution and the Queering of Homo Sapiens\nUnlike most of the hardcore Neo-Darwinists, Prum thinks that evolution is not merely about the survival of the fittest.\nIn fact, that mechanism, in his opinion, is just one of the two routes of evolution, the one in which predominantly males make the choice for females; but, there\u2019s another more beautiful route, the one in which ladies are the ones who choose.\nDifferent species have taken different routes.\nFor example, in the world of gorillas and many duck species, males use threats and force to command exclusivity in their mating access to females; often they even murder the offspring of their predecessors; this is the route of force, survival of the fittest at its brawniest.\nThe aesthetic route works in a much different manner; in this case, one of the sexes respects the other sex\u2019s priorities and tries to appeal to them through certain behaviors and rituals.\nThe second route is the route of the modern humans; and it explains why some ostensibly counter-evolutionary behaviors and traits (homosexuality, monogamy, female orgasm, paternal care, the shrinkage of all body parts except the brains and the genitalia, permanent breasts, etc.) appeared.\nIn a way, most of this happened because we select each other \n via sexual attractiveness, respecting the choice of the other sex. \nAnd because, consequently, for humans, sex has become a ritual, not unlike the manakin dances or the bowerbird nests.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Evolution of Beauty\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You Don\u2019t Really Know Your Darwin\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Fisherian Runaway: How Natural Selection Becomes Sexual Selection\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beauty Happens \u2013 and Is All Around You\nYou Don\u2019t Really Know Your Darwin\nAccording to Prum, though his thesis may sound a bit controversial to modern Darwinists, Darwin would have undoubtedly approved of it.\nBecause, in addition to the natural selection theory (from the \n), he also devised a corollary sexual selection mechanism (in the \n) which aimed to explain the ornamental qualities which appear in many species \u2013 such as, for example, the highly impractical tail of the peacock:\nDarwin\u2019s Sexual Selection and the Fisherian Runaway\nDarwin\u2019s theory of mate choice includes two mechanisms \u2013 \n and \n \u2013 which should explain the origins and the evolution of both armament and ornament in all species.\nHowever, the latter one was all but scoffed at by everyone \u2013 because the female choice was too subjective to be a driving evolutionary force \u2013 until Ronald Fisher tried to explain it in an interesting manner.\nNamely, according to Fisher, the ornaments originally were practical signals for fitness; however, precisely because of this, in time, they evolved to become signals on their own, and future generations developed them because the individuals with these traits were the individuals with offspring.\nHere\u2019s an interesting analogy: \nGout was historically known as the \u201crich man\u2019s disease\u201d because it appears more often in those who regularly eat meat and drink beer. So, when a poor man happened to develop gout back in the 18\n century, he wore it proudly \u2013 it gave him a chance to have sex with a money-grabber.\nBeauty Happens \u2013 and Is All Around You\nPrum demonstrates \u2013 through many examples from the avian world \u2013 that evolution is not only about the fittest, but also about the most beautiful or about the ones who can produce most beauty.\nThat\u2019s why some birds dance and others build beautiful bowers; and that\u2019s why humans write poems or sculpt statues of their Muses.\nIt\u2019s their best shot at getting some.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Evolution of Beauty Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nGroundbreaking and alluring, \nwas a Pulitzer Prize finalist and one of the ten best books of 2017 according to \nWe believe that it\u2019s one of those books which will be debated for many years to come.\nSo, read it now \u2013 so that you can talk about it with your grandchildren."},

And Why?\nAs you can infer from the subtitle, \n is not one of your skim-on-the-beach or speed-read-in-your-bed just-to-pass-the-time-or-fall-asleep books. \nAfter all, Steven Pinker\u2019s objective in it is to challenge most of the modern views on what makes us human and to demonstrate that, due to modern politics and sociology, most of us are in denial when it comes to the basic building blocks of the human nature.\nIn a nutshell \u2013 as should be only obvious according to Pinker \u2013 these building blocks are the ones we\u2019d describe as such \n: \n. Pinker\u2019s argument is not only that our genes play a large part in making us who we are; it\u2019s that they play a \n larger part than upbringing.\nAnd in more than 500 pages, he offers so much evidence in favor of this idea that, whether you like him or not, he makes it impossible to ignore him.\nAnd if you are a student of psychology, philosophy, history or biology \u2013 you \n; if you are a teacher and an avid reader interested in what makes us our journey here worthwhile \u2013 you \n; finally, if you firmly believe, \n, that \u201cthe unexamined life is not worth living\u201d \u2013 you \n.\nAbout  Steven Pinker \n is a Canadian-American cognitive psychologist and linguist, one of the most renowned popularizers of science of the 20\n and 21\n century.\nHighly influenced by Noam Chomsky, Pinker has authored numerous books in which he argues that the human aptitude for language is, more or less, preprogrammed in our brains by evolution and natural selection.\nThe most well-known among these is, perhaps, \n, the first of Pinker\u2019s (so far) eight books aimed at the general public; published in 1994, the book was followed by \n, \n, \nand\n\u2013 four more books which explore similar language-related problems.\nThe other three popular science books by Pinker \u2013 \n, \n, and \n\u2013 are much broader in scope; both optimistic and controversial, they argue that humans are continually progressing toward a better future and that they owe this progress to their genetically predefined nature.\nWinner of many awards, Pinker has been listed as one of the most influential intellectuals of today by numerous publications.\nFind out more at \n. \n \u201cThe Blank Slate PDF Summary\u201d\nIn \n, Steven Pinker attempts to refute the theory that we are all born as a \n and to demonstrate to which extent human behavior is shaped by evolutionary and psychological adaptations.\nIn other words, as far as Pinker is concerned, nature beats nurture by a country mile.\nAnd he provides a lot of evidence to corroborate this claim.\nPart I: The Blank Slate, The Noble Savage, and the Ghost in The Machine\nIn the first part of \n, Steven Pinker introduces us to the three most influential theories about human nature ever developed; and then he examines their flaws.\nAs the title itself reveals, this explanation of human nature is the one Pinker is interested in the most. It is also one of the earliest ones, first posited by John Locke in \n back in 1690.\nAccording to Locke, there is no inherent human nature: the mind is nothing more but a blank slate at birth (\nin Latin) and, throughout life, experience fills it with relevant information and data.\nIn other words, if you were switched at birth and raised by a different set of parents, you would have developed into a completely different person.\nWhen it was discovered in 2001 that the human genome contains several times fewer genes than what neuroscientists and geneticists initially believed, the blank slate defenders were all but sure to have won a resounding victory.\nAt least as far as they are concerned, our complex minds are developed gradually, via two powerful mechanisms: connectionism (the neural networks grow connections \u2013 and that\u2019s how we learn) and \n (the brain changes its form over a lifetime). \nThe main problems?\nWell, if this is the case, then why do computers (aka AI) don\u2019t learn as well as we do? Why are even children capable of recognizing that both Garfield and your neighbor\u2019s Siamese are cats, and yet the most powerful computers need millions of images to make that connection?\nMoreover, why do twins grow to look so much like each other even when separated at birth?\nMore on this below.\nLittle more than half a century after John Locke developed the tabula rasa model of humans \u2013 namely, that we are products of our experiences \u2013 Jean-Jacques Rousseau came up with yet another theory, the idea of the Noble Savage.\nIn his \u201c\n,\u201d Rousseau argued that prehistoric humans would have completely obliterated each other if their minds were blank slates and they acted in \n.\nConsequently, the first humans must have been peaceful and uncompetitive, because, in addition to the fact that there weren\u2019t that many of them, they were also living in a world which provided everything in abundance.\nIt was civilization that made everything worse, promoting greed and violence as a way to deal with the scarcity of resources.\nFew modern authors \u2013 \n \u2013 still believe that Rousseau was right.\nHowever, a number of studies have shown that \n, aggression and violence included.\nThe third theory of human nature was first devised as a cogent theory by \n, even though it is as old as some of the earliest religious and philosophical thinkers.\nIn Descartes\u2019 opinion, we are composed of two different systems, one of which is our physical/material body, and the other one which is our mind.\nAnd as much as the former can be explained in terms of simple physics and mechanics, the latter is just too complicated to be translated into terms ordinary humans understand, because, well, it\u2019s beyond our rational comprehension.\nModern science backs some of these claims, referring to this latter part as \n. \nHowever, even this division fails to explain why separated twins often grow to prefer the same brand of cigarettes!\nPart II: Fear and Loathing\nIf a few simple experiments with twins are enough to put a question mark next to these three prevalent theories, then why are they still resiliently alive?\nSteven Pinker thinks he knows why.\nIt isn\u2019t because of science, he says; it is because of politics and religion, which \u2013 as you should be aware by now \u2013 are the two least scientific aspects of human existence.\nSimply put, the ideology of the political left would crumble to pieces if human nature \nbe explained in terms of the blank slate or the noble savage theory.\nContrarywise, the political right and many religious groups prefer \u201cthe ghost in the machine\u201d model of human nature, because, otherwise, their notions of the world would prove to be scientifically faulty.\nConsequently, as soon as modern researchers started pointing out that the natural human state is a bit more complicated than what Locke and Rousseau believed, radical Marxists attacked the ideas as \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d\nBecause if humans are \n different, and if violence is in their blood, then the idea of a utopian society where everyone is equal is, well, utopian; even more \u2013 fairytale-like, having nothing to do with reality.\nOn the other hand, if we think and feel due to nothing more than some chemical processes happening inside our brains, and if the mind isn\u2019t able to live without (aka \n) the body, then most of the religions of the world make no sense whatsoever.\nIn conclusion, it seems that we hold on to certain beliefs of what human nature is like due to our fears that if it is any different, the world should collapse.\nPart III: Human Nature with a Human Face\nIn the third part of \n, Steven Pinker examines further these fears; he deduces that they all boil down to four fundamental fears.\nThe Blank Slate theory, admits Steven Pinker, is \nappealing; after all, if every single difference is the result of nurture and upbringing, then we merely need to change the society and humans should change as well.\nThe Blank Slate, he says, serves as \u201ca guarantor of political equality;\u201d dismissing it, say its defenders, would unavoidably lead to three evils:\n\u2022 \n: \u201cif groups of people are biologically different, it could be rational to discriminate against the members of some of the groups.\u201d\n\u2022 \n: \u201cif differences among groups in their station in life\u2014their income, status, and crime rate, for example\u2014come from their innate constitutions, the differences cannot be blamed on discrimination, and that makes it easy to blame the victim and tolerate inequality;\u201d\n\u2022 \n: \u201cif people differ biologically in ways that other people value or dislike, it would invite them to try to improve society by intervening biologically\u2014by encouraging or discouraging people\u2019s decisions to have children, by taking that decision out of their hands, or by killing them outright.\u201d\nAccording to Steven Pinker, all of these are nonsequiturs, since \u201cequality is not the empirical claim that all groups of humans are interchangeable; it is the moral principle that individuals should not be judged or constrained by the average properties of their group.\u201d\nPinker says that all of our societies are based on a tradeoff between freedom and material equality; and \u201cthe major political philosophies can be defined by how they deal with the tradeoff\u201d:\nNow, if our genes influence our behavior to such a great extent, and if violence and immorality are \nin this sense \u2013 then how are we supposed to go on living?\n\u201cThe dread of a permanently wicked human nature takes two forms,\u201d clarifies Pinker.\nThe first form is rather practical: if human nature is unchangeable, then it\u2019s a waste of time to try and change some individuals.\nThe second is even deeper: if it comes naturally to someone to rape someone else, then, by which measures, have we decided that this individual is fit for jail?\nHold your horses, says Pinker: if something is natural, it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s good or that it must be tolerated.\nBecause just as natural as it comes to the rapist to rape someone, it comes to the raped one to defend himself/herself and to \nwant to be forced into having sexual intercourse.\nThat\u2019s why we have a society: to decide which of the things that come naturally to some people can be tolerated and which should not.\nThe second fear is related to the third one, possibly the shallowest one and the one least related to the blank slate.\nNamely, the fear of determinism, the \u201cgaping existential anxiety: that deep down we are not in control of our own choices.\u201d\nNow, if that\u2019s the case, then why shouldn\u2019t I use it to excuse my behaviors, no matter how immoral they are?\nThe answer is much the same as the one above: because we\u2019re talking about two different systems, muddled by the Romantic idea that what\u2019s natural is good.\nNot only this most certainly is not the case, but it should also influence not one bit our legal and penitentiary institutions. \nExplaining someone else\u2019s behavior doesn\u2019t excuse it.\nThink of it this way: even though, in \nRaskolnikov has a perfectly cogent, logical explanation as to why he has murdered two fellow human beings, he still ends up in Siberia.\nIt makes no difference whether the explanation is biological or a philosophical one.\n\u201cThe final fear of biological explanations of the mind,\u201d writes Pinker, \u201cis that they may strip our lives of meaning and purpose\u201d:\nTo go back to Dostoyevsky and a question he posited in another one of his classics (\n): is not, in a world without God, \n permitted?\nPinker thinks that this argument is blown out of proportions, due to at least two different reasons:\n\u2022 Everything is permitted in a world \nGod as well; only, in that case, it is to a selected number of people (the ones who interpret God\u2019s message \n than the rest); after all, both Hitler and the terrorists who crashed into the WTC believed they were carrying out a divine mission;\n\u2022 There is a difference between \u201c\n (why something evolved by natural selection)\u201d and \u201cproximate causation (how the entity works here and now).\u201d\n\u201cSometimes the most selfish thing a gene can do is wire \n motives into a human brain\u2014heartfelt, unstinting, deep-in-the-marrow unselfishness,\u201d explains Pinker. \nAnd he goes on: \u201cThe love of children (who carry one\u2019s genes into posterity), a faithful spouse (whose genetic fate is identical to one\u2019s own), and friends and allies (who trust you if you\u2019re trustworthy) can be bottomless and unimpeachable as far as we, humans, are concerned (proximate level), even if it is metaphorically self-serving as far as the genes are concerned (ultimate level).\u201d\nPart IV: Know Thyself\nEven centuries after the three visions of the human nature described in Part I above were first proposed, people still think of humans along these lines.\nFor classical economists, for example, humans are still those rational self-interested people who base all of their decision on whether they benefit them personally; utopian socialists, on the other hand, are even surer that humans are biologically nothing less than noble savages who\u2019d much rather live in peace than die by violence.\nScience has conclusively shown, however, that neither of these views is accurate: we are neither selfish egoists nor selfless altruists.\nWe are something in-between.\nWe prefer to live in harmony with others because, evolutionary, this has helped us survive; misanthropes never stood a chance in ancient societies, and tribes thrived.\nHowever, there are limits to our desire to live in a community, and you can discover those limits if you take a look at the history of the Israeli kibbutzim, collective communities envisioned as utopian a century ago.\nHowever, in time, this vision evolved since, for example, mothers wanted to sleep next to their children and didn\u2019t want them to be raised communally. \nWhen you think about it, as much as classical economists say that humans are by nature competitive, they almost never steal food from their children, loved ones or close relatives \u2013 even when very hungry.\nHowever, they might even kill someone they don\u2019t know in that situation. \nPart V: Hot Buttons\nIn the final part of his book, Steven Pinker tries to show how science can help us reach some common ground in relation to some of the most hotly debated topics in all times and all places:\n\u2022 \n. Unfortunately, it seems that a large part of our political beliefs is in our blood: twins, separated at birth, share 0.62 (out of 1) of their political beliefs; it is because of the rest 0.38 that there are changes; education may help;\n\u2022 \n. Once again, violence is hereditary, and it is an inseparable trait of the human nature; prehistoric societies were violent, and no matter how much we progress, future societies will be violent as well; interestingly enough, economic equality seems to stifle violence;\n\u2022 \n. Male and female brains aren\u2019t interchangeable: they are different; while women are better at spelling, reading body language and matching shapes, men have a stronger capacity to manipulate 3D objects mentally; but science has found no reason whatsoever to believe that one gender is more superior than the other;\n\u2022 \n. According to Eric Turkheimer, three things influence how children turn out to grow up in the end: their genes, their family environment, their unique environment (friends and neighborhood); we don\u2019t know the ratio, but these are the estimates: genes: 40%, family: 10%, unique environment: 50%.\n\u2022 \n. Art is in our nature \u2013 in the blood and in the bone, in our brains and in our genes. However, we seem to be evolutionarily programmed to prefer traditional art and beauty to their modern counterparts; art, in other words, is not in decline; conventional art \n\u2013 and this has to be remedied as soon as possible.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Blank Slate\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There Are Three Theories of the Human Nature \u2013 and All Are Flawed\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Blank Slate Is a Political Vision of the Human Nature\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Facing the Facts Doesn\u2019t Mean Tolerating Them\nThere Are Three Theories of the Human Nature \u2013 and All Are Flawed\nThroughout history, there have been three attempts to describe the human nature:\n\u2022 \n: experience makes us who we are: at birth, we are all equal;\n\u2022 \n: human nature was originally benevolent and cooperative \u2013 civilization ruined us;\n\u2022 \n: our body can be explained in matters of mechanics; the same isn\u2019t true in relation to our brain.\nAccording to Steven Pinker \u2013 and science \u2013 none of these three theories makes sense.\nThe Blank Slate Is a Political Vision of the Human Nature\nThe most resilient of these three theories seem to be the Lockean: the blank slate. However, the main reason why we still believe it is an accurate depiction of human nature is political.\nPut simply, believing that we are biologically one way or another is, on the surface, much more dangerous than believing that society makes us who we are; if the latter is true, then we can still talk about equality and sexual freedom; however, the former seems too restricting.\nFacing the Facts Doesn\u2019t Mean Tolerating Them\nHowever, Pinker shows that all of those fears of biologically determined human nature \u2013 the fears of inequality, of imperfectability, of determinism, and of nihilism \u2013 are nonsequiturs.\nThe fact that we\u2019ve got to here is evidence enough.\nWe don\u2019t need to be \nto be \n, nor do we need to be inherently altruistic to start caring about some other people in a more rational manner; finally, if our biological constitution is purposeless in terms of grand meaning \u2013 then why shouldn\u2019t we just invent one?\nWe\u2019re good at doing that.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Blank Slate Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nNominated for the 2003 Aventis Prize and a finalist for that year\u2019s Pulitzer Prize, \nhas been one of the most talked-about books of the past two decades, at least as good as \nand \n(to paraphrase a review by \n).\nDubbed by some \u201cthe most important book\u2026 published in the 21\n century\u201d (psychologist David Buss) and criticized by others as a mere bashing of \u201cthe Lockean-Rousseauian-Cartesian scarecrow that Pinker has created,\u201d \nis, to quote a review by \n, \u2018an extremely good book \u2013 clear, well argued, fair, learned, tough, witty, humane, stimulating.\u201d\nLike it or hate it, chances are you\u2019ll be a much richer and smarter human being once you read it.\nSo, please do."},

Wilson is widely considered one of the leading social psychologists of today.\nIn fact, his 1977 article \u201cTelling more than we can know \u2013 verbal reports on mental processes\u201d (co-authored with Richard Nisbett) is one of the most cited psychology articles in history, and his introductory primer \n(co-authored with \n and Robin Akert) is used as a textbook at many universities around the world.\nIn addition, Wilson is the winner of several awards, such as the All-University Outstanding Teaching Award (2001) and the University of Virginia Distinguished Scientist Award (2010); since 2009, he is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nFind out more at \n \n\u201cStrangers to Ourselves PDF Summary\u201d\nChapter 1: Freud\u2019s Genius, Freud\u2019s Myopia\nTwo thousand years ago, in the pronaos of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi \u2013 at least according to ancient writers \u2013 still stood inscribed one of the most famous maxims in the history of philosophy: \u201cKnow thyself!\u201d\nAnd up until the end of the 19\n century, many people believed that, buried beneath those two words, there lay an eternal truth, an almost divine imperative: not knowing yourself was a sin; knowing yourself was the only right way to go about in life.\nAnd then came \n and uncovered a frightening secret, one which nobody was prepared to hear out loud: it is difficult to know yourself, and that\u2019s because most of your mind operates \n.\n: not only is not all thinking conscious thinking, but \n \neludes us.\nInterestingly enough, as Wilson shows, this is not something uncovered by Freud; philosophers and thinkers such as Leibnitz and Pascal, Shelling and William Hamilton had devised theories of the unconscious long before the Austrian.\nThey all shared the belief that some of our thinking is automatic and that some of our prejudices are beyond our rationality; even more, that we may be wrong about many of our own feelings and that some things, well, we just do (despite what we think about them).\nWhat these authors intuited and Freud failed to see is that the unconscious is, almost by definition, ungraspable through introspection.\nAnd that\u2019s one of the scariest sentences you\u2019ll ever read.\nChapter 2: The Adaptive Unconscious\n\u201cConsider that at any given moment,\u201d writes Timothy Wilson in the second chapter of \n, \u201cour five senses are taking in more than 11,000,000 pieces of information.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a lot!\nSo much, in fact, that scientists have long wondered about the capability of our conscious mind to process that many signals at any given moment.\nThe short answer: no, it cannot. \nThe long answer: not only it cannot, but it is also incredibly bad at it. In fact, \u201cthe most liberal estimate is that people can process consciously about 40 pieces of information per second.\u201d\nWhere does the rest of it go?\nYou\u2019ve guessed it alright!\nDown the drain, hidden from sight, in the adaptive unconscious, from where it constantly lurks and influences us.\nWhich is why Wilson neatly defines the adaptive unconscious thus:\nBut how does the unconscious influence your feelings, judgments, and behavior? \nWell, we have some vague sense about it.\nYou\u2019ll make no mistake to think of it as a sort of a guardian angel, filtering out information it deems unnecessary or harmful so that it can protect your psychological wellbeing \u2013 in much the same manner that your physical wellbeing is protected by your \n.\n\u201cWhen it comes to maintaining a sense of well-being,\u201d writes Wilson, \u201ceach of us is the ultimate spin doctor.\u201d\nOK, that\u2019s a strange kind of a guardian angel \u2013 one that spits in the face of everything you know about yourself.\nOr at least you think you do.\nChapter 3: Who\u2019s in Charge?\nTo answer the question from the title of this chapter, you have to first understand that your unconscious mind is much older than your conscious mind; and that the role of the latter is, in many cases, to create an illusion of control.\nIn other words, both your unconscious and conscious mind work simultaneously inside your head; however, most of the time, you feel as if your conscious mind has everything under control.\n\u201cA more accurate view of the role of consciousness,\u201d writes Wilson, \u201cmay be consciousness-as\u2013Ronald Reagan.\u201d \nPut simply: your consciousness is (both to you and itself) your presidential self, the Great Communicator, the executive power; but, in fact, it is no more than \u201ca spokesperson for a cadre of smart and hardworking powers (actually layers of powers), some known to outsiders, and some unknown.\u201d\nSo, the truth is \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to say who\u2019s in charge and when; but it\u2019s somewhat easier to note the differences between the two thinking authorities working inside you.\nYou want to hear the most interesting and frightening part of Wilson\u2019s analysis?\nWe have absolutely no system inside us to decide which task would be better processed by which system; the only system at work seems to be \n.\nHence all of your prejudices, \n, beliefs not supported by stats, etc. etc.\nChapter 4: Knowing Who We Are\nThe reason why it is difficult to discover who you are is very simple: you are not one person.\nThere are at least two personalities inside you, one accessible and constructed by your conscious self, and another all but unreachable and created by your adaptive unconscious.\nUp until the 1970s, almost all research was focused on the first type of personality; after all, it was the only one of whose existence we could be sure of.\nAnd then, in 1968, a guy named Walter Mischel discovered that none of the approaches popular at the time \u201cmet the gold standard of personality research very well, namely [Gordon] Allport\u2019s criterion of predicting with any certainty what people actually do\u201d:\nWhat Mischel actually discovered was that our \u201ccharacteristic behavior and thought\u201d (Allport\u2019s definition of a theory of personality) actually a mixed genre.\nNamely, in addition to being non-fictional (what our conscious mind objectively thinks is our characteristic behavior) it is also at least as much a fiction, created by our conscious mind to describe the actions of our adaptive unconscious.\nMischel described at least 5 (if-then) rules which guide behavior:\n\u2022 encodings (people\u2019s constructs of themselves and others);\n\u2022 expectancies about themselves and the world;\n\u2022 affectations and emotions;\n\u2022 goals and values;\n\u2022 competencies and self-regulatory plans.\nChapter 5: Knowing Why\nWhether you like it or not, as we already told you while summarizing David McRaney\u2019s \n, \u201cyou are often ignorant of your motivations and create fictional narratives to explain your decisions, emotions, and history without realizing it.\u201d\nIt\u2019s called confabulation and is what you may be doing all the time to stay alive and healthy.\nTo test out the implications of this, Timothy Wilson and his collaborator Richard Nisbett showed four identical pairs of pantyhose to numerous people.\nTheir job was to choose their favorite one.\nThe strange thing is that all of them \n chose one; the even stranger one is that almost all of them had an explanation for their choice.\nUnfortunately, these explanations may be nothing more but a way of your conscious mind to explain the decisions of the unconscious mind, and, thus provide your sometimes-inexplicable actions with a \u201cwhy.\u201d\nOur explanations of our own behavior are often no more accurate than the explanations a total stranger may have and are based on four general types of information:\n\u2022 \n (such as \u201cpeople are in bad moods on Mondays\u201d or \u201copposites attract each other\u201d);\n\u2022 \n(first we observe our own responses and then infer what is causing them: I like these two movies, and DeNiro is starring in each of them \u2013 I like DeNiro);\n\u2022 \n (\u201cPeople have idiosyncratic theories about the causes of their responses that are not shared by the culture at large, such as the theory that going to large parties often makes them depressed.\u201d\n\u2022 \nChapter 6: Knowing How We Feel\nAccording to many philosophers \u2013 Descartes and Wittgenstein among them \u2013 \u201creports about sensations and feelings are incorrigible.\u201d\nIn other words, if you feel that your head hurts and you claim that it does, then it most certainly \n, regardless of whether doctors can find something wrong with it.\nAnd there are at least two reasons why almost everybody believes to be so: the measurement and the theory problem.\nAccording to the measurement problem, \u201ceven if people can be wrong about their feelings in principle, we have no way of knowing if and when this is the case because we do not have a pipeline to people\u2019s feelings that is independent of their self-reports.\u201d\nThe theory problem, on the other hand, is \u201cthe question of how and why the mind would be organized in such a way that people can be wrong about their feelings. Why on earth would humans be built this way?\u201d\nHowever, Wilson shows why both the measurement and the theory problem are not enough to dismiss the idea that reports about sensations are incorrigible.\nIn the case of the measurement problem, there is often evidence that self-reports are false and can be discounted: husbands often say that they are tired when they are, in fact, jealous; and their wives can guess this.\nIn the case of the theory problem, it\u2019s even simpler: the functional approach can\u2019t explain many other things (such as dreams, contagious yawning, lefties), so why should it be able to explain all reports of feelings?\nIn addition, there are people who suffer from alexithymia, a condition in which they are unable to explain the things they authentically feel.\nChapter 7: Knowing How We Will Feel\nThink winning the lottery will make you happy?\nThink again!\nStudies show that most lottery winners are actually miserable after winning the lottery.\nThe reason?\nTheir only goal was to win it, and, unfortunately, they overestimated the duration of happiness this will bring them.\nIn truth, we all this: we think that finding the perfect partner will make us happy forever or that the death of a closed one will cripple us for eternity.\nThe truth is, we\u2019ll overcome the latter, and the former will make us happy only for a certain amount of time.\nWe are resilient because we have a sort of an allostasis mechanism which prevents us from experiencing extremes, regardless of whether they are positive or negative.\nSimply put, we tend to \neverything, so that we can survive: unless we rob some events of their emotional power, we may be unable to function properly in their absence (if positive) or constant presence (if negative).\nThink of what happens to your ears when you go to a crowded place in which there\u2019s loud music; at first, you can\u2019t really understand what\u2019s happening, but then you can even discern voices. Your ears equalize the noise; well, so does your mind when it comes to feelings.\nYou can encourage it to do this by setting yourself a goal toward which you need to work; \n, as long as you have a goal, you can recover from everything.\nChapter 8: Introspection and Self-Narratives\n\u201cIntrospection,\u201d writes Wilson, \u201cis a very broad term, covering many different ways of examining the contents of one\u2019s own mind.\u201d\nEither way, whether it\u2019s \u201cbrief, off-the-cuff attempts to figure out how we feel about something\u201d or \u201cdecades-long self-analyses recorded in lengthy journals,\u201d introspection is incapable of helping us find out how our unconscious is working.\nBecause it is hidden by a self-narrative, the biography of ourselves written by us, whose goal is not to make us known to us better, but to help us find our way around.\nThe most important thing to note here is that more accurate self-narrative doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a more functional person.\nIn fact, it is often the other way around.\nFor example, according to a well-known study, students who analyze why they have chosen a poster for their room feel much less happy about it two weeks later than students who don\u2019t.\nEven stranger, relationships tend to last longer with people who scrutinize them less often and less profound; and the ones who do may be wrong; it doesn\u2019t matter.\nDoes this mean that we shouldn\u2019t be collecting information?\nNo.\nIt only means that we should collect just enough data so that we can inform our unconscious to make a gut decision, and then let our conscious mind to stabilize it in a narrative we\u2019ll firmly believe in.\nToo many questions \u2013 and you\u2019ll threaten the stability of the narrative. \nAnd that\u2019s rarely a good idea.\nChapter 9: Looking Outward to Know Ourselves\nConsider this: instinctually, you have nothing more than a vague idea of how your pulmonary system works and, yet, you breathe.\nThe only way to find out what happens inside you when you do is if you consult outside information.\nWhy should it be any different with your psychological system?\nInterestingly enough \u2013 and contrary to just about every self-help book ever written \u2013 this means that you should listen to what others are saying about you much more than you do; because they actually know more about you than yourself.\nWhy?\nSimply put, they see you how you act and do not have access to the narratives you use to explain your actions; so, they devise their own.\nStudies show that these are necessarily more objective than your survival-driven self-narratives.\nOf course, people tend to lie, and we sometimes project our theories and analyze their words through them.\nEither way, when it comes to your behavior and your personality, the lesson is this: believe others at least as much as you believe yourself, if not more.\nChapter 10: Observing and Changing our Behavior\nThere\u2019s also another thing you can do in addition to observing others observing you; namely \u2013 analyzing your actions.\nIn other words, try to dissever your actions from the things you think are your motivations and then try to find patterns among them.\nYou\u2019ll be surprised to find out that, at least some of the time, your motivations are actually hidden from you.\nAnd that you\u2019ve hidden them from yourself.\nCan you hack the system?\nApparently, you can.\nAnd it\u2019s as simple as that AA motto: \n.\nNamely, act like the person you want to become, and that may trick your unconscious into believing that this is the person you are.\nOr, in the words of Wilson:\nKey Lessons from \u201cStrangers to Ourselves\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You Don\u2019t Know Much About Yourself: You Is Someone Else\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Want to Know Yourself Better?

Ask Your Friends What They Think of You!\nThe reason why you see yourself differently than how others see you is simple: you invent self-narratives which help you function better which often don\u2019t correlate with the objective truth (if that\u2019s at all attainable).\nIn other words, other people know you better than you know yourself because they don\u2019t have mechanisms inside them to justify your behavior.\nThat\u2019s why peer reports tend to predict better the behavior of people than self-reports: as much as the latter are related to the conscious part of our own beings, the former delve into the adaptive unconscious, virtually unknown to us.\nFool Your Unconscious: Act as the Person You Want to Be\nMany therapies for both alcoholics and chronically depressive people include a well-known and sometimes unjustly ridiculed credo: fake it until you make it.\nThere\u2019s a reason for this.\nDeliberately changing your behavior (your conscious mind telling your body to do something your body is refusing to do), in time, will certainly affect your self-conception and may even alter your unconscious being.\n\u201cLittle steps can lead to big changes\u2026 and all of us have the ability to act more like the person we want to be.\u201d\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cStrangers to Ourselves Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\n\u201cIn \n,\u201d \n about a decade ago, \u201cI probably owe a bigger intellectual debt to Tim Wilson (and his longtime collaborator, Jonathan Schooler) than anyone else, and \n is probably the most influential book I\u2019ve ever read.\u201d\nDescribing his own work as \u201ca kind of popularized version of Wilson\u2019s own work,\u201d Gladwell goes on to note that in the \u201cbeautifully written\u201d \nWilson is such a crucial book because it \u201casks the question: what, at the end of the day, can we really know about ourselves?\u201d\nThe answer: \u201cnot much.

And Why?\nSometimes, you\u2019ll be chastised by your colleagues, friends or even family, and you don\u2019t have to pretend that you are fine.\nOn the second thought, some people reckon that beliefs form the inner reality, even when these notions are nothing but self-created.\nAnyway, \u201c\n\u201d unravels the cause of downheartedness and helps you to pick up the pace in generating a response. As such, we find it highly insightful and immensely practical for the general audience.\nGiving it a quick read is the least you can do. \nAbout Mel Robbins\n obtained a law degree from Boston College Law School in 1994. Before becoming a CNN commentator, she worked as a criminal defense attorney.\nMel Robbins rose to prominence with her TED Talk \u201c\n.\u201d\nHer book \u201c\n\u201d written in 2017 is an international bestseller!\n\u201cStop Saying You\u2019re Fine PDF Summary\u201d\nThere are some days when you are filled with excitement, and you\u2019re ready to seize the day. The coffee smells good, and at work, you leave no stone unturned in the pursuit to make the most out of everything.\nYou are ready to go the extra mile, but how long will that last?\nIt\u2019s one of those days when you feel invincible and eager to step up regardless of the risk. \u00a0\nYes, but in the meantime, an equally powerful force holds you back, using a wide array of concealed tools.\nThis form of resistance stems from our lower version of ourselves, and it impedes the progress. The safe zone becomes the omnipresent reality and the preferred choice! You no longer have the passion for going the extra mile, and you\u2019d rather be in the \u201cknown.\u201d\nIn all honesty, resistance is winning on the long-haul.\nJust think about it for a moment.\nThe alarm goes off, and you have to jump out of bed, walk barefooted to the bathroom, get yourself ready to do a bit of morning exercising.\nWhose idea was it, in the first place? \nYou hit the snooze button, and curl up in your bed. It feels good, besides, it\u2019s just one day; it\u2019s no big deal! \nWhen that snooze button is activated, we transfer our power over to something external. Later on, you try to summon up every ounce of strength to make up for this minor setback, but you feel strangled between different expectations.\nWho wants to be stuck in a dead-end job for years? Besides, why would someone be motivated to do that kind of job? \nWell, it\u2019s not about the job, nor the performance, it\u2019s about the passion for taking control over your life.\nFeeling stuck is a very vague term.\nIt merely explains our position when there\u2019s no particular problem to be solved, but you have this sense of edginess. It seems as if something is missing, but you can\u2019t quite nail down what that is. You decide to rationalize the problem, and make excuses.\nIn all honesty, it\u2019s easier to pass up on the opportunity and turn a deaf ear to the voice of reason. In doing so, you get the load off, but at the price of abandoning your dreams.\nYou have to understand that this feeling of perpetual stuckness will not fade away on its own accord.\nWhen you enter a routine, the mind loses its creativity, and you have to suffer the consequences.\nThe same applies to marriages.\nAt first, you visualize how awesome it\u2019ll be, and you romanticize even the trivial tasks. In the foreseeable future, you find yourself just doing the same old stuff over and over again. Monotony is killing you from the inside, but on the surface, it doesn\u2019t feel like a problem at all. \nYou understand that change is inevitable, but how, when, why \u2013 all of these answerless questions can overwhelm you.\nYour life demands a challenge, something to stimulate growth but it\u2019s so hard to burst this bubble. \nWanting something from the bottom of our heart is a good first step, but without taking action, it\u2019s all for nothing. We just sit there in the corner of the room, (actionless) contemplating our life choices, and trying to find the missing link.\nTo illustrate a point, Mel puts Brian in the spotlight.\nBrian is annoyed with the way life has turned out for him. Back in college, he would have jumped into a crappy car, drive miles down the road to pay a visit to a friend, meet new people and have his ideas challenged. Now, all he has left is a meaningless job, which pays the bills. \nHe complains about the lack of intimacy with his wife Jennifer and fantasizes about Molly who has started working at the company a couple of months ago. \nAs you can see, Brian tends to pass the blame onto others. If he had realized his mistake, he would have ended things with Molly, initiated a dialogue with Jennifer, and perhaps wrote a business plan by now.\nBut sometimes, when this resistance takes over our body and mind, we start acting like jerks. Out of habit, we orchestrate an illusion that there\u2019s no alternative route. The truth is \u2013 we don\u2019t have the guts nor the audacity to make a bold move. \nDo you want a straight-out answer?\nYour \u201cstuckness\u201d has little to do with the exhausting to-do list. When simple chores pile up, we feel like not having enough free-time is the only reason for our economic and mental slump.\nIn order to \n, you have to be good at thriving under pressure.\nMel doesn\u2019t circumvent the struggle, and tells us the way things are, not how we would want them to be!\nDespite what everyone is saying, making a change is not easy. Trying something new, and getting out of the stigma that holds you imprisoned is always harder than it seems at first glance. An idea can get you all fired up, but just as easily put you in dejection when negativity rolls in.\nThese days, we have the victim-cult mentality that is practiced and embraced by many individuals. \nBearing the brunt of negativity can be very complicated, mostly because it pushes your psychological snooze buttons.\nThere\u2019s something strange about getting stuck; it looks like an epidemic we cannot outrun. The external reality never takes into account your emotional situation, and the frantic pace of the digital age only makes things worse. \nHence, it\u2019s hard to be at your best, and distinguish yourself from the herd. \nWhen you reach adulthood, you are compelled to make decisions. For some, this is a heavy burden that robs them of joy and playfulness.\nThe truth of the matter is, both internal and external tendencies instigate this sense of captivity. And it\u2019s not easy to break from the daily grind, let alone changing your whole mindset. \nThe uncertainty and the struggle create this illusion of being stuck.\nThe main thing is to resist the urge to jump on the latest bandwagon and understand how you can maintain \n.\nGauge the level of effort you put in, day in and day out, and conduct the same testing with regards to action-taking and procrastination.\nAccording to Mel, an action is only a thought brought to life.\nSo, the first thing you ought to do is quell the surge of emotions, and focus on rationally. \nMel reckons that it\u2019s hard to point out your true desires when you\u2019re immersed in your work or story. It may come as a surprise to you, but breathing new life into your ideas is not something that comes as an end result of a surreal narrative.\nFirst and foremost, we have to take a stand against the fictional approach of dealing with things. Next, we need to find out what comprises the reality.\nYou can start by taking into consideration the seven major areas of your life: \nBear in mind that nurturing positive connections with others is the backbone of life.\nHere\u2019s the step-by-step process that can help you identify which actions generate the best results, and give you support in the pursuit of fulfilling your lifelong ambitions:\nLeaning in is most definitely a philosophy that can bring about change if you understand its meaning.\nSeth\u2019s life was literally a mess. Married at a young age to a woman he barely knew, which led to a divorce. He lost half of his marital assets, and pretty much all of his friends.\nHuge problems only continued to pile up from there.\nHe had no real plan to tackle this aimless state, until one day, he had enough! So, the question was \u2013 What to do?\nHe was afraid of heights for as long as he could remember and had the \u201ccraziest\u201d idea one can come up with. He boarded a plane, wearing a jumpsuit, hooked up to the instructor, and ready to jump from 10,000 feet. However, during the flight, he got this weird feeling.\nWhat was I thinking? \u2013 No way! The instructor told him, the ride down is free, so he plucked up his courage and just went for it! \nAnd yes, he wasn\u2019t doing any insane skydiving maneuvers in midair, but he did break the ice. \nNow you might wonder, what leaning in represents?\nIt\u2019s about taking those small actions and building that momentum when the odds are against you.

And Why?\nAccording to an NPR review, \nis \u201ca book every thinking person worried about humanity\u2019s future should read.\u201d\nWe share the opinion.\nHowever, in case you expected a different answer to the question from the title, we are willing to be a bit more precise.\nSo, if you want to know what Hawking thought about the existence of God, the Big Bang, black holes, Fermi\u2019s paradox, future predictions, time travel, space colonization, AI, and/or our responsibilities in relation to the future of our planet \u2013 then this book is definitely for you.\nNow, go back to the quote from the NPR review at the beginning of this section; that one sentence was enough, wasn\u2019t it?\nAbout Stephen Hawking\n was an English theoretical physicist and cosmologist, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge for the three decades between 1979 and 2009, director of research at Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Theoretical Cosmology, and one of the most recognizable popularizers of science of the past century.\nBorn 300 years \u2013 to the day \u2013 after Galileo Galilei\u2019s death, Hawking was a brilliant student, but he fell into a deep depression after he was diagnosed with the terminal Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease (aka ALS or MND) when he was barely 21 years old.\nEven though doctors predicted that he\u2019d live no more than two years after the initial diagnosis, Hawking beat their forecasts by half a century, a period during which he developed a reputation as both an heir to Einstein and a leading public intellectual.\nAs a matter of fact, Hawking\u2019s most well-known book, \n \u2013 first published in 1988 \u2013 is one of the bestselling science books in history, having sold more than 15 million copies.\nRanked number 25 in BBC\u2019s poll of the 100 Greatest Britons in history, Stephen Hawking is widely considered the most important theoretical physicist of the past half a century, and one of the most remarkable human beings who ever lived.\n\u201cBrief Answers to the Big Questions PDF Summary\u201d\nAccording to none other than Freeman Dyson, the Holy Trinity of 20\n-century physics consists \n, \n, and Stephen Hawking.\nFew \u2013 if anyone \u2013 would argue with him.\nNot only because neither of these three needs any introduction; not even due to the fact that the last one of the three authored one of \n, \nPublished on October 16, 2018, \n\u2013 unfortunately \u2013 was the last one he ever got to write before leaving our planet.\n\u201cRegularly asked for his thoughts on the \u2018big questions\u2019 of the day by scientists, tech entrepreneurs, senior business figures, political leaders and the general public\u201d \u2013 we are told in the publisher\u2019s note \u2013 \u201cStephen maintained an enormous personal archive of his responses, which took the form of speeches, interviews and essays.\u201d\nis based on this personal archive; in development at the time of his death, the book was subsequently completed in collaboration with Hawking\u2019s academic colleagues, his family and the Stephen Hawking Estate.\nKip Thorne \u2013 a longtime friend of Hawking and \n, and the winner of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics \u2013 introduces the book thus:\nReady to go?\nKey Lessons from \u201cBrief Answers to the Big Questions\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is There a God?\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How Did It All Begin?\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is There Other Intelligent Life in the Universe?\n4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can We Predict the Future?\n5. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What Is Inside a Black Hole?\n6. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is Time Travel Possible?\n7. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Will We Survive on Earth?\n8. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Should We Colonize Space?\n9. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Will Artificial Intelligence Outsmart Us?\n10. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How Do We Shape the Future?\nIs There a God?\nIt depends on what your definition of God is.\nIf you think of God as a humanlike sentient Being who\u2019s omnipotent and omniscient \u2013 then, no, there\u2019s certainly no God.\nOr, better yet, even if there is, he has absolutely no explanatory value: the universe would have been exactly the same as it is even if he had never existed.\nThere are natural laws which govern everything and scientists throughout history have uncovered most of them, one by one, slowly but surely.\nNow we know for sure that the same laws govern both the movement of a tennis ball and the movement of a planet.\nThere\u2019s absolutely no evidence whatsoever that these laws are: a) local; b) breakable.\nIn other words, if God exists, he (or she) is also subject to this universal, permanent laws of nature.\n\u201cIf you like,\u201d writes Hawking, \u201cyou can call the laws of science \u2018God,\u2019 but it wouldn\u2019t be a personal God that you would meet and put questions to. Although, if there were such a God,\u201d he adds, \u201cI would like to ask however did he think of anything as complicated as M-theory in eleven dimensions.\u201d\nWe would too, Stephen, we would like too.\nHow Did It All Begin?\nWell, you know the simple answer: with the Big Bang.\nAfter Edwin Hubble discovered a century ago that the universe is expanding \u2013 \n \u2013 we realized that at one point in time (think 15 billion years ago) the universe was nothing more than a single dot, the primeval atom, the Cosmic Egg.\nThis primeval atom was extremely dense and hot; everything came from it.\nAnd when we say everything, we do mean \u201ceverything\u201d: time-space included.\nOf course, the fact that time and space are non-existent entities in a primeval atom (think of it as singularity: \n and \n), it\u2019s meaningless to ask what came before the Big Bang.\nIt\u2019s the same as asking what is south of the South Pole.\nThe Big Bang is the beginning \u2013 since before it time (which exists only within our universe) didn\u2019t exist.\nIs There Other Intelligent Life in the Universe?\nHave you ever heard of a little something called the Fermi paradox?\nIf not, here\u2019s (more or less) how it goes:\n\u2022 There are 200 billion stars in our galaxy only, the Milky Way;\n\u2022 By all estimations, about 20 percent of them should have an Earth-like planet orbiting them in the Goldilocks zone, \u201cwhere the distance from the star is in the right range for liquid water to exist on their surface;\u201d\n\u2022 In other words, there should be at least 40 billion potential Earths just in our cosmic neighborhood;\n\u2022 Life appeared on Earth just half a billion years after the Earth became habitable \u2013 which happened 4 billion years ago, almost 10 billion years after the Universe was formed;\n\u2022 If life needs so little time to appear on an Earth-like planet and if there are so many Earth-like planets around us \u2013 then where are the aliens?\nDifficult to answer, but there are a few things to take into consideration here:\n\u2022 First of all, there\u2019s a difference between life and intelligent life;\n\u2022 Multi-celled organisms appeared on Earth 2.5 billion years after the first single-celled organisms were formed;\n\u2022 Asteroids and comets constantly slam planets; it is one of these (and a small one, mind you) that completely wiped out the dinosaurs (the dominant species at the time) about 70 million years ago.\nSo, in other words, we might have been lucky.\nLife has probably appeared on many, many planets in our cosmic neighborhood; however, it\u2019s difficult to say if on any of them it managed to evolve to an intelligent phase.\nIts star might have become a red giant too early; asteroids might have destroyed its life forms.\nEither way, even \u201cif there is intelligent life elsewhere, it must be a very long way away otherwise it would have visited Earth by now.\u201d\nCan We Predict the Future?\n\u201cIf at one time we knew the positions and speeds of all the particles in the universe,\u201d noted once Pierre-Simon Laplace, \u201cthen we would be able to calculate their behavior at any other time in the past or future.\u201d\nIn other words, if you know the precise speed of your car and the direction it is moving, you\u2019d be able to correctly guess where it would be 30 minutes from now.\nInterestingly enough, this is the \n view of things: there\u2019s nothing supernatural in the world, so in a way, everything should be predictable.\nHowever, there are a few problems with this.\nThe two most critical: the chaos factor, and the quanta.\nFirst of all, it is highly improbable that anyone would ever know the precise position and speed of all the articles in the universe; a butterfly flapping its wings in China can cause winds in LA on a March morning, but it may cause a thunderstorm on a June evening in NY.\nPut simply: there are just too many variables and too many factors to be taken into consideration; calculations of this type, though theoretically conceivable, are impractical.\nDid we say theoretically conceivable?\nWell, \n, even that part is debatable; it seems that it is \n for us to know both the correct speed and the correct position of any small particle.\nToo bad, because we were really hoping to find something akin to Marty McFly\u2019s sports almanac one day in the future.\nOr the past.\nIt\u2019s too complicated.\nWhat Is Inside a Black Hole?\nIf you ever get there, please \u2013 be sure to tell us.\nUnfortunately, you won\u2019t be able to, because you\u2019ll be either turned into spaghetti before reaching the horizon (if it is a stellar mass black hole) or be crushed out of existence at the singularity (if it is a supermassive black hole).\nJust be sure to never reach the event horizon, aka the moment past which nothing \u2013 not even light \u2013 can escape the gravity of a black hole.\nThink of it as going over the Niagara Falls in a canoe; until a certain point, if you paddle fast enough, you should be able to get away; however, once you are past the edge, there\u2019s no way back for you.\nTo sum up:\nIf you want to explore the inside of a black hole, then be sure to choose a big one; however, you\u2019ll be the only one to know what\u2019s inside it \u2013 for a very small part of time, until, in a flash, time stops existing for you.\nIs Time Travel Possible?\nAccording to our present understanding of the universe, \u201crapid space travel and travel back in time can\u2019t be ruled out.\u201d \nIn fact, the M-theory (\u201cour best hope of uniting general relativity and quantum theory\u201d) may allow for something as extraordinary and exciting as time travel.\nHowever, if possible, time travel would cause serious logical problems, so Hawking really hopes that there\u2019s some Chronology Protection Law we know nothing about as of yet.\nEven so, he would be delighted if someone proves him wrong.\nIn fact, in 2009 he even held a party for time travelers in his college, Gonville and Caius in Cambridge.\nTo ensure that only genuine time travelers came, he didn\u2019t send out the invitations until \n the party.\nOf course, no one came on the day of the party. \n\u201cI was disappointed,\u201d writes Hawking, \u201cbut not surprised, because I had shown that if general relativity is correct and energy density is positive, time travel is not possible. I would have been delighted if one of my assumptions had turned out to be wrong.\u201d\nWill We Survive on Earth?\n that there are events which are outside and events which are within our control; unfortunately, our life here on Earth is threatened by both.\nThe biggest threat is one we can do nothing about: an asteroid collision. \u201cWe have no defense against it,\u201d says Hawking. \u201cThe last big such collision with us was about sixty-six million years ago, and that is thought to have killed the dinosaurs, and it will happen again. This is not science fiction; it is guaranteed by the laws of physics and probability.\u201d\nHowever, there are also two threats we are able to \u2013 and \n \u2013 do something about: climate change and nuclear weapons.\nHawking, however, is only partially optimistic:\nShould We Colonize Space?\nIf you read carefully Hawking\u2019s quote above, then you already know the answer: of course, we should.\nOtherwise, there\u2019s a big chance that we don\u2019t survive the next catastrophe, be it environmental or nuclear (god forbid that it is an asteroid!)\nSo, the question is not \u201cshould we colonize space?\u201d but \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhen should we start taking the matters seriously?\u201d\nHawking\u2019s answers are \u201cnow\u201d and \u201cwith concrete deadlines.\u201d\nIn his opinion, our current goals of having a moon base by 2050 and a manned Mars landing by 2070 are possible and should be the introductory chapter to a Star-Trek-like future.\nWho knows?\n when the first human colony on Mars is established.\nWill Artificial Intelligence Outsmart Us?\nAs far as Hawking is concerned, even less fabulous than the \n scenario for our future is the one depicted in \n.\nNamely, if humans became intelligent creatures by continually adapting to change, and if AI means allowing computers to do the same, shouldn\u2019t this lead to an advanced AI network reaching self-awareness sometime in the future?\nWell, chances are: it \n.\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t mean that people should stop developing AI, because, on the other hand, it may also lead to an almost utopian future for humanity.\nSo, the conclusion: AI is capable of outsmarting us, so we must develop it with caution.\nThat was the essence of an open letter signed by Hawking, Elon Musk, and a host of AI experts in 2015, in which the leaders of today warned that unless AI is deployed warily, it can have a very adverse effect on the human race.\nHow Do We Shape the Future?\nAsked \u201cwhat world-changing idea, small or big, would you like to see implemented by humanity?\u201d Hawking answers quite straightforwardly: \n\u201cThis is easy. I would like to see the development of fusion power to give an unlimited supply of clean energy, and a switch to electric cars. Nuclear fusion would become a practical power source and would provide us with an inexhaustible supply of energy, without pollution or global warming.\u201d\nReminding us that \u201cwe never really know where the next great scientific discovery will come from, nor who will make it,\u201d Hawking ends his book with a cheerful and buoyant cry addressed to just about everybody:\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cBrief Answers to the Big Questions Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nTo quote reviewer Zayan Guedim, \n\u201cis \na culmination of all of the great scientist\u2019s works, and it doesn\u2019t provide any particularly new discoveries.\u201d\nEven so, it is still \u201ceffortlessly instructive, absorbing, up to the minute and \u2013 where it matters \u2013 witty\u201d (\n).\nThe best part?\nThere\u2019s a lot of hope in Hawking\u2019s final message.\nAnd he more than deserved for us to pay attention."},

And Why?\nThe concept of a mystical dark force is often misunderstood. \nNapoleon Hill dismantles many assumptions and depicts the Devil as the negative voice in our heads. \nWith this in mind, it\u2019s crystal clear as to why we find \u201c\n\u201d to be a good fit for the broader audience. \nSociety, in general, suffers from this evil force, and it\u2019s time to put an end to the delusions.\nAbout Napoleon Hill\n is probably the founding father of the self-help genre. Some might argue otherwise, but we wholeheartedly believe that he perfected the philosophy.\nIn his books, he elaborates on the path one must cross in order to come out a winner.\nBorn in the late 19\n century, he was struck by a series of unwanted events.\nDuring that time, Napoleon conducted the largest success study ever undertaken by someone. Most of its findings are incorporated into his bestselling books:\n\u201cOutwitting the Devil PDF Summary\u201d\nNapoleon Hill is renowned for his endeavors in the pursuit of truth and finding the formula for success.\nIn 1908, he met Andrew Carnegie (one of the world\u2019s wealthiest people throughout history) and expressed a desire to enroll in Law School.\nMr. Carnegie was surprised to hear that Hill planned to get his degree by interviewing successful people and writing their stories in magazines.\nMr. Carnegie pointed out that if he wants to be of service to all people, and posterity as well, he must also underline the causes for failure.\nThe world is in need of a practical and philosophical explanation of achievement and loss.\nIf you are eager to undertake this job, you must interview not only those who succeeded but also those who have failed.\nA real wake-up call for young Napoleon.\nIn the following years, Napoleon managed to interview approximately 25,000 people (perceived as failures), and around 500 (successes).\nDuring that time, he also became aware of the concept of an emergency.\nMr. Carnegie taught him that somewhere along the path, he\u2019d get a glimpse on how people\u2019s habits change in case of crisis or tension.\nAnd that was the missing link in his research.\nIt all was predicated on the fact that any emergency will lead to an opportunity. It\u2019s safe to say that at the end of the research Napoleon had his Eureka moment.\nYou can call this the \u201cOther Self\u201d but bear in mind that it cannot do the work on your behalf. It can only guide you through the stream of thoughts and help you to understand the natural impulses of nature.\nThe faith yet again rests on your shoulders.\nDo you know that the darkest hour is just before the dawn? \u2013 Don\u2019t give up, even when things get unbearably difficult.\nIt came clear to Napoleon that finding and understanding the \u201cOther Self\u201d can alleviate us from all the pain and suffering. \nEverything you need will come to you; it seemed that way for Napoleon Hill.\nIt all boils down to the reality that the whole world is driven by fear, cultural limitations, and meaningless education. \nDoubt and negligence are at the core of our decision-making, and we don\u2019t seem to care.\nIf you don\u2019t conform to this law, and If you disregard the notion of the \u201cOther Self\u201d you\u2019ll be left in blindness. It\u2019s impossible to galvanize a person into action, who espouses beliefs that are limiting human creativity. \nThe state of one\u2019s mind, known as faith, circumvents the restrictive nature of the five physical senses and communicates with the infinite source of power. This book gives us a run-through of the whole process, and how the Devil exerts influence over you.\nDuring the interview with the Devil, you\u2019ll be dragged into an inner discussion. Knowing how to outmaneuver this skillful opponent is going to be decisive. In the meantime, you\u2019ll catch a glimpse of the Devil\u2019s nature, and its bag of tricks.\nAre you ready for the interview Mr. Devil?\n Yes, but only if you address me as \u201cYour Majesty\u201d?\n Why on Earth would I do that?\n Because I control 98% of the world, and there\u2019s nothing you can do! I am the majority, that\u2019s why.\n: Alright! Let\u2019s begin. Where do you live?\nI am not bounded to any form, and have no physical appearance. I accumulate all of the negative energy consisting of fears, beliefs, and limitations.\nAbove all else, I occupy \u00bd of every atom.\n: You are saying that without your influence, there would be no world, changes, emotions, stars?\nExactly! \n:\nI\u2019ve been led to understand that you occupy only half of everything. To whom does the second half belong to?\nMy enemy or the opposition should you prefer.\n: Your Majesty, could you tell us a little bit more about the process of controlling 98% of the earthbound creatures?\n It all started thousands of years ago when people began to think. I plant my seeds of fear in the minds of people and force them to perceive these sensations as if they are their own creation. Someone might call it a deft maneuver, but it\u2019s simply a good strategy to maintain control.\n: Time and space are completely irrelevant, is that correct?\n By all means! I choose the place of battle, and because of my abstract nature, I cannot be wiped out, not in a million years.\n: What about your opponent, isn\u2019t he a threat to your existence?\n Well, not quite, since the opposition controls the positive forces which society deems unrealistic. You see, I don\u2019t want to control the Universe, just my human slaves, by pulling the strings.\n: Who is your greatest adversary on Earth?\n Those who inspire earthbound creatures to think outside the box. I can even name a few: Socrates, Emerson, Thomas Paine, and Abraham Lincoln.\n: Do you have another thing to add, Your Majesty?\n Cigarettes are also a tool that helps me to hold society in a stranglehold and keep it there permanently.\n: Your Majesty, you are the worst thing that has ever descended upon the Earth. However, I am keen to know, are you are willing to cut those people loose? \nGive up on your power? \n In that regard, I am helpless, and it\u2019s not up to me! It\u2019s the minds of my prisoners which have to reject me, not vice versa.\nHere are the seven principles you need to adhere to in order to attain spiritual, financial and emotional maturity:\nDon\u2019t get too analytical over these principles.\nIf you digest their essential message, you wouldn\u2019t be compelled to memorize them. Above all else, you must not roam around aimlessly!\nOnly then, you\u2019ll be able to think about environmental, and sociological hurdles that may hamper your progress.\n: What one has to do in order to find its life purpose?\n One must strive hard not to lose control over itself. But I can say with some confidence that most people succumbed to the negative pressure, and took a psychological beating. \n: So, how can one be in a position to regain power?

Hansen teaches you how to be:\nWho Should Read \u201cGreat at Work\u201d? And Why?\nA management professor at the University of California, Morten T. Hansen is probably best known as the co-author (with the ever-great Jim Collins) of \n, widely considered one of the greatest books on how to build a successful company in a dynamic, unpredictable and tumultuous age such as the 21\n century.\n is a sort of a sequel to \n(which was, in turn, a sequel to \n), translating some of its advices in the language of individual performance and personal excellence.\nOnce again based on an extensive study, \nis nothing short of a \u201cgroundbreaking book\u201d and should be read by anyone interested in becoming a better performer at work.\nEven more: we strongly encourage everyone to implement Hansen\u2019s seven \u201cWork Smarter\u201d practices in his work career and life.\nThat\u2019s one decision you\u2019ll never regret.\nAbout Morten T. Hansen\n is a Norwegian-American management theorist and management professor at the University of California, Berkeley.\nAfter obtaining an MSc in Accounting and Finance from the London School of Economics, Hansen won a Fulbright Scholarship and went on to earn a Ph.D. in Business Administration at Stanford University.\nAt Stanford, Hansen also received the Jaedicke award for outstanding academic performance, one of the seven he has so far received for his scholarly research, the most prestigious among them perhaps the 2005 Administrative Science Quarterly award and the 2005 Sloan Management Review/Pricewaterhouse Coopers Award.\nRanked by Thinkers50 among the 50 most influential management thinkers today, Hansen has so far authored two books (\n and \n) and co-authored one with Jim Collins (\n).\nTo find out more, visit \n. \n\u201cGreat at Work PDF Summary\u201d\nMorten Hansen is not only a co-author of \n but also sort of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Jim Collins; so, no surprises when it comes to the methodology behind this book: \ntries to give a simple answer to a complicated question via an extensive, wide-ranging study.\nThe question: \nWhy do some people perform great at work while others don\u2019t?\nThe study:\n200 published academic articles; in-depth interviews with 120 professionals and a survey study of 5,000 managers and employees, representing 15 industry sectors and 22 job functions.\nThe results:\nThe difference between the superstars and their peers are seven \u201cwork smart\u201d practices:\n: \u201cselect a tiny set of priorities and make huge efforts in those chosen areas;\u201d\n: \u201cfocus on creating value, not just reaching preset goals;\u201d\n: \u201ceschew mindless repetition in favor of better skills practice;\u201d\n: \u201cseek roles that match your passion with a strong sense of purpose;\u201d\n: \u201cshrewdly deploy influence tactics to gain the support of others;\u201d\n: \u201ccut back on wasteful team meetings, and make sure that the ones you do attend spark vigorous debate;\u201d\n: \u201ccarefully pick which cross-unit projects to get involved in, and say no to less productive ones.\u201d\nThe first four practices relate to mastering your own work; the latter three to mastering working with others.\nHansen explains each of them in the rest of the book.\nPart I: Mastering Your Own Work\n\u201cThe conventional wisdom,\u201d reminds us Hansen, \u201cstates that people who work harder and take on more responsibilities accomplish more and perform better.\u201d\nThe data, however, doesn\u2019t support this view:\nAs you can see from the table above, managers who \u201cdo less, then obsess\u201d perform a whopping 25 percentage points (on average) better than those who perform more, and then stress.\nAccording to Hansen, because of this, this strategy is \n most potent practice among the seven discussed in the book.\nThe problem is that \nresults in two traps:\n\u2022 The \n, aka taking on many tasks and being unable to allocate enough attention to each;\n\u2022 The \n, \u201cthe energy required to manage the interrelationship between tasks leads people to waste time and execute poorly.\u201d\nIf you want to implement the \u201cdo less, then obsess\u201d strategy in practice, then use these three ways:\n\u2022 \n: shave away unnecessary tasks and focus on the remaining ones;\n\u2022 \n: set clear rules beforehand which will ensure that you\u2019ll never procrastinate (e.g., don\u2019t allow yourself to check your email for certain periods of time);\n\u2022 \n: put limits; when your to-do list looks too much, it probably is; explain to your boss that accepting any other assignment will affect your performance; he/she will understand.\nThe more hours you work, the better you perform.\n50 hours a week is just enough; counterintuitively, anything more will impede progress and performance; so, redesign your work.\nYou should rarely work more than 50 hours a week, aka about 8 hours for 6 days; according to Hansen\u2019s study, sometimes, working up to 65 hours has some benefits, but just slight; working more than 65 hours is actually detrimental.\nInstead of extending your workday, it\u2019s much better to redesign it.\nThere are five ways you can do this:\n\u2022\u00a0\n: get rid of activities of little value;\n\u2022\u00a0\n: increase activities of high value;\n\u2022\u00a0\n: create new activities of this latter kind; \n\u2022\u00a0\n: improve quality;\n\u2022\u00a0\n: do some activities more efficiently.\nAs Malcolm Gladwell taught us in \n, 10,000 hours of practice is all you need to master a particular discipline; repetition is the mother of learning \u2013 says \n.\nHansen\u2019s conclusion:\nIn other words, it\u2019s not the number of hours that matters; it\u2019s the quality of practice; it\u2019s not \n, but merely \n.\nInstead of the 10,000-hour rule, adhere to the Learning Loop rule; namely, focus on the quality of iterations and not the sheer number of them.\nThis is how the basic steps in a Learning Loop look like:\nThe reason why people believe that repetition is the mother of learning is that most of the studies in deliberate practice have treated areas such as music, chess, sports \u2013 all of them memory-related.\nIt\u2019s different in the business world.\nHansen suggests six tactics to implement the learning loop in your job:\n: every single day, spend 15 minutes to better one of your skills;\n: break your desired skill into daily \n; \n: trace the micro-behaviors;\n: solicit brief, informal feedback from your peers;\n: conduct small experiments;\n: de-automate your routines.\nThey say that if you do what you love, success will inevitably come your way.\nPassion is not enough; you need to match it with a strong sense of purpose; hence the P-squared.\nMany people are passionate about what they do; the ones who excel among them excel because they attach a much nobler purpose to their passion.\nIf you do not feel that you\u2019ve achieved this, you can expand your passion and sense of purpose via these three tactics:\n\u2022\u00a0\n. You don\u2019t need to find another job; you can expand your passion and purpose just by finding a different role in your existing company;\n\u2022\u00a0\n. Passion is the result of several factors \u2013 not just taking pleasure in the work; it can also come from your success, social interactions, learning, competence, and creativity. \u201cExpand your circle of passion by tapping into these dimensions,\u201d says Hansen.\n\u2022 \n.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u25cb Add more value to your activities;\n \u00a0\u00a0\u25cb Pursue personally meaningful activities, regardless of other people\u2019s opinion;\n \u00a0\u00a0\u25cb Pursue activities which have a clear and sound social mission.\nPart II: Mastering Working with Others\nJust argue rationally for your ideas, explain the wonderful merits of your case, and you\u2019ll undoubtedly overcome all the opposition to your work efforts.\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned that people will forget what you said,\u201d wrote once Maya Angelou, \u201cpeople will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\u201d \nWell, Hansen\u2019s study vindicates Angelou: the best performers deploy the \n maneuver, evoking emotions in individuals whose support they need and tailoring tactics in the face of opposition.\nForceful champions inspire others in one of these three ways:\n\u2022 They make them excited for tomorrow and angry about today;\n\u2022 They use striking photos: \n;\n\u2022 They make people \n resolute, connecting their day-to-day activities to a grander purpose.\nIn addition, forceful champions display \n in at least one of these five ways:\n\u2022 They stand in the shoes of their opponents;\n\u2022 They confront them when necessary;\n\u2022 They make concessions they can live with to appease their opponents;\n\u2022 They co-opt opponents;\n\u2022 They mobilize people (see above) to advocate on their behalf.\nMeeting fights and disagreements bring about discord which spills over other meetings; that\u2019s why fights should be avoided, and only the best and the brightest should be heard.\nFights are a necessary product of good team debate; follow-up meetings are unnecessary when you fight and unite well enough.\nTo have a productive fight during a meeting, use one of these five strategies:\n\u2022\u00a0Maximize diversity, not talent\n\u2022\u00a0Make it safe to speak up\n\u2022\u00a0Prod the quiet to speak\n\u2022\u00a0Show up as an advocate, not a salesperson\n\u2022\u00a0Ask nonleading questions.\nTo improve the unity at the end, try the following:\n\u2022\u00a0Ensure everyone has a voice (being heard creates buy-in)\n\u2022\u00a0Commit, especially when you utterly disagree\n\u2022\u00a0Confront the prima donna\n\u2022\u00a0Sharpen the team goal\n\u2022\u00a0Stop playing office politics and get behind decisions.\nThe more collaboration, the better.\nActually:\nBoth overcollaboration and undercollaboration are detrimental to success; to achieve balance, you need disciplined collaboration.\nIt consists of the following five rules:\n\u2022 If a collaboration initiative seems questionable, say no; if not \u2013 say yes;\n\u2022 Craft a unifying goal for everybody;\n\u2022 Reward the collaborating people only for the results \u2013 not for the activities;\n\u2022 Commit everything to the collaboration; if you can\u2019t \u2013 then kill it;\n\u2022 Tailor trust boosters to specific trust problems in the relationship.\nPart III: Mastering Your Work-Life\nWe\u2019ll try to summarize this chapter in three charts, each answering the three questions Hansen posits here.\nAs you can see, even p-squared worsens work-life balance (by about 4%), and \u201cdo less, then obsess\u201d improves it the most (by 26%).\nOnce again, do less, then obsess is the best strategy to go!\nAll \u201csmart work\u201d practices improve job satisfaction; unsurprisingly, p-squared the most.\nEpilogue\nMorten T. Hansen conclusion is pretty straightforward: anyone can become a top performer.\nTrue, effort, talent, and luck all play their parts, but these seven practices statistically have played a more important part than anything else.\nIn fact, that\u2019s the very first graph in this book, but we decided to put it here so that you understand the importance of these seven practices better:\nAny questions?\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cGreat at Work Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nJim Collins says that \u201cMorten Hansen delivers on the genius of \n: rigorous and relevant, research-driven and well-written, empirical and empowering, timeless and practical, full of big concepts and useful tips. Hansen\u2019s work is truly distinctive in the genre of professional effectiveness, and a tremendous contribution. This is a book I will read more than once, and reference forever.\u201d\nNamed by \nas one of the \u201c\n\u201d even before it had been published, \nis undoubtedly destined to be included in similar lists in the future.At least we should have no second thoughts including it one of our future \u201c\n\u201d lists; in fact, we\u2019re kinda sad that we happened upon it a bit too late to include it in the one linked in this sentence.\n\n"},

And Why?\nAt first, we weren\u2019t quite sure that we understood the message emanating from this book. From the looks of it, it seemed as if Nassim had scattered a bunch of things and quotes without any natural flow. \nBut we were wrong.\n is genuine in its entirety, and it covers everything pretty much every aspect of an ordinary person\u2019s life.\nTherefore, we wholeheartedly recommend it to the general audience, with a promise of an excellent, and enlightening read. \nAbout Nassim Nicholas Taleb\n is an acclaimed author and a prominent personality whose work brings to light the elements of randomness, probability, risk-taking, and uncertainty.\nApart from unearthing some misconceptions related to the likelihood of something happening, he also excels as an essayist, scholar, and statistician.\nHe has received both his bachelor and master degree from the University of Paris; and has a Ph.D. in Management Science.\nNassim is also the author of several best-selling books:\n\u201cThe Bed of Procrustes PDF Summary\u201d\nProcrustes, in Greek mythology, describes a vicious owner living in Attica who was renowned for his unusual hospitality. He kidnapped travelers, took them to his home, fed them, and then invited them to get a good night\u2019s rest in his rather special bed. \nMeanwhile, he was obsessed into making the bed fit the traveler to absolute perfection. Those who were tall, had their legs chopped off, while those who were quite short for his standards, were stretched until there were no imperfections. \nAccording to some sources, the name of this \u201cgenerous\u201d host was Damastes. \nIn addition to this, you can also find another version of this somewhat mythological tale. In the Pseudo-Apollodorus\u2019s Bibliotheca, Procrustes had two beds, one small and one large. The beds depict the limited knowledge of society and the fear of the unknown.\nOnce you get into reading, you\u2019ll get the idea of why Nassim uses aphorism to illustrate a point.\nRemember aphorisms lose their appeal when explained, so we distill the essential meaning into this summary to make them more digestible.\nHowever, we try not to engage ourselves in explaining the symbolic meaning.\nLet\u2019s start with probably the most controversial but dead-on aphorism:\nTo pick it up from here, he also asserts that education can make the wise one wiser, but the fool very dangerous. \nIdeas are not conceptual thoughts that don\u2019t have predecessors, but a blend of rather incompatible ones. \nWe can see clearly that Nassim is very critical of the way we absorb information. \nHe also points out that modernity has taken a toll on humanity, and further impugns our capacity to make the world a better place. \nThose who can\u2019t see past their nose tend to conflate religion with a belief-system. The same people who struggle to distinguish between system and free will, claim to be speaking on behalf of society, which is quite ironic.\nNassim even sheds light on procrastination, as a method in which the soul tries to break the chains of imprisonment. But yeah, as it is with most other things, nobody has the temerity to exercise radical transparency, especially not to himself/herself.\nHow to deal with a liar?\nBy accepting his/her remarks! That seems like a cruel punishment, but it\u2019s exactly what could turn the tables around.\nHowever, we came to the conclusion that saying \u201cNo\u201d is not an easy task, especially when you mean it. \nBear in mind that: \nPeople prefer to nurture their shallow sense of self and be successful. \nWhen it comes to wisdom, society kind of puts it on the same page with academia. In other words, we tend to adopt the same attitude, when these two are under scrutiny.\nNassim also cast light on the fragility of temporary deals, and the permanency of the so-called temporary ones. It kind of portrays humans as inconsistent in their desires, and pretty much restless in their deal-making pursuits.\nHe goes on by saying:\nWell, hatred is not easy to conceal and put it under the carpet.\nBut, when we find ourselves engaged in some topic, ideas have this magical power to be multiplied and shared openly. \nSociety has a hard time defining both success and failure. As oscillating terms, we find it hard to accept an absolute definition and evaluate our efforts based on it. \nOne of the key elements towards stoic freedom is the unbreakable urge to refuse being wrapped up in chains. \nHowever, people have been deluded that the opposite of being a slave, is owning one. \nThe slave thing has symbolic meaning because it applies to our devotion towards a certain system without questioning its utterances.\nPaying the price for freedom is too much for some people.\nKarl Marx even discovered that the best way to control a slave is convincing him that he is an employee. Great analogy and pretty accurate depiction of how the slave-business is conducted \u2013 masked as a form of empowerment.\nLet\u2019s give thought to happiness, as a concept.\nThat\u2019s a hell of a thing to say, and only a small portion of the people have the audacity to implement it, thoroughly.\nAnd yes, success is probably the journey from the \u201chating\u201d to the \u201chated.\u201d\nSo, who should we follow, do we need role models, to begin with?\nIt\u2019s much easier to find anti-models who exhibit behavior you don\u2019t wish to emulate, than people whose actions are in line with your view of the world.\nDo we need to apologize for our wrongdoings? All the time, except when you are sincerely wrong. \nIf the 20\n century is remembered for its failure to produce a social utopia, the 21\n will be known for its technological demise. \nThe true measurement of success is the one that revolves around the concept of time. How much time, effort, and skills are you willing to put in?\nSome dress to impress an entire group of people, whilst others do it to impress that single person that means to them.\nWhatever you\u2019ve learned on your own, would be the thing that never fades away.\nTrue love merely celebrates the win over the universal and the unconditional over the conditional. \nUniversal is protected by the manipulative nature of the human conditioning, and that gives us the impetus to exercise control over our surroundings. \nRandomness, however, is rarely taken into account.\nOn top of that, friendship or nurturing relationships with other people as a process is pretty much debatable. If you try to find a reason for being friends with someone, you are on the wrong path.\nPolite disdain is another word for hatred, embraced by those who believe in high-achievement.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Bed of Procrustes\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The spread of rumors\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The power of an apology\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Slavery with another name\nThe spread of rumors\nThe truth of the matter is that rumors are only valuable when they are debunked or challenged with facts. \nThis denial serves as a shield or a bulwark against those who intend to neglect the moral principles of the community. \nWhen it comes to gossiping and whispers, you are much more likely to fool yourself than others. \nThe power of an apology\nDo you know that people who have a habit to apologize for everything, only intend to do it again? On the second thought, why would they even try to make amends for their behavior, if they only repeat it once you turn your back?\nAsk you can see, every apology should be taken with caution because real words are the ones springing from actions.\nSlavery with another name\nThe main distinction between slaves and tech-geeks is that slaves are fully aware of their imprisonment. To some extent, we are all dragged into this mainstream prison; but there\u2019s a way out.\nFirst and foremost, you have to be sharp and attentive to spot the danger.\nNext, you ought to take appropriate follow-up actions.\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free \n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Bed of Procrustes Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nNassim Taleb is one of those intellectuals who never disappoints. \nAphorisms presented here, are by all accounts breathtaking and truthful.

And Why?\nis one of a few essential and popular books dealing with our decision-making process\nIf you know and like any of them \u2013 \n, \n, \n\u2013 then you\u2019ll enjoy this one.\nIf not, please, have a look at \nof them.\nAbout Jonah Lehrer\n is an American author.\nA Rhodes scholar, he published three bestselling non-fiction books by the age of 30 \u2013 \n, \n,\nand \n \u2013 and was widely deemed a successor to Malcolm Gladwell in more aspects than one.\nHowever, from 2012 onward, it was discovered that Lehrer had recycled his work, plagiarized colleagues, and misquoted other authors.\nSince then, both \n and \n have been recalled from the shelves, and his final book, \n, has met with negative reviews.\nFind out more at \n. \n\u201cHow We Decide PDF Summary\u201d\nAs the title suggests, Jonah Lehrer\u2019s \nexplores the science behind decision-making, one of the numerous books to do so in the last decade \u2013 as we have implied in our \n section above.\nLehrer\u2019s book opens with a very indicative epigraph, which we feel is apt and relevant enough to be quoted in full.\nIt\u2019s taken from Don DeLillo\u2019s \n and it goes like this:\nWell, that\u2019s precisely what \nis all about: those unimportant places in your brain hemispheres that make your decisions for you \u2013 even when you\u2019re so sure that you\u2019re in control.\nDon\u2019t believe us?\nBelieve our summary of Lehrer\u2019s book.\nChapter 1: The Quarterback in the Pocket\nAs you can see below, this article was published just one day after Super Bowl LIII \u2013 the most boring one in recent history \u2013 ended, and in a somewhat expected manner: the Patriots defeating the Rams and Tom Brady, once again, lifting the Super Bowl trophy.\nCoincidentally, Lehrer\u2019s book begins with a recollection of Super Bowl XXXVI, contested by the same two teams and concluded in a much the same manner.\nThe only differences: the Rams, the Greatest Show on Turf, were the runaway favorites back in 2002 (not that they weren\u2019t favorites this year as well), and Tom Brady was just a back-up QB for the Patriots, expected to be the Hall of Famer that he is now by absolutely no one.\nAfter all, he was the 199\n draft pick (in Round 6!) just two years before that and was deemed to lack \u201cgreat physical stature and strength\u201d in the \n draft report.\nThe report did get one thing right: Brady, it said, excels at decision-making.\nAs you know full well, the NFL has a way to check \n with a test: the Wonderlic test.\nBrady\u2019s score: 33. \nNot bad, considering that it\u2019s twice as much as Dan Marino (16) and a third more than Brett Favre (22); however, certainly not as good as Ryan Fitzpatrick\u2019s 48 (in 9 minutes) or Jason Maas\u2019 43!\nBut why are Brady, Marino, and Favre the record-holders?\nBecause, says Lehrer, the Wonderlic test is somewhat flawed.\nSimply put, it sees decision-making as something done with the rational part of our brains; the truth is, that\u2019s merely half of the truth.\nYou see, our brain consists of both a limbic (emotional) part and a neo-cortex (logical) segment; and we use both to make a decision.\nLet\u2019s see how.\nChapter 2: The Predictions of Dopamine\nThe reason why Tom Brady is so good at making the right decisions when in the pocket \u2013 i.e., when he has to make a decision in two or three seconds \u2013 is because in addition to analyzing and remembering thousands of plays before the game, he is also capable of deactivating the part which studied and absorbed them during it.\nIn a nutshell, that\u2019s the story of making the right decisions.\nContrary to what Plato and Descartes believed and advocated, it isn\u2019t right to always think a decision through; when you need to make a decision in a split second \u2013 you should always go with your guts.\nYou know why?\nBecause your emotions are genuinely empirical as well; after all, they too have evolved during a period of hundreds of thousands of years.\nAnd you owe your competence to something called \u201cthe dopamine feedback system,\u201d which functions by detecting subtle patterns that you\u2019d otherwise fail to notice.\nDopamine neurons \u201cassimilate all the data that we can\u2019t consciously comprehend. And then, once they come up with a set of refined predictions about how the world works, they translate these predictions into emotions.\u201d\nThis was demonstrated by Antonio Damasio in the \n, popularized in his aptly titled book \n.\nIn short, thanks to dopamine releases, people pick up the patterns in a rigged game of cards even though they consciously have no idea what the pattern is.\nPeople who suffer from orbitofrontal cortex dysfunctions, however, have problems doing this.\nSurprise, surprise:\nThe orbitofrontal cortex is related to emotions and reward systems in decision-making processes!\nChapter 3: Fooled by a Feeling\nBut, be aware: your emotional brain is not perfect and, unfortunately, it is programmed in such a manner that if you adhere to its rules too much of the time, it will undoubtedly lead you on the wrong path.\nThe reason?\nThere are at least three:\n\u2022 First of all, as we suggested above, the emotional brain is preprogrammed to see patterns; however, as Taleb taught us well (or at least tried to teach us), it can be easily \n. Gambling streaks or hot hands in basketball are not real: they are just your emotional brain seeing patterns where there are none.\n\u2022 Secondly, as Tversky and Kahneman showed us, the brain is much more interested in avoiding losses than winning; for the brain, \u201cbad is stronger than good,\u201d because even though winning releases dopamine, losing activates the amygdala which in turn makes you feel fear and anxiety;\n\u2022 Finally, due to the power of dopamine, the emotional brain always favors short-term rewards and disregards long-term costs; dopamine is fired three or four times the usual amount when you win something unexpectedly; and now you know why you keep gambling even after you\u2019ve lost everything.\nIn a nutshell, the emotional brain keeps you focused \u2013 and sometimes this can be a problem.\nChapter 4: The Uses of Reason\nOf course, the neocortex, the rational part of your brain, is here to help.\nYou see, being focused means ignoring many things which don\u2019t matter and directing all of your energy only on the ones which do.\nHowever, what if you\u2019re focused on the wrong thing? Well, then it\u2019s almost certain that you\u2019ll make not only wrong but the \n decision.\nThink of the last time you panicked about something.\nA few things happened inside you, the most important of which was \n: you ignored everything but one thing.\nIt usually works like this: earthquake = significant threat = I need to run away.\nHowever, your emotional brain is far from correct in this case: you can try to run away from a dog, but you can\u2019t run away from an earthquake.\nIn cases such as these, in order to think straight \u2013 science tells us \u2013 you need to regulate your emotions.\nHow do you do that?\nSo, in a way, science has vindicated Aristotle who argued, in \nthat \u201cthe key to cultivating virtue was learning how to manage one\u2019s passions.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not about getting angry; it\u2019s about getting angry to the right and at the right time.\nChapter 5: Choking on Thought\nFrom Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s essay \u201c\n\u201d\n\u2013 recapitulated as part of our \n \u2013 we learned that choking is the failure of \n things you\u2019ve otherwise mastered.\nWell, that\u2019s the foundational one of the few flaws your rational brain is intrinsically peppered with.\nLet\u2019s look at the most important ones:\n\u2022 The thinking mind works best when working with small amounts of data; you can remember the last seven things someone says, plus or minus two; anything more than that, overburdens your rational brain and inspires it to oversimplify things and, consequently, make mistakes because of it;\n\u2022 There \n such thing as TMI: your rational brain makes a decision based on merely small chunks of data and uses everything else to support the initial decision;\n\u2022 Just as your emotional brain is too constricted, your rational brain is too open: it can\u2019t ignore any information, no matter how irrelevant; that\u2019s why it\u2019s pretty open to suggestions;\n\u2022 As you have experienced so many times in your life, your rational brain tires easily; \n\u2022 Perhaps the strangest thing about your rational brain: it\u2019s illogical. Here\u2019s a great example: would you drive 20 miles to save $5 on a calculator worth $15? You probably would. Now, would you do the same to save $5 on a $125 jacket? You probably won\u2019t. Even though, $5 is $5 either way.\nChapter 6: The Moral Mind\nWe mentioned Aristotle\u2019s \n above, one of the foundational books on the moral mind.\nWhat does science have to say about it?\nWell, strangely enough, that no matter how much you try, your moral decisions are usually made by the emotional part of your brain; the prefrontal cortex usually provides the reasons for it \n.\nWhat does this mean in a nutshell?\nA few things:\n\u2022 First of all, that data and stats would never work as much as something directly related to your emotions; Paul Slovic, for example, discovered that one photograph of a malnourished child inspired people to give much more money (about twice as much) than a whole poster of very real and frightening facts;\n\u2022 Statistics have no effect on our moral decisions \u2013 they are all about sympathy; in a way, Stalin was right: as far as our brains are concerned, a single death is a tragedy; a million deaths are a statistic.\n\u2022 Mother Theresa said this better: \u201cIf I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will;\u201d \n.\n\u2022 If you can\u2019t see the person you\u2019re unfair to \u2013 you will almost certainly have no sympathy for him or her.\t\nChapter 7: The Brain is an Argument\nThe conclusion?\nInside your brain, there\u2019s a constant argument between different parts of it.\nBut that\u2019s a great thing!\nWhen there is none, then you\u2019re a close-minded person, an ideologue, someone who is capable of rationalizing any fact to fit your own system of beliefs.\nSince that\u2019s the worst thing that can happen to you, it\u2019s best to encourage inner discord and try to test your opinions from time to time.\nWe learn best through trial and error.\nChapter 8: The Poker Hand\nSpeaking of \u2013\nNo matter how much you try, you\u2019ll never be able to avoid errors; you\u2019re simply not designed to.\nHowever, you can minimize them by following these simple strategies:\n\u2022 When you need to make an easy decision, then it\u2019s better to never go with your guts; \n spend some time reflecting and analyzing; however, don\u2019t overthink it either;\n\u2022 When you need to make a difficult decision, then the best strategy is to gather all the information you can, absorb it and then forget all about it; make the decision after a while, in a split second, using nothing but your intuition.\nKey Lessons from \u201cHow We Decide\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Your Brain Consists of Both an Emotional and a Rational Part\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You Need Both Your Brain and Your Emotions to Make a Decision\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Think Over Easy Decision; for Difficult Ones \u2013 Go with Your Guts\nYour Brain Consists of Both an Emotional and a Rational Part\nPlato and Descartes believed that the reason why we make so many mistakes in our lives when making a decision is that we don\u2019t use our rational selves as much as necessary.\nHowever, science has found out that this is not true: in addition to the neocortex, the limbic brain (which deals with our emotions) plays a large part in our decision-making processes.\nDon\u2019t believe us?\nWell, people who have suffered injuries in the limbic brain are incapable of making a decision.\nYou Need Both Your Brain and Your Emotions to Make a Decision\nIf you use your rational brain too much, then there\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019ll be fooled by irrelevant suggestions or/and you\u2019ll eventually choke.\nIf, however, you exclusively use your emotional brain, then you might start seeing patterns all around you and start preferring illogical short-term gains despite the long-term price.\nThe key to making a good decision lies in the balance between the two: regulating your emotions when necessary and letting them run riot when not.\n\u201cPeople who are more rational,\u201d says Benedetto de Martino, \u201cdon\u2019t perceive emotion less, they just regulate it better.\u201d\nThink Over Easy Decision; for Difficult Ones \u2013 Go with Your Guts\nWhen making an easy decision, always prefer the rational part of your brain to your guts.\nWhen making a difficult one, however \u2013 to quote Ap Dijksterhuis \u2013\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cHow We Decide Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nDespite all the negative publicity after the \n, \nhas its merits. \nAnd we believe that you\u2019ll find at least parts of it engaging and thought-provoking.\nDefinitely worth a read."},

Let\u2019s go?\n\u201cTraction PDF Summary\u201d\nIf you have a startup, what matters most is getting to the customers. You need to master acquisition channels and thus prove the real growth of your business. Many beginner entrepreneurs believe that a good product sells itself.\nUnfortunately, this is not true. You need consistent growth. You need traction.\nYou need a systematic approach, a method to keep growing and each time attracting more customers. Do not blindly repeat the techniques and tactics adopted by other companies.\nDo not make ads or just create a blog because other companies are creating it. If you keep trying to grow without a clear strategy, you will end up broke, with no money and no users.\nThe method and plan are as important as the growth itself, and that is what Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares bring us in Traction.\nTraction means you can acquire new customers in a predictable and scalable way. Imagine that you have launched a product and are beginning to acquire users. Growth is coming slowly, but it is difficult to control. These are initial signs of traction.\nYour traction is measured by an indicator whose goal is to help you scale and scale your business. If you sell to businesses (B2B) for example, the first large contracts closed can be a traction indicator.\nIf your focus is on reaching the end consumer, traction can mean having to acquire thousands or hundreds of thousands of users.\nYour traction should be measured by a clear, easy-to-follow indicator that should always be pointing up and to the right, after all, a startup exists to grow and traction.\nThere are dozens of channels and strategies adopted by companies to grow and you, \n, need to know how to prioritize them.\nOnly constant experiments and a lot of effort will tell you which ones are best for your startup.\n(function(d,id){if(d.getElementById(id))return;var scr=d.createElement(\u2018script\u2019);scr.src=\u2019https://widget.12min.com/v0.2.0/widget.js\u2019;scr.id=id;d.body.appendChild(scr);})(document,\u201912min-widget-sdk\u2019);window.twelveminInit=function twelveminInit(){};\n\nIn this micro book, we will explore the 19 channels of customer acquisition most commonly used by startups from around the world.\nHaving a great product without a traction strategy is a common mistake, and every entrepreneur needs to avoid it. In a startup, customer acquisition must always be played in parallel with the development of the product itself.\nYou cannot expect your product to be ready to go. You need to divide your time between product development and demand generation for it.\nDedicate 50% of your time to the product itself and focus the remaining 50% on making sure your product is reaching users.\nTo have traction, you need a product that people enjoy, but without traction, you will not be able to know if people really like your product. That is why it is essential that both go hand in hand.\nGrowing a startup is challenging, and they all start with slow growth. In the beginning, you need to do things that do not scale, and that is extremely manual.\nAfter this phase, the company begins to have a more consistent growth, associated with the discovery of a first associated channel. When this channel becomes saturated, growth slows down, and it is time to find new channels.\nTherefore, Gabriel and Justin propose a method of channel discovery called the Bullseye framework.\nFor startups, at different times in their life cycle, different channels need to be used. The Bullseye framework helps the entrepreneur find the right channel for a company as it stands.\nThe Bullseye is a model visually represented by a target, with 3 tracks. There are 3 concentric circles, and each represents an important part of the process of searching for new channels. These include:\nThe entrepreneur must always focus on the main channel and, at each stage of the business, there is a channel that should receive more attention, after all, it brings the majority of customers. Gabriel suggests that you always focus on one channel at a time.\nBy focusing on multiple channels, the effort of the entrepreneur (who already has few resources) is diluted, and this makes the company have multiple acquisition channels malfunctioning, without optimization.\nBy focusing on only one, it is possible to optimize that channel to the maximum until its saturation, so that other channels can be prioritized.\nTo achieve traction, you need to use the Bullseye framework to identify the channels most likely to bring growth to a startup. That\u00a0is done through continuous testing. Select the channels in the middle of the Bullseye, and do little experiments to see if those channels are really promising and deserve more investment.\nTry, for example, buying ads on Google and find out if that channel\u2019s return on investment is profitable for your business.\nThe tests should always focus on validating the profitability of that channel and also on discovering what works and what doesn\u2019t, after all, you can have multiple strategies on the same channel. Discovery tests are meant to help you find new strategies for that channel.\nOnce the channel works, it is moved to the center, and you should do optimization testing. For example, if Google ads are working, you can test different ads, different \n, or even different keywords to improve your performance further.\nOptimization tests are focused on \n of that channel. If the channel works, you should always look for new strategies to optimize performance, after all, channels become saturated over time, and you can not be surprised when this happens.\nSo you must always be testing new strategies and channels to ensure that you are in control of your growth.\nTo measure the success of your channels, you need to have the right tools, always collecting data about the users that came from each channel.\nDo not start your experiments without reliable tools like Google Analytics or Mixpanel ready to measure the return of your channel experiments.\nCreate spreadsheets to track your performance by channel, always measuring and documenting your conversion rates from users to customers, the cost of acquiring that channel and the value of the customer throughout their life cycle for your company.\nThis worksheet helps you know if you are going in the right direction and how your channels are performing.\nAlso, you need to have traction goals. A traction goal, for example, would be to reach 1,000 paying users in a given month. All your efforts should be aligned with your traction goal and choosing the right goal is very important.\nIf you pursue new registered users, you will have a completely different result than if your goal is new paying users. Set your goals and focus on the channels that will take you to this goal in the smallest possible way.\nTraction Channels\nIn this list, the authors present the 19 most used channels for startups to reach their customers. Let\u2019s look at them:\nViral marketing consists of growing your user and customer base, encouraging your customers to recommend/invite other customers. In the book, the authors interviewed marketing expert Andrew Chen to find commonly used viral strategies.\nFor him, a startup becomes viral when a user brings at least one more user to use its product. If each user can bring in new users, this creates exponential growth.\nViral growth is hard to become sustainable, but it is the force behind some of the fastest growing companies in history, such as Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp.\nA Public Relations (PR) strategy refers to when the company manages to control the media message about it efficiently and profitably.\nThe goal is to achieve broad media coverage, including newspapers, TV, and magazines, and thus attract new users and customers.\nMany startups start thus, seeking to leave the major channels on their market and thus catch the attention of the audience of that publication.\nTo get the press\u2019s attention, you need to give them a good story, facts that make it worth talking about.\nFor example, reaching a certain number of users or releasing a new version of your product may attract the interest of journalists and thus increase their visibility.\nWhen done in an unconventional way, a PR strategy can produce even greater results. Do you know when Red Bull sends a parachute into space?\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. You can do marketing stunts that catch the press\u2019 attention, and this makes the media groups want to talk about you.\nYou can also create viral videos about your product or service, and if you can get people interested in your videos on YouTube, a publication might be interested in talking with you.\nAnother way to use public relations in an unconventional way is by encouraging your clients to talk about you.\nThat can be controlled in a more scalable way, through promotions, challenges, and awards that improve your brand awareness and generate repercussions in the press.\nSEM or Search Engine Marketing relies on paying to advertise on search engines such as Google or Bing and bait clicks from potential users paying for it. PPC (Pay Per Click) ads allow you to reach users while they\u2019re searching for keywords.\nSEM tends to work well for people who sell directly to the end consumer by reaching the customer the moment he seeks solutions.\nWhat\u2019s important is always following the keywords you use, your click-through rate, and the effectiveness of your ads.\nDisplay ads are those banners that you see on the websites you visit on the internet. Social ads already appear on your \n or Twitter timeline, for example.\nWhile search engine PPC ads seek to satisfy an interest the consumer has actively demonstrated through a search, display and social ads seek to generate demand for something customers did not know they needed.\nPeople may not be buying at the moment, but they are always interested in learning new things.\nEven today, companies are investing more in offline marketing than online. And to grow a business, there are dozens of offline channels that can work on acquiring customers.\nTV, radio, newspapers, magazines, outdoor signs, are some of the possible examples. These channels can be used in scale, ranging from local campaigns to reaching an entire country. Few startups use this channel, which can mean less competition to reach these audiences.\nAlmost all internet users go to Google to research their questions. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is about optimizing your site\u2019s pages, so they appear in Google results for these searches.\nWhen a site has pages on your site that take away the user\u2019s doubts, search engines tend to give good positions to these pages in the search, which gain wide exposure for an audience they intend to buy.\nJust like in SEM strategy, these are visitors who are actively seeking solutions to their problems.\nHaving a blog can be a great channel for low-cost acquisition in startups. \n is based on producing relevant content and creating an audience to consume this content. \n allows companies to engage with people, and eventually, these readers end up becoming customers of your company.\nEmail marketing is one of the best tools to convert prospects into customers. Sending an email to your prospects makes them engage directly with your business and read your message.\nEmail is a personal channel and messages from a company appear alongside communications from your friends and family.\nThat is why email marketing is more efficient when it is relevant and personalized.\nYour programming team can help your startup gain traction by creating tools that help you reach more people.\nThese tools can be \n, widgets and educational microsites that put your company in front of more potential customers.\nHubspot, for example, has created a tool that helps people evaluate and find potential problems on their websites. With this, thousands of people use this tool, end up knowing the company and becoming potential clients.\nFocusing on appearing on blogs read by your customers is one of the most common strategies to reach your first customers.\nStartups like the Codecademy, Mint, and Reddit started targeting blogs read by their target audience.\nThe Mint personal finance startup, for example, has focused on niche finance blogs since its inception. By getting these blogs to talk about the company, when they launched the product, tens of thousands of users were already interested in their product.\nBusiness Development (BD) is the process of creating strategic relationships that help the company and its partners grow.\nUnlike sales, when you focus directly on the customer, BD focuses on finding potential partners and joint activities that can benefit both parties.\nIn the process of business development, you need to know how to structure business, find partners and know how to approach them with mastery.\nIn the sales arena, the focus is on creating processes that reach prospects and get them to pay for your product.\nIn many cases, it is necessary to talk and take the potential client\u2019s hand to become a real customer.\nTo scale through sales, you need to know how to create a funnel that generates leads, know how to qualify these leads, and have scalable processes to address and convert them.\nAn affiliate program consists of your company paying other people or companies to sell your product. Companies like \n, Zappos, eBay, Orbitz, and Netflix use affiliate marketing as a scalable revenue-generating channel. Affiliate programs, in general, are a high-performance channel for e-commerce shops and signature clubs.\nExisting platforms are websites, applications or networks with large numbers of users that can be used to generate more traction for your startup. The top examples are the mobile app stores of Apple (Apple Store) and Google (Android Store).\nSocial networks like Facebook and Twitter are also platforms that can be used to find new customers.\nThe effort is based on understanding how these platforms work and how you can convert some of the millions of their users into new customers.\nBeing at a market fair gives you the chance to demonstrate your product in person. Initially, this can be a great channel for generating interest in your product or service.\nAs you grow, these spaces can also be great for announcing new products, features and closing deals with large companies.\nSponsoring or creating offline events can be a strong channel for customer acquisition. These events allow you to interact with customers and talk about their problems.\nThis channel can be especially useful when the company\u2019s customers are not fully connected or engage in online advertising.\nAttracting them to an event, in this case, can be the best way to approach them.\nThis channel works well if you can include an interesting pitch for the people in your talk. If the content takes action, public speaking about your product or service can be a consistent channel to bring new customers to your startup.\nEric Ries, for example, promoted his book \n (check out the microbook here) through lectures and thus managed to get on the bestseller list.\nCreating a community involves generating connections between your customers and bringing more people to talk about your business. Wikipedia, for example, has attracted millions of users by creating a community where people contribute content.\nSo did the startup Stack Exchange, which focused on building a developer community.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cTraction Quotes\u201d\nFinal Notes:\nUnderstanding the marketing channels and having an attack methodology is essential to gaining traction in a startup.\nThis microbook has captured the top 19 customer acquisition channels and brought you a framework called Bullseye to help you prioritize which channels you should choose to grow your business.\nAlways try and find out the best combination for your company."},

And Why?\nIf you\u2019ve already read the two leadership classics, \nand \n\u2013 both co-authored by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin \u2013 you may think that you already know what to expect from \n.\nYet, as we explain below, this book is a bit different; it lacks the usual fair share of war stories and anecdotes, and the structural integrity of the other two books.\nWith that being said, it\u2019s much more motivational and inspirational, much more personal and jam-packed with vigor and get-out-of-your-chair energy.\nYou\u2019ll probably like it if you\u2019re interested in either of these two book categories.\nAbout Jocko Willink\n is a retired United States Navy SEAl commander, a bestselling author on leadership, and a renowned podcaster.\nIn addition to commandeering the most decorated SEAL unit during the Iraq War (SEAL Team Three\u2019s Task Unit Bruiser), Willink is also a graduate from the University of San Diego with a BA in English.\nWith fellow former SEAL Leif Babin, he has authored two incredibly popular books on leadership, \nand \n.\nIn addition, he has also authored four books on his own; \nis one of them.\nHe is also the host of a popular podcast, the \n.\n\u201cDiscipline Equals Freedom PDF Summary\u201d\nWhen compared to the other two works by Jocko Willink we\u2019ve summarized here (\nand \n),\nis rather unusual in at least a few ways:\n\u2022 Jocko Willink is the sole author, aka it\u2019s not co-written with Leif Babin;\n\u2022 It has unusual dimensions for a self-help book (7.7 x 1 x 8.8 inches) and a pretty much distinctive military-feel design;\n\u2022 It\u2019s filled with images of Jocko and stuff, and everything\u2019s even more intimidating and motivating than you\u2019d expect it to be because the entire book is in black and white;\n\u2022 It\u2019s not as tightly structured as \n and \n.\nMore specifically, \nis actually divided into two parts \u2013 \u201cThoughts\u201d and \u201cActions\u201d \u2013 with the latter part subdivided into three sections: \u201cFuel: Feeding the Machine,\u201d \u201cRepair and Maintenance: Injury Prevention and Recovery,\u201d and \u201cAppendix: The Workouts.\u201d\nFurthermore \u2013 and as already suggested \u2013 the lessons come in distinctive tiny dosages, bursting with energy via short, powerful sentences and bolded, all-capped crescendos scattered all around the page.\nWillink covers many topics throughout the book, mostly from a theoretical standpoint in its first part (topics here include discipline, fear, procrastination, weakness, regret, etc.) and in a much more practical manner in the second part (diet, sleep, working out, etc.).\nSince even listing all of the lessons inside would take us too much space, for our summary, we decided to select and digest only the best bits of the book.\nAnd since the second part is much more practical (it even includes \u201cthe workouts\u201d), we\u2019ve relied almost exclusively on the first one.\nKey Lessons from \u201cDiscipline Equals Freedom\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Way of Discipline\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where Does Discipline Come From?\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Overcoming Procrastination: When and Where to Start?\n4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Staying Motivated. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n5. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sugarcoated Lies\n6. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Me Versus Me\n7. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Laughter Wins\nThe Way of Discipline\nThis is, by far, the most important lesson of the book: there\u2019s nothing without self-control, and the only way is the way of the discipline.\nIf you\u2019ve come him looking for the shortcut or the hack \u2013 Jocko Willink is pretty adamant about this \u2013 you will never find it.\nWhy?\nWell, because:\nWillink describes discipline as \u201cthe root of all good qualities,\u201d \u201cthe driver of daily execution\u201d and \u201cthe core principle that overcomes laziness and lethargy and excuses.\u201d\nIt\u2019s pretty simple when you think about it!\nWant to become a good guitarist? You need to have the discipline to practice. \nWant to become a great footballer? Once again, unless you\u2019re in a cartoon, you won\u2019t achieve that through some magical transformation, but \n.\nWant to earn some money and become rich? You need \n; as a rule of thumb, if someone\u2019s selling you shortcuts, he\u2019s 100% lying to you.\nWhere Does Discipline Come From?\nAccording to Jocko Willink, the question from the title has a pretty simple answer: \u201cDiscipline comes from within. Discipline is an internal force.\u201d\nWhat about \n and self-help gurus and drill instructors, you say?\nSure, they can help you, notes Willink. But unless they are there with you all the time under all circumstances, it will be only a temporary solution.\nExternal discipline is neither as strong nor as permanent as self-discipline.\nAnd self-discipline, as the term itself implies, comes from you, comes from the Self.\nMore specifically, it comes from your decision to make a mark on the world, to do more, to \nmore.\nSelf-discipline lurks behind every single one of your choices, be they as banal as should you eat this apple or this chocolate bar.\nIf you repeatedly choose the latter, then blame nobody for your failures: you are not disciplined enough.\nOvercoming Procrastination: When and Where to Start?\nUnless you\u2019re a superhero, you know exactly how procrastination work: instead of preparing for your math exam tomorrow, here you are, reading a summary of a book you didn\u2019t know if it existed until yesterday.\nAnd this is not just a one-off event: it\u2019s something that keeps happening to you over and over again.\nSo, how do you stop it? When is the best time to stop procrastinating?\nHere and Now, says Jocko Willink.\nSimply put, that\u2019s the reality of it all: books don\u2019t get written by themselves; ideas don\u2019t get executed through some miraculous force in the universe; and weights aren\u2019t going to move a single inch unless you try lifting them.\nIt\u2019s not that complicated, so, really, there\u2019s no need for you to go on researching or debating the pros and cons of it.\nJust start doing this.\nTake the first step and make things happen.\nHere and Now.\nStaying Motivated\nMotivation is a powerful force. \nSo powerful, in fact, that sometimes it can help you move mountains.\nEmphasis on \n.\nIt\u2019s a myth that motivation is a spark; \n; and is the pretty legitimate child of discipline, progress, and success.\nDon\u2019t believe us?\nBelieve Jocko Willink!\nHe\u2019s a Navy SEAL who has spent years of his life fighting to survive (literally), and yet he says that you can\u2019t \u201cexpect to be motivated every day to get out there and make things happen.\u201d \nThe reality is that you won\u2019t be. \nSo, once again, it\u2019s wrong to count on motivation to achieve something.\nYou need to count on Discipline.\nThere are no magic pills or life hacks known to men that will ever do the job for you; you have to do the work yourself; you are the one who has to make it happen.\nSugarcoated Lies\nDonuts are tempting.\nGod-I\u2019d-give-everything-for-one-at-this-moment tempting.\nThe colorful sprinkles, the cream filling, the glaze\u2026 \nWe know what you must be thinking at the moment: why are you doing this to me, man? I need to get a donut right away!\nWhy shouldn\u2019t you?\nIt\u2019s just one treat for the day, and, dare we say, its highlight! And, moreover, you\u2019re hungry. And when you\u2019re hungry, any food is better than no food, right?\nWrong. Dead wrong.\nFirst of all, donuts \u2013 just like chocolate chip cookies, double Dutch chocolate cake, Coca Cola, potato chips, pretzels, hot dogs \u2013 are, simply put, \nfood!\nThey are, quite literally, \n.\nThey don\u2019t make you better, stronger, faster, healthier, smarter \u2013 they make you the very opposite of this.\nEven when you\u2019re hungry.\nAnd, believe us, you\u2019ve never been hungry; human beings can survive for a month without food, and you\u2019ve barely gone without it for more than 10 hours.\nDonuts are enticing because they are sugarcoated lies.\nThere will be many other sugarcoated lies you\u2019ll happen upon throughout your life, both literal, and, much more importantly, metaphorical.\nStay. Away. From. Them.\nIf they are shiny, sweet, tempting, and, especially, if they are free \u2013 then they are most probably lies, poisonous lies!\nDon\u2019t let them fool you.\nJust stay on your course: your will is much stronger than the will of a donut.\nHold the line.\nMe Versus Me\n\u201cThere are people in the world who have skills and strength and talent that I will never have. Never.\u201d\nFor example, he says, no matter how much he trains and how hard he works, he will never be an Olympic weightlifter or an Olympic sprinter.\nAnd this comes from a guy who\u2019s a decorated Navy SEAL commander and who has probably trained every single day of his adult life for at least a few hours!\nNow, why\u2019s that?\nBecause he doesn\u2019t have \u201cthe right genes.\u201d \n.\nBut where does that leave us, we who are tenth the people Jocko Willink is?\nWell, in his opinion, precisely where he was a few decades ago: resolute to try to become what his genes say that he will never be.\nBecause, in the end, that amounts to becoming the best that he can be.\n\u201cMy glory,\u201d notes Willink in few sentences which are more than worthy of a quote: \nYou always win today if you\u2019re better than you were yesterday.\nAnd that\u2019s guaranteed.\nLaughter Wins\n\u201cSure, there\u2019s darkness everywhere,\u201d notes Jocko Willink in his last \u201cthought.\u201d \u201cAnd I have seen my share.\u201d\nRemember (once again): this is a guy who has not only fought but commandeered during the bloodiest battle of the Iraq War, a man who has seen other people \u2013 his friends and soldiers \u2013 die at his feet.\nIn other words, he has seen so much more darkness than you will ever see. \nEven so, he really thinks that despairing over it all is the wrong way to go.\nNo matter how difficult life is, it is less so when you\u2019re laughing at it.\nSo:\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cDiscipline Equals Freedom Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nis not much different from \n; in some ways, it could even remind one of Tony Robbins.\nHowever, make no mistakes: this book\u2019s a bit different than all those \u201cyou can achieve everything you want to\u201d manuals.\nBecause it starts where all self-help books should start from: the \u201cno shortcuts\u201d reality of life. \nIt offers no secrets, no hacks, no tricks.\nJust a bunch of sensible, commonsense, practical pieces of advice you can\u2019t go wrong with."},

And Why?\nTruthfully, we all have dreams that are abandoned and are getting dusty in the corner. We reckon that to achieve them, we have to do so much that the prize isn\u2019t even worth the effort. \nJack argues otherwise. \nIn \u201c\n\u201d you\u2019ll get a clue on how to get the most out of life while trying the least. Therefore, we believe that it is a great fit for everyone.\nAbout Jack Canfield\n is a renowned American corporate trainer, author, and a motivational speaker. \nOver the years, he became known as one of the most influential individuals with regards to motivation and ambition.\nAmong other things, he also wrote the following books:\n\u201cSuccess Affirmations PDF Summary\u201d\n: \nFinding positivity from within will invigorate your life. Allocate a couple of minutes right after you wake up, to send these affirmations back to the Universe. Do it again before bedtime and reap the benefits as you move.\n: \nYour life doesn\u2019t resemble anyone else\u2019s. Put down on a piece of paper two of your unique personal skills and explain why do you enjoy expressing those qualities.\nIn the end, make a statement.\n: \nHow would you describe success?\nMake an \u201cI want\u201d list, and outline everything that makes you feel happy while doing it. Find a peaceful place and try to be as specific as possible.\n: \nPeople are taught to behave along the lines of expectancy. If you have negative experience about doing something, you\u2019ll likely be hesitant to try it one more time.\nTwo things stopping you from experiencing prosperity: The fear of the unknown, and your knowledge. \n: \nYour brain is not designed to be stuck in the mediocre middle; tilted in neither way. It\u2019s made to achieve goals, and solve problems. \nEradicate terms like: I can\u2019t, it\u2019s too hard, in order to make that a living reality.\n: \nPositive mindset = Positive outcome. I mean, let\u2019s be realistic here \u2013 Have you ever seen a depressed person enjoy life? \u2013 No, because when you radiate negativity, you get what you pay for. \nThe same applies the other way around.\n: \nBe clear about your goals, because otherwise, you can\u2019t accomplish them. Visualize the life upon achieving those objectives, and understand the big picture.\nPrior to that, make sure that you set the right goals.\n: \nThis process is pretty self-explanatory. It\u2019s in your best interest to break down the large goals into smaller ones in order to improve your execution. \nPlan your day the night before, and allow your mind to really work out the details.\n: \nSuccess is by no means random. People with high-energy are always on full alert when someone else is speaking about their goals, and they try to absorb as much as information as possible.\nOn top of that, to achieve extraordinary results, you need to take action.\n: \nReleasing the brakes refers to the temerity to let go of meaningless concepts. The limited mindset is one of the biggest obstacles on your path to prosperity. \nWork on expanding your comfort zone, day in and day out.\n: \nSee it, to achieve it. Imagination is more powerful than knowledge, and that has been proven over and over again. \nBefore hitting the rack, read your list of goals, and try to visualize your success in reaching them. \n: \nAct as if nothing can stop you. If we conflate belief with action, we get that winning mentality. So much about victimhood, as we transform our mindset by being self-confident and eager to succeed.\n: \nYou don\u2019t need to lay down a comprehensive blueprint \u2013 just take the first step! Mistakes should not be construed as unwanted experiences but as much-needed lessons.\nEmbrace feedback, and hustle!\n: \nAs you accept unlimited liability for your life, you are not ignorant of the fact that you might end up someplace better. \nWhere you want to go, it is not always the best place you can be. \n: \nDon\u2019t let fear stand in the way of action. Fear is just a form of inner resistance, nothing to get particularly upset about. \nReplace those tendencies with images of positive affirmation.\n: \nAre you? Well, not many people are, but if you can\u2019t pay the price, and you can\u2019t carry the burden, you don\u2019t deserve success.\nDelve yourself into the richness of life, and utilize every available ounce of strength to see it through.\n: \nIf you are asking to get a \u201cNo,\u201d then you better keep quiet. If you stop asking questions, you\u2019ll be dragged into misery.\nAsk until you get a \u201cYes.\u201d\n: \nRejection is nothing but a form of encouragement. Asking with confidence transforms even the bitterest rejection into a profound experience.\n: \nWhat\u2019s your attitude toward feedback? \nIf you are keen to move forward and paddle your way to the top, then you must apply the valuable feedback delivered at your doorsteps.\n: \nNothing can stop me as long as I am working harder than everyone else! \nYou are getting better by the day because the big tasks are chunked down into digestible assignments.\n: \nIf you lean on gut instinct to get an \n, you\u2019ll soon realize the mistake. \nKeep score of your progress, define KPIs, track these metrics, and you\u2019ll get to the bottom of every problem.\n: \nThere\u2019s no such thing as \u2013 Recline in your chair, and everything that is yours will come to you. \nAlways be on the lookout for better ways to improve your position, and find alternative routes that can lead you to success.\n: \nThe rule of 5 evinces the excitement of \n.\nJack underlines five specific actions that ought to be executed in the following day, as a method of getting closer to his goals.\n: \nStand out from the rest, by over-delivering on your promises, and exceeding your personal expectations.\nIt all boils down to the idea of putting a little bit of extra effort each day.\n: \nThe old adage is true \u2013 your circle of friends defines who you are. \nIf you are surrounded by goal-oriented individuals, that\u2019s exactly what will give you the impetus to push forward.\n: \nEncourage your \n to achieve greater goals by praising the smaller ones. \nYou have to be proud and feel elevated whenever you achieve a goal, regardless of its magnitude.\n: \nKeep your eyes on the mark?\nBring more focus to each task, until you can truly say that you are living in the moment.\n: \nWhen will the good things come to pass?\nRight about the time you clean up the mess that is going on in your head. \n: \nIf you can\u2019t make peace with your past, you will be unable to see the good side of the future.\nBy handling the painful memories, you are creating the future you\u2019d like to live in. \n: \nIf something isn\u2019t working, you have to pluck up your courage and find the remedy.\nYou cannot improve your life if you are unwilling to take risks and work your way through tough situations.\n: \nAllow those thoughts into your mind that resonate with the person you\u2019d like to become.\nYour mind can be either your best friend or your worst enemy. It\u2019s up to you!\n: \n that occurs after repeatedly doing something.\nIf your mind becomes accustomed to things that predict success, then you\u2019re on the right track. \n: \nAre you giving 100% when carrying out the daily assignments or are you more into procrastination?\nBe honest with yourself, and practice the \u201cno exceptions\u201d rule to get everything done. \n: \nAre you committed to lifelong learning? \nThe people who are can be counted on one\u2019s fingers!\n: \nYou cannot be a failure if you are following your passion and allowing that eagerness to sustain you.\nEnthusiasm and determination when weaved together, represent the most powerful engine for achieving your goals.\n: \nBe smart with regards to the delegation of tasks. \nFocus on the core, and let others do the trivial things. \n: \nBalance out the time spent on work, family, relationships, etc.\nManagement of time is slowly turning into the biggest issue of the modern age.\n: \nWell, this is the hard part. \nThere are literally thousands of minor distractions that are stealing our time. It\u2019s time we say \u201cNo\u201d to them!\n: \nDo you want to be a leader? Then, present yourself as a person of ideas, and as an individual who has a lot to offer.\nSome say that there\u2019s a genetic factor in being a leader, but that\u2019s just utter nonsense.\n: \nNo one knows everything. \nIf you create a valuable network of achievers, you\u2019ll be compelled to push forward and influence others to do likewise.\n: \nThere\u2019s some magic in aligning with a group of likely-thinkers. \nThen you can work as a team in extracting energy and power from above.\n: \nAre you ready to connect with the higher-sense of self through meditation, discipline and inner guidance?\nIf you become spiritually attuned, you\u2019ll much more easily spot opportunities and ward off enemies.\n: \nIt\u2019s needless to say that the elements of productive intercourse are rooted in active listening.\nTry not to judge while doing it, and remain neutral. \n: \nAre you ready to take the next step in the conversation?\nJack believes that \u201cHeart Talk\u201d or freely expressing your feelings has a crucial role in that matter.\n: \nSome say that radical truth is better than pleasant lies. And we cannot agree more!\nBring up the critical issues, call out the instigators and deal with the predicament as quickly as possible.\n: \nYou are in control of the words you utter, so use them with caution.\nOn top of that, impeccability is just the path leading to abundance and prosperity.\n: \nBear in mind that lavishing praise upon someone is an act to be admired.\nLearn to appreciate the efforts of others, and give them the respect they deserve.\n: \nElegance, as a feature can surely give you a boost in this world of ours.\nAct with class, show dignity and respect when dealing with people. Become a role model by blazing a trail for others to follow.\n: \nDon\u2019t squander the money on meaningless pleasures. \nMake positive choices about what to do with the money you earn.\n: \nTry to find out what lies at the bottom of your heart.\nFocus on acquiring wealth if that\u2019s your priority, and make sure that you have enough resources to fund your future lifestyle.\n: \nDo you dream about being debt-free?\nDon\u2019t ever stop thinking about new ways to make money, and refrain yourself from spending money you didn\u2019t earn.\n: \nEvery dollar you make is an opportunity for you as much as it is for the rest of the world to live in peace.\nJack argues that tithing a portion of the money you\u2019ve earned to those in need will help you to feel even better.\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free \n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cSuccess Affirmations Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nWe hope that you learned something today because we sure did!\nDo you feel ready and eager to test the 52-week transition?\nIt\u2019s not going to be a piece of cake, but it sure is an endeavor worth testing."},

And Why?\nDespite the false information swarming the media that introverts are the minority in Western countries, Laurie managed to unearth the real story.\nAccording to a lot of research and statistics, introverts make up more than half of the population, and they are most-definitely misrepresented. \nSo, this social bias that occurs must be put under scrutiny, for us to understand why are we treating them as underdogs.\nWith that said, we believe that \u201c\n\u201d is empowering to those who feel like the system is rigged toward them. \nHowever, we don\u2019t believe that playing the victim card would do you any good!\nAbout Laurie Helgoe\n is an American psychologist personal development coach and an author. \nShe was praised and awarded by Publishers Weekly for debunking the myth of introversion and extroversion.\nLaurie has also appeared on several TV & Radio Shows.\n\u201cIntrovert Power PDF Summary\u201d\nMany people struggle to blend into society, especially when their form of expression is not in line with the curve of the culture.\nAmerica, for example, is probably the world\u2019s richest country in terms of diversity, freedom, opportunities, etc. But is the US shifting its culture with regards to competition, and more importantly attitude?\nProbably not, but introversion is no longer taboo, and is no longer regarded as a secondary phenomenon. \nWell, when you dragged into this combative workforce, introverts do feel threatened and uncomfortable.\nWhen introverts sense that someone is trying to break their defensive perimeter, they have three options:\nThe Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is embedded in the research methodology that covers the effects of introversion and extroversion. \nThe most misleading aspect incorporated in this research was the idea that Introverts make up the minority of modern \n. Approximately, every 1 in 4 is considered to be an Introvert, and another misconception that floats around is that: Introverts are quiet, scared and unwilling to take chances. \nFrom an early age, we receive schooling regarding social norms, and how to behave. \nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we are compelled to act in a given manner, but more so to capitalize on the extrovert traits.\nSo, what\u2019s the main issue related to introversion?\nThey are not so easily understood since they hide most of the stuff inside, and have no urge to show off in front of other people.\nAccording to Laurie, one of the biggest misconceptions regarding introverts is the one that they are anti-social. \nIn comparison to extroverts who look for answers on the outside, introverts tend to care about human condition, but inwardly.\nFor instance, traits that describe a sociopath are not anger and bitterness, but charm showcased outwardly. However, they feel no sympathy toward their intended victims, so it\u2019s more than evident that categorizing introverts as anti-social is utterly preposterous.\nAfter a long and exhausting week, you can finally take some time off on a cold Friday night. You decide to go to the bookstore, pick an exciting novel, recline on the sofa, curl up, enjoy your time and recharge your batteries. \nBut on the way there, you bump into a friend who invites you to a party.\nYour facial expression reveals that you are not up for the offer, but out of fear of judgment, you accept. Once there, you begin to question your decision and feel how everyone is validating your choice except you. You dread being labeled as some anti-social type of person, even at the expense of your own preferences.\nAssociation is productive, no matter what, they say.\nYou would much rather have a thoughtful conversion about a book that you\u2019ve read, or just sit in silence contemplating about life. \nHowever, this choice is not well-received by society. \nLaurie puts it perfectly by stating that: \nAnd there\u2019s no difference between the sexes, the same is true.\nHow would you interpret this situation? As a display of loneliness or solitude?\nWhen it comes to friends, we are often told: The more, the better.\nSolitude is regarded as a \n. Throughout life, you are encouraged to hang out with people, to expand your network, to nurture family values, to abide by these norms, and never ever deviate from this pathway.\nWell, that\u2019s not even kind of close.\nLet us expand on why solitude is, by all means, a mystery and a problem to society!\nIn a competitive culture and workforce, your main asset is knowing what the competition is planning. But how can you come out a winner if your competitors don\u2019t allow you in? \nYou would have to make assumptions without any information to \n. \nNow, you can begin to understand why solitude is a great source of power and a pain in the ass to those who want to dominate you.\nYou can hear it on the news when introverts commit serious crimes and get a lot of public attention. This backlash is later used to demonize introverts and denigrate their self-expression.\nHowever, they fail to mention that perpetrators and sociopaths are externally oriented. They see destruction as a way of dealing with their inner chaos for which they cannot find an antidote.\nIt stands to reason why most introverts are perceived as aliens; unhinged individuals \u2013 walking on eggshells.\nBut that\u2019s not true!\nIf you look at sci-fiction movies, aliens are often associated with intruders or unwanted visitors.\nSo, the only thing an introvert can do is choose between:\n\u2013 Staying faithful to yourself, and risk being labeled or discarded by society\n\u2013 Adapt to the social norms, and fall victim to the self-alienation\nWhich one is the lesser evil?\nThe strange thing is, more than half of the population are introverts. And people act with disbelief when they hear this.\nInasmuch as we all like to live in one society, and garner the support from our community, it\u2019s hard to maintain a homogeneous mindset.\nAnd we all know that there\u2019s nothing more frightful than an independent thinker.\nCase in point, the Russian Revolution. \nAnd, in the aftermath of the revolution, people witnessed the horrors of the thought that drove their utterances.\nIntroverts want leeway to make up their own minds, but they often fell into disfavor which further crumbles their outward appearance.\nThey are not prompted but forced to act in a way that is deemed suitable by the so-called majority, which is utter nonsense.\nThe paradox is presented as a clash between the desire and death model.\nDesire or urge, when appropriately initiated, can\u2019t be stopped, and it propels itself. \nThe holding capacity or the ability to withstand pressure and still work your way through life is the epitome of introversion.\nSo, what\u2019s the step-by-step process, let\u2019s dig in:\nIt may not come as a shock to you, but introverts are much more in tune with the intrinsic qualities of oneself.\nAnd yes, if you are an introvert, you have the right to back down and not follow the norms imposed upon you. Escaping can be difficult, but it\u2019s also expedient, and you\u2019ll rarely have other option to maintain your comfort.\nAccording to the desire-based model, there are several questions worth answering:\nIt may seem strange, but introverts do find a lot of support in being around animals and enjoying nature. Sometimes, it is for the better to avoid human interactions altogether, for the sake of preserving your inner peace.\nThey won\u2019t start off a conversation with some meaningless pickup line, or simply to fill in the void. They would much rather be engrossed in a dialogue by sharing something meaningful that could actually make a difference.\nIf you tone it down, you might listen to what introverts are saying, even when their lips are not moving. \nAnn Landers makes a point by saying the following thing:\nAnd yes, many people feel reluctant to avow their anti-party sentiment, mostly out of fear. \nIn all honesty, it\u2019s hard for some extroverts to understand how overwhelming a party can be to introverts. If you recall similar situations, you know how hard you\u2019ve tried to make them stay a bit longer, but you weren\u2019t able to make them love the noisy gathering.\nAs an introvert, you should learn to say \u201cNo,\u201d and stand your ground.\nSome introverts have a hard time working with many people and being deprived of \n. Then again, you can\u2019t control the company\u2019s policies, but being a part of an environment that is too clamorous can impede your creativity and make you less productive.\nWith that said, the corporate environment is rarely if ever, adjusted to them.\nAnd most importantly, introverts always blame themselves and internalize their problems. \nKey Lessons from \u201cIntrovert Power\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Get right into the fight\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don\u2019t follow the self-alienation mentality\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Capitalize on introversion\nGet right into the fight\nWell, we are not advising you to throw fists at people for not understanding your position. \nWe are merely implying that you don\u2019t have to subdue your basic instincts in order to fit into a certain community.\nGet into the right shape of mind and fight to preserve your peace.\nDon\u2019t follow the self-alienation mentality\nWhat do we mean by that?\nIf at some point, you decide to throw away your desires, and simply adapt to the environment, you\u2019ll only activate the self-alienation process.\nIt doesn\u2019t work to your benefit and only makes you miserable.\nCapitalize on introversion\nDespite what society says \u2013 introverts are immensely creative. \nDon\u2019t squander this opportunity by feeling guilty for your desire to remain in solitude. \nFollow your passion, and if something doesn\u2019t work for you, just abandon it!\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free \n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cIntrovert Power Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nWe are glad that now you can hear the other side of the story.\nIntroverts had a tough time with regards to socialization and acceptance, not because extroverts did something to them, but because we as a society failed to understand their perspective.\nFor precisely that reason, we reckon that this book is very enlightening."},

If I\u2019m calm, the people I talk to will probably reply in a similar manner. This is due to the fact that our surroundings reflect our personality.\nIf we\u2019re not fond of cleanliness, our room might be messy. Similarly, we tend to wait for instructions in every part of our lives.\nMaybe it\u2019s because great theories lead our practical lives. And who wouldn\u2019t want to live a perfect life?\nDefining ourselves is in our very nature: my name is; I live here; I have green eyes; I\u2019m short; I\u2019m a dreamy person, or maybe down-to-earth. This leads us to an author named Akash Karia.\nAbout\u00a0Akash Karia\n is an award-winning speaker and peak performance coach. He currently lives in Tanzania, where he works as the Chief Commercial Officer of a multi-million dollar company.\n\u201cHabits for Life PDF Summary\u201d\nHe regularly conducts keynotes, workshops, and seminars. His fans say he\u2019s a phenomenal coach, and the knowledge gained from him is priceless.\nI believe Karia is one of the few authors who try to highlight that we ourselves are not the problem. The great problem consists in our surroundings, generated by the lack of good instructions.\nAkash Karia hints at our individual footprints; our steps create paths. That\u2019s why his book is entitled \n It can be read as an instruction manual. He believes that our habits determine our surroundings.\nis a guidebook for creating order in our chaotic\u00a0world, a world in which global communications can damage our self-images.\nKaria\u2019s main concept relies on two different branches: the small habit and the keystone habit.\nSmall habits are those which are so small that very little willpower is required to carry them out. Keystone habits, on the other hand, are the habits that set off a chain reaction of new and improved behaviors in other unrelated areas. These two habits create an equation like this:\nSmall Habits + Keystone Habits = Big Results.\nAkash Karia gives tips for habits: read for 10 minutes; do two push-ups; drink a small glass of water with lunch; stretch for one minute; write 25 words in your journal; sit down at a piano; do one yoga pose; floss one tooth; laugh out loud once. These actions force you to do something and to do something regularly.\nIf you plan, you can then carry it out. \n, you should reward yourself. If you lose, you should learn from it. A small habit could be putting on your running shoes. You\u2019ve already won, whether you actually go for a run or not.\nIf you apply this small habit regularly, it\u2019s more likely to start a chain of habits \u2013 a keystone habit.\nThere\u2019s a vital concept of planning, called the \u201cif-then goals\u201d. It increases the chances of success. The main idea is to focus on the positive and take some time to plan ahead.\nIt\u2019s also about \u201cmental contrasting\u201d.

Our personal GPS could be a close friend. According to Karia, it\u2019s important to have the added perspective of someone who can motivate you, and who understands the importance of consistency.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s best to choose someone whose characteristics you wish to emulate. The friend who lives off pizza and fried chicken probably won\u2019t be the one encouraging you to stick with your plate of steamed vegetables.\nIf you can\u2019t find a friend to motivate you, turn to your second best friend \u2013 the Internet. Writing down your goals and achievements is a successful strategy: blog it, Tweet it, put it on Facebook.

That book convinced him to switch careers from cartoonist to public speaker, marketing specialist, and author.\nBRAINY BUSINESS / THE BRAIN AUDIT\n\u00a0starts off with a revolutionary idea: \u201cThe brain works just like a \n\u201d. And that conveyor belt is waiting for 7 \u201cbags\u201d, or ideas, in order to complete the sale.\n\u201cThe Brain Audit PDF Summary\u201d\nAccording to Sean D\u2019Souza, to gain the perfect score in a sale you have to be able to interest your client in your products. At the same time, you have to keep them curious and eager to find out more.\nAnd you can do that by creating a\u00a0\u201c\n\u201d. The seller has to create a sense of security within the client, easily done through well-planned testimonials specifically selected to defuse objections.\nLet\u2019s go back a little to the \n. These \u201cbags\u201d must be followed, developed and respected in this exact order to achieve your expected result. According to \nthe 7 bags are:\nWhen reading \n, you\u2019ll learn how to follow and exploit each bag. You\u2019ll also learn the motivation behind searching the bags in this exact order, from small to big, from problem to complete closure.\nIn the \u201cProblem chapter,\u201d you\u2019re presented with the idea that our brains calculate every possible outcome of a certain decision in order to keep us alive. That is why\nIn order to light up the brain, you have to feed it the information it\u2019s trained to notice if it wants to keep you safe.\nHere comes the revolutionary idea: despite the fact that most courses and books tell you to highlight the benefits of a product, Sean D\u2019Souza teaches you to underline the PROBLEM, because, after all, benefits are merely solutions.\nHe provides an excellent example to explain this: a computer problem you didn\u2019t know you had\u00a0until you\u2019re presented with a solution that fixes it\u00a0\u2013 a slow computer that may present signs of an imminent hard disk crash.\nThis example can go even further if you think about the fact that we wouldn\u2019t\u00a0need cell phones if we didn\u2019t know they existed.\nD\u2019Souza even analyzes the fact that problems presented first don\u2019t scare the customer because the problem already exists. All you have to do is enhance it in order to highlight a solution to it and future problems that can develop from this initial problem.\nTaking this into consideration, we have to isolate a problem if we want to get the message out effectively.\nLater in the book, during the \u201cSolution\u201d chapter, you encounter the idea that providing a solution only works if the customer is first presented with a problem. We\u2019re hard-wired to concentrate on the benefits and features, and this will engage your customer.\nOur brains respond better to problems simply because this is the natural sequence: first we see the problem, and then the solution. That\u2019s why D\u2019Souza believes \u201call the solution should do is flip the problem around\u201d, leading to chapter 3 \u2013 Target Profile.\nEvery one of us is different, and we love to believe that we\u2019re unique and special.\nWhen a seller creates a product that targets a certain profile, he includes a lot of people who\u00a0identify with that specific profile.\nThe perfect example is that of Anita Roddick, the founder of The Body Shop \u2013 a beauty chain that stands out in a market where \u201cbeauty products are a dime a dozen\u201d \u2013 who found success by appealing to a profile and not a demographic.\nA handy tip presented in \n\u00a0is the steps to follow in order to create a profile. They are: start with a demographic; choose a real person from that demographic; speak to that person and find out their list of problems regarding your product or service; pick one problem and expand it; and, last but not least, use a real person for feedback.\nAfter you\u2019ve listened to\u00a0your target audience feedback, reproduce what you understood from it; in other words \u2013 \n to make sure that you\u2019ve understood what you\u2019ve heard.\nThis book summary will clear the path to a new scientific discovery \u2013 you probably receive many messages on a daily basis, but the attention and energy are pointed only to those that matter to you. Follow Sean D\u2019souza tips and make your life easier.\nAnd with this in mind, D\u2019Souza glides into the next chapter \u2013 The Trigger. The message that grabs our attention, the one that gives us no option but to respond predictably.\nFaced with the problem, solution, and target together, you\u2019re likely to get the trigger if you use the information correctly.\n\u2019s book summary indicates that any message starts with the problem. The problem gets the customer\u2019s attention. Then the solution kicks in \u2013 The Brain Audit.\nTo keep the client\u2019s attention, you have to bring up more detailed information about the problem. That gets the customer\u2019s attention all over again.\nWe seem to have about 6 or 7 main objections for \n \u2013 creating a \u201cbag\u201d. When this bag appears, the Objection bag, the customer is more likely to purchase your product regardless of any obstacle.\nAs D\u2019Souza says in a footnote, during his presentations he only explains the first 3 bags but is always asked for the entire list. So far we\u2019ve reached bag number 4, objections \u2013 the first 3 being a problem, solution, and target and the adjoining trigger.\nThe final 3 bags play an equally relevant part in \n: testimonials, risk reversal, and uniqueness.\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free\u00a0\n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks."},

A pioneering researcher in cardiology, Gundry invented a few devices that reverse the cell death in heart attacks and was featured in a story by \nmagazine in 1990.\nAfter completing a fellowship in congenital heart surgery at the Hospital for Sick Children, and two years as a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Gundry was recruited as professor and chairman of cardiothoracic surgery at Loma Linda University School of Medicine, a Seventh-day Adventist health sciences university.\nIn 2000, after supposedly curing an \u201cinoperable\u201d patient via a combination of nutraceutical supplements and dietary changes, Gundry left Loma Linda University and established the International Heart and Lung Institute in California, where he currently devotes his time to researching the possibilities for \u201cdietary and nutraceutical reversal of most diseases.\u201d\nHe has published several books on the topic, including \nand \n.\nFind out more at \n \u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThe Plant Paradox PDF Summary\u201d\n\u201cSuppose that in the next few pages I told you that everything you thought you knew about your diet, your health, and your weight is wrong\u201d \u2013 writes Steven Gundry in the very first sentence of \n.\nHis point?\nIf you\u2019re overweight and unhealthy even though you\u2019ve tried every single diet (low-carb, low-fat, paleo, low-glycemic) and every single exercise regime (running, speed walking, weight training, aerobics, CrossFit, yoga, core training, spinning, high-intensity interval training), then could it be that the problem is not with you, but with the diets and the regimes?\n\u201cYour health problems are not your fault,\u201d states Gundry explicitly before confidently pointing out that his book intends to change all of that:\nAnd so are we \u2013 so let\u2019s walk you through Gundry\u2019s arguments and findings.\nThe Attack of the Lectins\n. \nConsequently, if you are as small as a mosquito or as slow as a sloth, you better have another defense mechanism at your disposal, for unless you are capable of biting or your flesh has an awful taste, then evolution is not exactly going to be your best friend.\nBut where does this leave plants then?\nApparently, they are no different \u2013 they too have defense mechanisms, even the most innocuous among them; in other words, a plant doesn\u2019t need to be poisonous for you to think that it is unwilling to be eaten by you.\nNow, the most common defense mechanism in plants is a group of complex proteins called lectins; you can find them in the grains, skins, seeds, and leaves of most plants.\nWhat they do is, when you consume a plant which contains them, they bind to the sugar molecules in your brain and nerve endings causing something known as \u201cbrain fog.\u201d \nYou know what we\u2019re talking about: it\u2019s when you get all drowsy, have trouble focusing and experience memory difficulties.\nAdditionally, some of these lectins also result in you gaining some weight:\nWe\u2019ve told you before: \n.\nBut there\u2019s more to it.\nThe Microbes in Your Belly\n: about 90% of the cells in your body are non-human microbes, most of which you need to survive because they are the ones which convert the food you eat into energy.\nAnd most of these microbes are imprisoned in your belly; if some of them leave your intestinal tract, then you\u2019re in for a serious problem: your body treats these microbes as imposters, and your immune system suddenly goes haywire.\nSo, you have a proper Civil War inside your own body: some cells are attacking other cells even though, in essence, they are on the same team.\nAnd this is what we call an autoimmune disease.\nHow is this important in relation to the lectins mentioned above?\nWell, we\u2019ve recently discovered that lectins increase the permeability of your intestines, allowing the microbes to leave your belly and move into unknown territory.\nSo, in a way, many of your autoimmune diseases may appear because you eat wheat and some other plants.\n?\nNot so much: it is exactly because of the lectins in the bran that your body attacks itself.\nBaguettes, ciabattas, white rice \u2013 they are all bran-free.\nAnd there\u2019s a reason why they are the staples of some of the healthiest cuisines of the world: French, Italian, and Asian.\nThe Four Rules of the Plant Paradox Program\nAccording to Steven Gundry, \u201cthese four simple rules will enable you to experience success on the Plant Paradox Program.\u201d\nThe Plant Paradox Program is more about the things you shouldn\u2019t eat than it is about the things you should. \nThis should, after all, be as obvious as a platitude: you help your health much more if you say \u201cno\u201d to one bad thing than if you say \u201cyes\u201d to ten good and still consume that bad thing.\nThis rule sounds even better when told in laymen\u2019s terms: \u201cgive your gut bugs what they want, and nobody gets hurt.\u201d\nAnd when we mean your gut bugs \u2013 we do mean your good gut bugs; unfortunately, your bad dietary habits and all those antibiotics you\u2019ve used in the past few decades have all but decimated them by now; the bad ones may be the majority there, in your gut.\nSo, stop feeding them junk food (sugar, refined carbs, and saturated fat); they\u2019ll have to leave and make room for the return of your friends, the good gut bugs.\nAccording to Steven R. Gundry, the difference between a bowl of Skittles and a fruit salad is all but negligible: \u201cit\u2019s the same poisonous stuff,\u201d he says.\nThe only three fruits you can eat \u2013 and, mind you, only when they are green \u2013 are bananas, mangoes, and papayas. \nEvery single other fruit should be off the table.\nAnd if you have doubts over whether something is a fruit or vegetable \u2013 then, rule number 3 has a corollary: \u201cif it has seeds, it\u2019s fruit!\u201d\nIn other words, even though you think you\u2019re eating meat, you are actually also eating corn and soybeans, because that\u2019s what industrially raised food animals are regularly fed with.\nAnd that\u2019s not a good thing.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Plant Paradox\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lectins Are Bad for Your Health \u2013 and They Can Be Found in Healthy Foods\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Four Rules of the Plant Paradox Program\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Plant Paradox Program\nLectins Are Bad for Your Health \u2013 and They Can Be Found in Healthy Foods\nLectins are, by their very nature, weak poisons: once they enter your body (and they do every time you consume fruits, wheat, legumes, etc.), they bind with the sugar molecules in your nerves and cause \u201cbrain fog\u201d (loss of focus, memory problem).\nIn addition, they also make the intestinal tract more permeable allowing the microbes from your gut to spill into unknown areas of your body where they are treated as impostors; hence \u2013 autoimmune diseases.\nFinally, some of them \u2013 such as the WGA in wheat \u2013 increase your weight; this was great for our ancestors when they needed \u201cwheat belly\u201d for the months when they had nothing to eat; but it\u2019s bad for you \u2013 since you always have something to eat.\nThe Four Rules of the Plant Paradox Program\nSteven Gundry\u2019s Plant Paradox Program is focused on eliminating lectins from your diet; and it is based on four rules:\n#1. What you stop eating has more impact on your help than what you start eating;\n#2. Give your gut bugs what they want and starve the bad bugs (see #1);\n#3. Treat fruit (everything with seeds) exactly as you would treat candy; and\n#4. You are what the thing you are eating ate, aka you\u2019re not eating meat but the soya it was fed with.\nThe Plant Paradox Program\nNow, \n \u2013 and, consequently, the Plant Paradox Program \u2013 abounds with many \u201cyes\u2019s\u201d and even more \u201cno\u2019s,\u201d in addition to numerous sample meal plans and recipes.\nIt\u2019s both difficult to summarize even a tenth of them and unfair to choose only one or two; for that, you\u2019ll need to consult the book.\nHowever, consider this a good rule-of-thumb: don\u2019t eat any fruit aside from green bananas, papayas, and mangoes, avoid refined, starchy foods, nuts and seeds, oils, grains and legumes \u2013 and you should do just fine.\nAt least Gwyneth Paltrow and Tony Robbins say so.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Plant Paradox Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nAccording to some doctors and professors (Terry Wahls, Dale Bredesen, Jonathan Karp) and numerous celebrities (\n, Kelly Clarkson, Gwyneth Paltrow), Gundry\u2019s lectin-free diet works exceptionally well. \nSo much so that at least one or two people have deemed Gundry a once-in-a-generation doctor and \na \u201conce-in-a-generation\u201d book.\nNow, we\u2019re not doctors, and we don\u2019t know for sure if Steven R. Gundry is right about lectins; but we feel obliged to tell you that, according to many other doctors and researchers, he\u2019s not.\n\u201cTo put it generously,\u201d says \n, \u201cit is fair to say that Dr. Gundry has not made a convincing argument that lectins as a class are hazardous.\u201d \n are not so subtle calling Gundry a quack and \u201cgobbledygook\u201d scientist trying to make a quick buck.\nThe latter sure seems at least a possibility: as far as we understood from a quick research, lectins are actually a pretty large and complex group of proteins, and even though some of them are toxic, others are actually beneficial.In other words, if you want our advice: don\u2019t jump the lectin-free bandwagon before you see where it\u2019s heading; \n.\n\n"},

And Why?\nWe all know of \n and his tone with regards to spiritual development.\nIn the past few years, he\u2019s had a lot of open sessions on spirituality and how to attain the much-vaunted peace. \nIn his YouTube videos, he gives his opinion on why stillness is best the weapon in the fight against aimlessness, depression, and despair. \nHence, \u201c\n\u201d is the ultimate guidebook for all people who want to find shelter and escape the madness of the material world. \nAbout Eckhart Tolle\nAccording to many, Eckhart is the voice of reason.\nEven celebrities such as Oprah, Jim Carrey have expressed their admiration for his words of wisdom, and how he changed their life, positively. \nAmong other things, he is also the author of \u201c\n\u201d (an international bestseller) and \u201c\n.\u201d\n\u201cStillness Speaks PDF Summary\u201d\nA real spiritual teacher does not feel the need to teach you how to survive nor which practices to follow. It doesn\u2019t give you any new information, on the contrary, it tries to free your mind from the conventional wisdom that keeps you hostage in the world of attachment. \nIn other words, a spiritual teacher attempts to \u201ctear down\u201d your belief system and leave you in total emptiness. \nWords conveyed up to this point act as a handbook that guides your efforts and incentivizes you to go deeper. With the help of a spiritually-awakened person, you must subdue the surge of thoughts, and tame the restless mind. \nThis form of teaching originates from ancient times, sometimes even enriched with the sutras of ancient India. \nJust to be clear, sutras represent powerful pointers to the inner truth, with very little conceptual focus. \nNot just the ancient sutras, but the entire flow is merely an illustration of the stillness that speaks. \nThe main thrust of Eckhart Tolle\u2019s message is the fact that his word is in no way connected to any religion. It\u2019s free from ties and meaningless indoctrination techniques. \nIt speaks on behalf of humanity.\nWhen silence is replaced with noisiness, you have abandoned yourself. \nThis stillness is not something that can fade away, nor is it a \u201cthing\u201d one can attain. It\u2019s the very core of your true self. \nIf that\u2019s the case, then how come I don\u2019t see it?\nThe inner awareness is not something you can see; it\u2019s the thing that sees. It\u2019s the all-watchful eye of the soul, not a thing you should pursue to have in your possession.\nOn a busy day or a morning rush hour, you can feel the tension; it\u2019s almost as if the negativity penetrates your heart. \nWell, the external noise is by no means more damaging than the internal chaos. \nLook at a tree, take a look at a plant, allow your mind to get back into its original state of silence. \nWhen silence becomes the driving factor in your life, peacefulness will emerge. We have been misled completely with the notion that happiness is a result of something attained after a long and arduous journey. \nFrom a spiritual standpoint, drawing happiness from the material world reflects an adrenaline surge. It doesn\u2019t yield permanent benefits, only momentary satisfaction.\nReal intelligence is hidden beneath the surface.\nThe tide of thoughts wields enormous influence over your life. And every single one that pops into your head is perceived with extreme care. \nHere\u2019s a tip for you:\nYour thoughts are not that important, let alone genuine! \nYou\u2019ve been a victim to a sequence of imposed opinions, beliefs and emotions. It\u2019s time to snap out of it, and allow stillness to take over. \nNobody denies the practicality of thinking, Eckhart Tolle only divulges information regarding the limitations of the mind and how you can overcome them. \nKeep in mind that the shallowest form of life is one of the thought. \nThroughout history, nothing has caused more suffering than the agendas and dogmas adopted by the members of a certain community. \nIf you continue to identify with the thought, you\u2019ll remain imprisoned. \nThe stream of thoughts hampers the spiritual awakening and withers the inner evolvement. \nIf you intend to grasp the truth while resting on the mind as the only channel, brace yourself for a big surprise.\nThe mind is confined in its essence, and all of its fruits are somewhat tainted. \nThe egoic sense of self is powered by the need for identity, and the desire to obtain status. Eckhart Tolle portrays it like a wild animal in pursuit of meat, one that must constantly feed itself in order to survive. \nThe main question is \u2013 when you say \u201cI\u201d what are you referring to? Your story, or perhaps your religion? \nBy no stretch of the imagination is this sense of \u201cI\u201d constant and not-fluctuating. It\u2019s prone to twists and modifications based on the environmental hurdles that it comes across. \n, this is a self-destructive reality, but to you is a form of liberation. \nAsk yourself \u2013 who is the observer or the seer of thoughts? Who is aware of the restless nature of the mind, who sees the psychological effects of a certain phenomenon that takes place in your mind? \u2013 No, you can\u2019t see the seer; you can only be that. \nThe deeper sense of \u201cI\u201d contradicts the need to control the past and the future. \nThe preoccupation with what is to come is entirely within the real of the Ego. \nThe victim culture or the victim mentality only adds to this dangerous ideology that basically manifests the kinetic energy of the ego. \nA great deal of sadness stems from this perpetual tendency to condition your existence.\nAnd you do just that when you undermine the only thing that can\u2019t and will not evaporate \u2013 the present moment. \nIf you think that being in the Now requires mental strength, then you better change your tune. \nThere\u2019s not one thing that has happened in the future, and yet we feel hesitant to embrace the reality. \nYou are not your thoughts; you are not your mind, you are not your emotions \u2013 you are the witness that keeps a watchful eye on these rising tendencies. \nMost of the things about life are evaluated through the eyes of the community. Your status or position in society is also under heavy scrutiny, and the life you live is under constant bombardment by the societal norms of success. \nIt seems that, if you are not good-looking and rich, you don\u2019t deserve to be happy.\nSocietal stature holds no meaning whatsoever because it relates to conceptual indoctrination, not the true self. If you only want to scratch the surface, then hunting down your imaginary enemies will suffice. However, if you have a genuine desire to delve deeper, then you have to relieve yourself from all the brands, labels and false titles attributed to your sense of self. \nOnce you crush the inner resistance, you\u2019ll be able to see who you actually are. \nSo, who are you?\nBy being aware of your true nature, as the awareness in which the floating and non-consistent appear, you\u2019ll become free of life-interpretations.\nLong story short, what happens on the outside will no longer be a relevant factor in how you interact with your core-self. All the things that once caused despair will be caught in the midst of this transition, never to rise again. \nAs a result, playfulness and cosmic dance will subtly take over your body & mind.\nYou\u2019ll no longer be obsessed to re-create situations that are long gone, nor you\u2019ll be inclined to agree with the overall projections of success. \nIt might occur to you that society is not on your side, and you\u2019ll also see how hard it is to stand with your shoulders straight. \nThe habits that once were the embodiment of your life-choices will begin to die out. The self-identity portrayed as the egoic consciousness requires your attention to function, and if you don\u2019t give your energy to it \u2013 it\u2019s game over.\n believe that the best way to tackle this tendency is to do one thing at a time. \nJust forget about asking questions like:\nBy continuing this battle, you\u2019re doing the opposite of surrender. \nSurrender to the flow of life, and forget about pulling the strings! \nThe interrelatedness of all things is what Buddhism has known and has preached since its early beginnings. Physicists of the modern age, now have the means and resources to look into it and uphold these beliefs.\nThe more we put labels on our existence the more we deviate from the center. \nIf we really like to put an end to all the suffering, we must look at freedom as much more than a concept. \nIt reflects one\u2019s liberation from the cultural, religious, social and personal features. \nIt\u2019s about embracing the moment and living the life in accordance with this law. Only then we can experience the end of suffering. \u00a0\nSuffering truly is a broad term, and everyone interprets it differently. The analogy of it is quite disturbing because it signifies the ignorance of the humankind. \nHappiness and peace don\u2019t need any strings attached to validate their existence, whilst unhappiness and suffering need to cling onto something, or better yet a personal story. This conceptual identity derives its legitimacy from our interpretation of a certain life-situation and fuels the existence of the egoic-self by perceiving it as the only reality.\nThe \u201csuchness\u201d of each moment (not in time, but in presence) is not flexible! \nUnlike the past and future, the presence has no memories, no plans, and no pain. \nIt\u2019s not the situation that makes you unhappy, but your thoughts about it.\nIt all boils down to this \u2013 unhappiness has no authority in the Now.\nKey Lessons from \u201cStillness Speaks\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Noisiness = bad outcome \n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keep your wits\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Refrain yourself from plunging into mind-chatter\nNoisiness = bad outcome\nIt really doesn\u2019t come as a shock to anyone that whenever you are pissed off about something, you can\u2019t think rationally.\nThen why even bother mentioning this? \nBecause, according to Eckhart, being emotional is not on an equal footing as winning the inner argument.\nKeep that turbulence outside your head. \nKeep your wits\nThe world isn\u2019t a land of milk and honey. Sometimes, a given situation may overwhelm you, and pound you while you are down.\nRemember, people, grow roots when things get tough. \nDon\u2019t fight it, and accept that you don\u2019t have control over this predicament.\nRefrain yourself from plunging into mind-chatter\nNo matter how many times we say it or hear it; you should really know where to look for answers. The painful past and the unknown future, should not be your first choice.\nEckhart reckons that the present moment destroys all the concepts in its wake and the only thing you should do is embrace it.\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free \n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cStillness Speaks Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nAre you ready to sit back and let it go? \nIt\u2019s something similar to being stranded on a deserted island, and the only thing left for you to do is to accept your present moment. \nBy accepting, Eckhart Tolle doesn\u2019t mean forcefully admitting defeat. \nIt indicates our inner realization of the only thing that never changes (The Now) \u2013 your true self.

And Why?\nWe\u2019ve already provided you with a fair share of summaries of books written by the women leaders of today for the women leaders of tomorrow.\nYou can find brief summaries \u2013 as well as links to longer ones \u2013 of some of the best among them \n.\nLet\u2019s just say that \nwould have been on that list if we had the chance and the time to read it earlier.\nSo, all you businesswomen and female entrepreneurs out there \u2013 take note! Especially if, like Ye\u015fil, you\u2019re in the tech industry.\nThe world of tomorrow needs you; and you need to hear how the women shaping it got to do just that. It\u2019ll be easier afterward.\nAbout Magdalena Ye\u015fil\n is a San Francisco-based Turkish-American entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and investor of Armenian heritage.\nAn immigrant already at the age of 18, Ye\u015fil came to the United States in 1976 with less than $50 dollars and no more than two suitcases filled with the essentials. \nIn barely few decades, Ye\u015fil grew to become one of the most recognizable females in the tech industry, board member of some of the world\u2019s top tech companies (SoFi, Smartsheet, Zuora), and one of the founders the first investor in Salesforce, the cloud-based software pioneer.\nAfter having a stint as a general partner at U.S. Venture Partners, Ye\u015fil founded some of the earliest e-commerce and Internet access start-ups in modern history: UUnet, CyberCash, and MarketPay; this earned her the coveted Entrepreneur of the Year title by the \n magazine.\nYe\u015fil is also the founder of Broadway Angels \u2013 a group of female angel investors and venture capitalists \u2013 and DriveInformed, her fourth startup.\nFind out more at \n \n\u201cPower Up PDF Summary\u201d\nIf you are living in the United States, then most of the things happening in the country during the past few decades may seem to you strange \u2013 especially in relation to employees\u2019 rights.\nAfter all \u2013 and this goes to all those people saying that the gender gap is a myth and so on and so forth \u2013 until very recently, you could barely find a single company in America offering maternity leave.\nTranslation:\nIf you were a woman and you got pregnant, then you had no choice but to leave your job \u2013 unless you wanted to abort.\nIn other words, you had to choose: either a mother or a successful businesswoman.\nAnd, in some ways, things haven\u2019t evolved past a certain point even today; but they sure have changed \u2013 and it is time women start rewriting the rules.\nThe Three Principles of Powering UP\nBefore becoming a multimillionaire and a respected board member of so many hi-tech companies, Magdalena Ye\u015fil was an engineer just like many others.\nAnd one time, during her first engineering job, she designed a semiconductor chip; it wasn\u2019t the best thing in the world, but, in her opinion, it wasn\u2019t the worst either.\nHowever, her bosses certainly thought otherwise; after she presented to them the chip\u2019s logic functions, she was severely criticized by almost each of them.\nNow, she could have bottled up or replied back, but Magdalena choose the only sensible solution: she decided to be attentive and listen to every word coming in her direction.\nWhy?\nBecause these were people with much more experience than her and because she was merely a beginner.\nThis brings us to the second principle of powering UP: staying firm on your course even after making a mistake, no matter how terrible.\nIn fact, the unsuccessful first attempt at designing a semiconductor chip described above is not very high on the list of Ye\u015fil\u2019s things to regret.\nSomewhere around the top is her decision to reject Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak\u2019s job offer in the early days of Apple.\nThe reason?\nShe was advised by a fellow worker to never accept a job at a tech company named after a fruit.\nThe logic wasn\u2019t sound, but it certainly influenced Ye\u015fil\u2019s rejection which, very soon, started hurting her like hell.\nBut did she give up?\nNo \u2013 she didn\u2019t.\nShe just got out the best of the situation: a lesson for the future. \nIn her case: always make informed decisions.\nAnd once you gather enough info about a certain thing, then don\u2019t look back; even if it doesn\u2019t work out in the end, this won\u2019t happen that often; \n, chances are, once you are informed about something, you\u2019ll be right more than 50% of the time. And that is enough.\nTake Marc Benioff, for example (by the way, the author of the foreword to \n).\nThe guy was a vice president at Oracle and, yet, he decided to give up on it all and found his own company, Salesforce.\nHe had no more than 10 employees at the beginning, but he acted confident in front of them as if he knows where the path would lead him.\nHe didn\u2019t.\nBut his confidence paid off: he\u2019s now worth more than $6 billion.\n(And, by the way, it is \n; so great job, Marc!)\nThe Benefits of Intrapreneurship\nLet\u2019s just say that you are a teenager with an idea which, you believe, may change the world.\nDo you:\na) gather some money and found a startup; or\nb) find a job at a company in a similar niche?\nYou probably guess that the right answer \u2013 contrary to what most people would say \u2013 is the latter one. At least as far as Magdalena Ye\u015fil is concerned.\nHer reasons for this?\nWell, first of all, you\u2019re probably not ready for a start-up; not only in terms of knowhow but also in terms of the effort you\u2019ll be required to put in for it to work. Think 24/7 \u2013 and this is not an exaggeration.\nSteady paycheck and regular hours will help you build a much necessary pace before you dive in headward into the unknown.\nIn addition \u2013 as it should be only obvious \u2013 working for another company would result in enhancing your skillset for the future.\nFinally, it\u2019s a neat way to ensure future investors. After all, who do you think your boss at this company will be more willing to give his money: a dedicated worker or an unknown teenager?\nOvercoming the Gender Pay Gap\nDo you know why people resist change?\nBecause change opens the door to the unknown and the unexpected; and because, even when wrong, the status quo is at least predictable.\nWell, this is the reason why women face so many problems in the workplace, sometimes receiving \n.\nYe\u015fil\u2019s advice:\nPower UP!\nGo and get what you deserve.\nAnd be prepared to fight for it in advance.\nShe lists a few examples of women who were denied a promotion because of their inability to document their talents and competencies.\nNo \u2013 we\u2019re not talking about CVs and portfolios!\nWe\u2019re talking about documenting the results of every single of your own decisions, especially when you\u2019re at a higher level in a company.\nThat way, when you go to your boss to demand a raise or a promotion, you will be the one prepared for him \u2013 and he will not be for you!\n(Yes, we chose to write \u201che\u201d for a reason.)\nHow to Get an A in Attitude and an F in Victim\nAs you have probably realized by now, \nadvocates a no-nonsense approach to almost everything; and that includes sexual harassment as well.\nTired of all of those rude comments from the male colleagues in your office?\nTime to develop some gravitas.\nSuit up, \n, and make eye contact with the person who makes the comment. \nNow say one of these three things:\n: \u201cNow, what exactly do you mean?\u201d\n: \u201cI know you think you\u2019re funny, but I\u2019m uncomfortable with your sense of humor; hopefully, you\u2019ll be smart to accept that.\u201d\n: \u201cThe head of HR said to me that he doesn\u2019t have a lot to do lately; perhaps you\u2019d want to visit him?\u201d\nWhat? Do these things sound too inappropriate?\nStrangely enough, most people seem to think that; assertive men are the leaders of the free world; assertive women are, well, bitches.\nYe\u015fil\u2019s advice: be a bitch until you give that word a new meaning. \nIt\u2019s better to be a bitch than a martyr \u2013 10 out of 10 times.\nNot just for you.\nMommy Guilt Is a Liar\nYes \u2013 \n.\nWe\u2019ll repeat it because it\u2019s true: maternity leave doesn\u2019t spell the end of your career, and being successful businesswoman doesn\u2019t mean giving up on building a family.\nThe truth is you can do all of those things simultaneously; the key: find a way to feel empowered in your career.\nMagdalena\u2019s mother Selma, for example, had to give up her promising career in medicine because she was expected to raise her children.\nOf course, this eventually resulted in many regrets and, what\u2019s worse, a bitter attitude toward everything.\nHowever, when at 63, Selma got a job \u2013 the first one in her whole life \u2013 as a barista in a Whole Foods Market, suddenly her life transformed.\nWhy?\nBecause she started feeling that she doesn\u2019t exist anymore \nsomeone or something; she was finally in a position to say: \u201cI can make a contribution by being myself; and I can work \n myself.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s the point: all those idealizations aside, motherhood is a sacrifice; but nobody is able to sacrifice his time or wishes for someone else until he/she figures out some things for himself/herself.\nOtherwise, it\u2019s too much of a burden.\nKey Lessons from \u201cPower Up\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You Have Much More Power Than You Think\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Three Characteristics of Powered-Up Women\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Be an Intrapreneur Before You Become an Entrepreneur\nYou Have Much More Power Than You Think\n\u201cWithin each of us,\u201d says Magdalena Ye\u015fil, \u201clies 100 percent of the capability needed to overcome the obstacles to any goal we set for ourselves. You are much more powerful than you think.\u201d\nAnd you \n \u2013 even though you sometimes feel as if a powerless victim to many passed-up promotions and comments by your male colleagues which border on sexual harassment.\nIf taking matters in your own hands requires you to become a bitch \u2013 then become one.\nNo matter what they say, even condescending \n.\nThe Three Characteristics of Powered-Up Women\nAccording to Magdalena Ye\u015fil, powered-up women share three traits:\n1. They are their own primary energy source;\n2. They refuse to accept the rules as they are written; and\n3. They never define themselves by gender or any other exclusion parameter or allow anyone else to do the same.\nMagdalena Ye\u015fil\u2019s word of advice:\nBe an Intrapreneur Before You Become an Entrepreneur\nThis lesson goes to all the entrepreneurs out there, men or women.\nUnless you are some kind of a genius, then it\u2019s better to have some work experience before you decide to create your own start-up.\nIf you\u2019re working in the niche, you can even be an intrapreneur \u2013 building your own company from within a company (aka partnership).\nThat\u2019s what experienced intrapreneur Debra Rossi did while working as the executive vice president of Wells Fargo; namely, she recognized the potential of eBay and brought both herself and her company a lot of money.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cPower Up Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nEven if you don\u2019t know Magdalena Ye\u015fil\u2019s name \u2013 as you have probably already read in her biography \u2013 you\u2019re quite familiar with some of her work; and you\u2019ll have to agree that the things she has done \u2013 despite being one of the first women in the tech world \u2013 are more than admirable.\nWell, in \n, in the words of Caroline Simard, she \u201coffers powerful leadership lessons from her journey to becoming a successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur and investor. She drops the readers into the vividly recounted, career-defining moments to help them navigate and overcome gender bias in their own lives.\u201d\nMurat S\u00fcnmez, member of the World Economic Managing Board, agrees, claiming that \n\u201cshould be required reading for anyone building a company or making a career\u201d and that Ye\u015fil\u2019s lessons \u201care more relevant than ever.\u201d\nSo, to use a lousy wordplay, you really need to power up with \n.\nEspecially if you are a woman."},

And Why?\nJust like a few other women whose struggles for order and wellbeing in the midst of chaos we\u2019ve already covered \u2013 think \n or \n \u2013 Emily Ley is the be-all and end-all of 24/7 people: a mother, a wife, a successful designer, a business owner.\nIf you are in a similar situation and have the feeling that you\u2019re expected to be more than one person, then \nis a book you should definitely include on your reading list.\nIt should help you order your life through prioritization and simplification.\nIt also comes with a \n and a \n; the latter, combining Ley\u2019s experience, knowledge and unique eye for aesthetic details, promises to be the perfect companion to this book.\nAbout Emily Ley\n is an American designer and writer, an advocate for simpler living, and the Founder and Creative Director of Emily Ley Paper & Gifts.\nA graduate from the University of West Florida (with degrees in Public Administration and English \u2013Creative Writing), Ley became the Executive Director of the city ballet, before moving on to several management and PR jobs in the nonprofit department.\nIn 2008, she launched her own brand and made a name after she created the Simplified Planner\u00ae \u2013 \u201ca daily agenda for what matters most.\u201d The planner won her numerous awards, including Best New Product at the National Stationery Show and a place on the \u201cTop 10 Designers to Watch\u201d list by \n Magazine.\nIn a way, an explanation and an addendum to the Planner, \nwas her first book.\nFind out more at \n.\n\u201cGrace, Not Perfection PDF Summary\u201d\nIf you want a summary of Emily Ley\u2019s book in two words, then probably these two words are \u201cbalance\u201d and \u201csimplicity.\u201d\nIf you want a summary of it in two sentences, then think along these lines: \u201cI will hold myself to a standard of grace, not perfection;\u201d and \u201cBy simplifying our lives, we\u2019re making space for what matters\u2014to hear God more clearly, to give more wholeheartedly, and to place our energy in people and hearts rather than in things.\u201d\nFinally, if you want a more extended summary of each of its three parts and fifteen chapters \u2013 then, read ahead!\nPart 1: Grace with Yourself\nIf you are struggling to fill in the roles of being a good wife, an even better mother and a talented individual with a successful career, then it\u2019s only natural that you\u2019ve already asked yourself the dreaded question: \u201cHow do \n do it?\u201d\nEmily Ley \u2013 just like \n, \n, and just about everybody \u2013 has a pretty straightforward answer to that question: they don\u2019t.\n\u201cEven if you can do it all,\u201d she writes, \u201cno one can do it all well.\u201d\nThe first lesson she learned on her road to happiness and bliss: we are all slaves of perfectionism because we have confused in our childhood the notion of being perfect with the idea of being worthy.\nThe latter is the only available standard.\nAnd the easiest way to achieve this standard?\nWell, just give yourself permission to just stop. Press pause as soon as possible, take a deep breath, and start analyzing your life. \nHave you ever done anything worthy \u2013 or even decent \u2013 when in a state of overcommitment?\nProbably not!\nBecause it\u2019s impossible to do \n when your heart is filled with \n. \u201cYou can\u2019t draw water from an empty well,\u201d says Emily Ley.\nAnd she makes a nice analogy:\n says, \u201couter order contributes to inner calm.\u201d\nEmily Ley adds: and outer order is all about three organizing systems:\n1. Organizing your time;\n2. Organizing your belongings;\n3. Organizing your home.\nAs far as the organization of your time is concerned, you can\u2019t do much better than consulting \n; and as far as the other two are in question, \n might be the only guru you\u2019ll ever need.\nEverything is moving so fast around us that sometimes we forget what really matters.\nThe problem?\nThe only time we really come to our senses is when it\u2019s already too late. \nHow many stories do you know of people who are on their deathbeds and who are finally aware of how they spent too little time enjoying the great moments in life and too much of it ignoring them?\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to wait until the end of life,\u201d says Ley. \u201cRight this moment, we can construct our schedules in a way that allows us to truly savor the good stuff in between the have-to\u2019s of life.\u201d\nAnd the best way to do this:\nSlow down.\nAnd never sacrifice the good for the perfect.\n\u201cPerfection is overrated,\u201d writes Ley. As all children know: \u201cthere is joy in the mess.\u201d\nSo, stop worrying about everything going according to plan; it\u2019s time that you embrace life in all of its randomness and unpredictability.\nSometimes things get messy, true. But, that\u2019s the point: they will get messy no matter how much you try to avoid the messiness.\nSo, why don\u2019t you just stop doing that?\nFrom time to time \u2013 surrender control.\nPart 2: Grace with Your People\nHow many times have you had quarrels with your loved one just because they didn\u2019t do something according to your vision of life?\n\u201cJust like socks on the floor don\u2019t equal major character flaws,\u201d writes Emily Ley, \u201cdishes in the sink shouldn\u2019t always equal an argument.\u201d\nThe point?\nYou\u2019ll always have one or two things to argue about with your loved one; after all, both of you are individuals, and both of you have some expectations and dreams of freedom.\nThat\u2019s why picking your battles is much smarter than fighting all of them.\nIf \n yelling about socks on the floor gets you encouragement and a couple of warm hugs \u2013 then, really, should you even bother thinking about picking about the socks yourself?\nDo you know why you should let go arguing about the socks?\nBecause you have some dirty laundry in your closet as well!\nNo matter how special they are to us \u2013 all of the people we know are flawed in one way or another; yes \u2013 that includes us.\nAnd it is because of this that life is so rich; even though, it is also because of it that sometimes it\u2019s just too circus-like.\n\u201cI\u2019m slowly learning that my happiest, most special moments happen when the circus is at its peak,\u201d writes Emily Ley.\nBe aware of this sentence lest you learn this too late.\nHow many of your relationships are a burden to you?\nWhat?!\nDo you want to say that even the ones you have with your closest ones can be described in such a manner? But shouldn\u2019t they be the very opposite?\nLey thinks she knows the problem: you are trying too hard.\nInstead of letting yourself go and learning that good friendships are all about accepting each other\u2019s imperfectness, you are trying to be perfect even in front of the ones who\u2019d accept you the way you are.\nNow, stop doing that immediately.\nInstead, show yourself in all of your splendors and failings even in front of strangers; you can\u2019t even imagine the relief!\nRoutines in relationships are something you will never be able to get out of; we can think of a few films when people tried doing that (say, \n) but that never turns up the way you\u2019d expect it to.\nBecause the point is not doing away with routines in your relationships; it is choosing the ones you want. \nTo find them, a good starting point should be unearthing those parts in life which bring you the most stress and anxiety.\nNow think of a way to circumvent those through a routine; because, as you know full well, when you\u2019re in the middle of the routine you do things mechanically and feel nothing.\nThe upside?\nThat includes stress and anxiety as well.\n, there are things you can control in life and things you can\u2019t.\n\u201cThe chief task in life,\u201d wrote one of them: \u201cis simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals and not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control.\u201d\nBut what to do about the bad things that are not under your control?\nWell, accept them: \u201cYou control your perspective and the state of your heart in the situation you\u2019re in today \u2013 even when you can\u2019t control the circumstances. Choose gratitude.\u201d\nPart 3: Grace in Your Calling\nBack in your teenage years, you were infinite: in your mind, you were ready to become anything you want to, and the only thing you needed to do was choosing the right path.\nIf you are like 99% of the people, your path was all about your future job choice.\nThe problem?\nWell, your job is only a part of your life!\nWhat about your friends, your family, your hobbies, your dream vacations, your free time?\n\u201cWe talk so much about choosing jobs or selecting careers,\u201d writes Emily Ley. \u201cBut what if we chose a life instead? Whether you\u2019re 17 or 75, you can define the life you want to have. Better yet, you can decide how you want to spend your days.\u201d\nLiving the life you want to begins with defining it.\nThink about that.\nOf course, defining the life you want to is merely a part of it; it\u2019s then when the real work starts. \nIn this chapter, Ley describes how her life turned out the way it is, and how much messiness the process entailed:\nA necessary chapter to reiterate the main idea, this time in relation to your family.\nNamely, feeling as if you are not the perfect mother is natural; so natural, in fact, that every mother feels it.\nHowever, if that\u2019s the case, doesn\u2019t this mean that it\u2019s also something which is not correct?\nAfter all, most of us have turned out fine.\nIt\u2019s in your blood to be a good mother.\nDon\u2019t listen to the little voice in the head.\nIt is the voice of your Neanderthal ancestress who lived in a very different time and age.\nContentment, according to the \n, is a state of happiness and satisfaction.\nIt\u2019s something you crave for, but also something you must make room for in your life.\nThe best way to do this is to simplify matters and start making things happen.\nThat\u2019s the very essence of what life is all about.\n\u201cComparison,\u201d writes Ley, \u201cis the thief of joy.\u201d\nSo, don\u2019t allow yourself to mar your contentment by way of comparison with some people who, on the face of it, look happier than you.\nBelieve us, they too have serious, serious problems.\nYou should love yourself and your life much more than that.\nKey Lessons from \u201cGrace, Not Perfection\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Good Is Better Than Perfect\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Savor the Messiness and the Chaos\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Choose the Life You Want to Live \u2013 and Not Job You Want to Work\nGood Is Better Than Perfect\nTo paraphrase Emily Ley, perfectionism is the true killer of joy.\n\u201cTrue joy isn\u2019t found in having it all together,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe good life is rich, slow, real, and flawed.\u201d\nIn other words, if you want to live a perfect life \u2013 paradoxically \u2013 accept its imperfectness.\nDon\u2019t sacrifice the good to chase the perfect.\nThe former is \n better.\nSavor the Messiness and the Chaos\nNo matter how much all of those photographs on Facebook and Instagram try to convince you in the opposite, unfiltered, even the lives of the happiest among us are as messy and as chaotic as you\u2019d expect them to be.\nThe difference between them and you?\nThey\u2019ve decided to embrace the messiness and savor the circus.\nBecause they know that, at the end of it, these will be some of their happiest days.\nChoose the Life You Want to Live \u2013 and Not Job You Want to Work\nIf you are younger and still undecided over your career, then this is the perfect moment to stop thinking of a career.\nNot because you shouldn\u2019t have one \u2013 everybody needs money, after all; but because your job is merely a tiny part of your life.\nSo, instead of thinking about it, it\u2019s much better to think about the big picture.\nDefine the life you want to live \u2013 and then go for it!\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cGrace, Not Perfection Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nThe simple, guiding idea of \nis revealed already in the title of the book. \nIf you are a woman and you think that you can achieve that without a guiding light, then you don\u2019t need this or any other book. In fact, if that\u2019s the case \u2013 congratulations, you\u2019ve found the perfect formula for bliss and happiness! \nshould be the one writing books for the rest of us.\nHowever, if you want some help decluttering your day-to-day schedule and your ever-exhausted mind \u2013 and you are a Christian or have no problems accepting a bit (and maybe, a bit too much) of the Christian God in your heart \u2013 then do consider letting Emily Ley in your life. \nIt\u2019s not that her ideas are new or revolutionary; but, let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s always easier when you have someone telling you what to do and when to do it.\nBeautifully designed and straight-to-the-point, \n is a beautiful life-changing \u2013 and life-saving \u2013 gift.\nBut before deciding to give it to somebody else \u2013 give it to yourself first."},

It\u2019s not enough to play the game. You have to rule the game. If you can\u2019t keep up, you lose, become one with the background and are forgotten instantly.\nLearning still represents the main prerogative of overcoming failures. Maybe theories are beautiful and make you believe in the perfect world, perfect idea, and perfect solution. But what stands between these theories and reality?\nAll the lessons that Jack and Suzy Welch have put in this book are built around 5 key-concepts:\nSo, let\u2019s see how Jack and Suzy Welch describe mission.\nFrom their points of view, mission is the leitmotif of any organization by defying its destination: \n.\nTo get to the best destination you have to get the best mission which is built on three levels: \n.\nIn order to get where you want, you definitely have to catch the right \u201ctrain\u201d.

If you think is still difficult to understand it, read the authors approaches from this book, related to this subject. Building a genuine leader is about truth and trust. \nAnd to get the real leadership, what you have to do is:\nGrowth means a Mecca for each business dreamer. The way may seem to you being longer, but useful and straight when you do it right.\nSo, what brings growth to your business? Great leadership. Great teams. Great strategy. Great data crunching Great, refreshed compensation plans. All these lead to growth.\nYou\u2019ll find out in this book a generous part dedicated to this concept. You\u2019ll learn how to build a \u201cwow\u201d team by using classical approaches as a main part of a smart strategy. After reading it, you may rethink about how hiring, motivating, developing, and retaining your best players should be done.\nIt is no use to deny that money is the engine of every business. It might seem hypocritical to say something like this.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the real problem with growth isn\u2019t the amount of dollars you make available for your business. This is more about how you strategically allocate them.\nYou\u2019ll find in Real life MBA a great approach on this topic. I let you discover it on your own.

the book won the \n and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award.\n\u201cBad Blood PDF Summary\u201d\nNo \u2013 this has nothing to do with Taylor Swift.\nAlthough the main protagonist \n a charismatic, blond female wunderkind and millionaire born in the penultimate decade of the 20\n century.\nAnd, just like a Taylor Swift romance, she is just too good to be true \u2013 until, suddenly, she isn\u2019t.\nHer name: Elizabeth Holmes.\nHer dream: to become the next \n.\nHence all the turtlenecks.\nElizabeth Holmes\u2019 Great Idea\nJust like almost everyone alive, Elizabeth Holmes was pretty afraid of needles.\nShe was barely 20 years old when she had a wonderful idea: to device a wearable patch which would do away with needles altogether!\nComprised of numerous microneedles, the patch was supposed to be cheap and promised to make wonders in terms of blood testing and early diagnoses.\nThe problem?\nIt couldn\u2019t be built: microneedles didn\u2019t take the proper amount of blood for the blood tests to work.\nEven though many medical professionals told Holmes this before she even made a single step toward making this dream reality, she persisted.\nIn 2004, she teamed up with Shaunak Roy \u2013 one of her peers at Stanford University \u2013 and she founded Theranos.\nIn the meantime, their idea evolved to something like this:\nSo, in a nutshell, a revolutionary device, one that could democratize healthcare.\nHolmes and Roy believed that this device \u2013 dubbed the Edison \u2013could also perform tests for 240 different ailments \u2013 so, it was basically the next big thing.\nNow, who wouldn\u2019t want to hop on that train?\nThe Plot Thickens: the Edison Can\u2019t Be Built\nAs you are already aware by now, neither this miracle credit-card-sized blood-testing machine was just that \u2013 a miracle.\nBut in the bad sense; meaning: it was much more part of Elizabeth Holmes\u2019 fantasies than it was part of reality.\nAs it turned out, the blood sample the machine took was just too small to be used in more than a few tests, let alone 240!\nTimothy Hamill, vice chairman of the Department of Laboratory Medicine at the University of California, knew this beforehand, claiming that 240 separate tests on a single drop of blood would never be possible due to the nature not of the tests, but of the substance it tests: blood.\nHowever, nobody seemed to believe Hamill; on the other hand, everybody was more than happy to believe the endlessly charismatic wunderkind that was Elizabeth Holmes, by the way daughter of Christian Rasmus Holmes IV, \n.\nInvestors Are Coming, Employees Are Leaving\nAs far as Elizabeth Holmes was concerned, not being able to build the Edison wasn\u2019t a problem: she was too busy enjoying her fame to be burdened by such minor setbacks.\nAlso, she was too busy attracting investors \u2013 and they seem to be arriving at a world record pace.\nBy 2014, helped by Oracle\u2019s very own \n, and the ad agency famous for collaborating with Jobs and Apple (TBWA\\Chiat\\Day), Theranos had already made a couple of lucrative deals and reached a value of almost $9 billion!\nBy this time, Holmes was so confident of her product, that she started throwing away numbers and unsubstantiated claims by the minute.\nLike, for example, that the test results Edison prints in less than half an hour and that they cover not just 240, but as much as 800 different tests!\nNow, why did the investors buy this?\nThe correct answer to that question would be \u201coh, boy where should we start?\u201d followed by numerous excerpts from \nThe short answer looks like this:\n\u2022 Because of FoMO, the Fear of Missing Out;\n\u2022 Because Theranos covered up all of the Edison\u2019s flaws systematically, testing the blood of angel investors and test-patients on third-party machines and presenting the results as original;\n\u2022 Because Theranos dodged FDA inspections, by claiming that the Edison was simply an information tool and wasn\u2019t subject to FDA regulations;\n\u2022 Because it cherry-picked for demonstrations only tests which worked (the Edison did work well in relation to about 20 tests about 20% of the time);\n\u2022 Because it made its employees sign confidentiality agreements which prevented them from talking even after resigning;\n\u2022 Because Elizabeth Holmes\u2019 boyfriend, Ramesh \u201cSunny\u201d Balwani, started filling the empty chairs with Indian workers, dependent on their work visas to stay in the USA.\nNeed we say more?\nThe Epilogue\nSince the Edison was touted as a success by so many people, one of Theranos\u2019 lucrative deals was with none other than Walgreens.\nThe second-largest pharmacy store chain in the US started offering in-store blood tests at more than 40 locations and even had some plans to expand these \u201cwellness centers\u201d when all hell broke loose.\nTheranos, Elizabeth Holmes and Sunny Balwani were all exposed to be liars and falsifiers, and the company went all but bankrupt in 2018.\nIn addition, it was forced to repay $4.65 million to residents of Arizona, where more than million people used the Edison to test themselves.\nNobody knows how many of them suffered because of the false results; it is widely speculated that many may have even died.\nKey Lessons from \u201cBad Blood\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Great Idea Doesn\u2019t Make for a Great Product\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Investors\u2019 Quandary: The Fear of Missing Out\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You Can\u2019t Build a Bus While You\u2019re Driving It\nA Great Idea Doesn\u2019t Make for a Great Product\nThe story of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos is, more than anything, a cautionary tale for all of those people dreaming to become the next Steve Jobs (who, by the way, wasn\u2019t exactly a nice person either).\nAll her faults aside, it\u2019s not like Elizabeth Holmes didn\u2019t have a great idea, one which had all the writing upon it that it is capable of changing the world forever, democratizing medicine and saving countless of lives due to early diagnosis.\nHowever, a great idea doesn\u2019t make for a great product and, whatever all those movies and self-help books are saying, sometimes it\u2019s much better to give up.\nEspecially when smart people are saying that your idea can\u2019t be put into practice. Because, simply put, as great as they sound, some things are impossible.\nAnd yet, Holmes, emulating the stubbornness of her idol Steve Jobs, persevered.\nCarreyrou describes her tragic endeavor in a must-quote passage:\nThe Investors\u2019 Quandary: The Fear of Missing Out\nImagine yourself in the place of an investor offered by someone the opportunity of investing money in a potentially revolutionary invention such as a cheap, carriable blood-testing machine.\nAlready more than familiar with those stories about people turning down the Beatles or the Queen and intelligent stockholders missing out on an opportunity to cash in on ideas such as the PC or Microsoft, it\u2019d be only natural for you to think twice before opting out.\nThe executives of Safeway \u2013 among many others \u2013 faced this quandary. They didn\u2019t like Sunny and liked even less the fact that they didn\u2019t get enough info. And yet they were still hesitant to walk away from the partnership.\n\u201cWhat if the Theranos technology did turn out to be game-changing?\u201d \u2013 Carrreyrou tries to guess their way of thinking. \u201cIt might spend the next decade regretting passing up on it.

It doesn\u2019t matter that your net-worth is well over a million when you can declare bankruptcy if you fall seriously ill and require medical treatment. \nNice analogy, let\u2019s delve into it!\nWho Should Read \u201cWhy We Want You To Be Rich\u201d? And Why?\nIf you believe that rich people are afraid of seeing other people getting wealthy, you better think again. \nThis is not a video game, but the real world. \nA better economy means more opportunities for people to get out of poverty, so you becoming rich is in everyone\u2019s best interest! \nWhat\u2019s the problem then?\nThe victim-mentality is seeping into America, creation generations of underdogs who believe they have the right to the American Dream. \nThe world is changing at a rapid pace, and all the things that were once relevant are fading into obscurity, therefore \u201c\n\u201d is the book of the future. \nAbout Donald J. Trump & Robert T. Kiyosaki\nWhen \n wrote this book in 2006, nobody expected that he would become the 45\n US President. \nApart from showcasing political prowess, no one can undermine his success in the real-estate business. Many Americans see his entrepreneurial mindset as a way of bringing America to the top, as the world top economic and military superpower. \n on the other end, is a well-known business teacher, author, and the founder of Rich Global LLC.\nIn his books, he zooms in on the need for conducting a full-scale financial education to heal the American economy.\n\u201cWhy We Want You To Be Rich PDF Summary\u201d\nDonald Trump & Robert Kiyosaki have one thing in common \u2013 the wits to make money. Both can be labeled as successful entrepreneurs who have a vision and make smart moves. They are also best-selling authors and persons who are fearful of America\u2019s lack of financial education.\nBefore we take things onto the next level, it\u2019s vital to mention that there are three levels of financial advice:\nHere and there, you\u2019ll find people talking about finances and how to increase your assets value, but no one gives any actionable advice. It stands to reason why you should consider altering your approach, but when it comes to money, nobody is willing to take any chances.\nTransparency emerges as the new swipe at the face of misleading information!\nTruthfully, people are not inclined to follow a certain agenda, without being absolutely sure that it will not backfire on them. And, because American society is not exactly financially literate, the US continues to increase its debt and lose market opportunities. \nThe once well-known Dream is coming to a halt, and giving more money to the hands of the poor only aggravates the problem. \nContrary to the socialist mindset, taxing the \u201cRich\u201d and giving it to the poor is merely a death-wish for the American Economy.\nLet\u2019s see why:\nDonald Trump & \n voice concern about the enormous debt that continues to accumulate and it now exceeds the combined value of all the bonds and stocks, globally.\nAccording to Trump, one of the obvious reasons is the nurturing of the victim mentality and the idea of entitlement!\nThe American economy will cripple if the needs of all people are addressed because the money accumulated through taxes cannot cover government spendings!\nIf you have money problems, believe us when we say you are not the only one. If you want to become rich and create opportunities, then you must practice the craft of dealing with financial liabilities as they incur.\nApart from not yielding to fear, you also need to make smart moves under pressure and perform when things get rough. Every generation has its challenges, and yours is not excluded from that reality.\nIn the 20\n century, we had stuff like \n, WW2, Communist Expansionism, etc. The antidote to this chaos was taking the safe route by going to school, finding a good job, and reaping all the benefits upon retirement.\nThis life-trajectory is no longer an option, and you need to find another path!\nTo do that, you need financial intelligence. Kiyosaki describes it as the ability to prosper and stay with both feet on the ground when things go south. For example, he addresses the never-ending soar of energy prices, and why when energy prices go up, the country follows on this decline.\nRobert Kiyosaki also mentions about plowing back into the Oil-business, because he gets 70% write-off + 15% depletion allowance upon investing.\nIf you think that putting up money in something is merely a risk-taking endeavor, then you surely are far from reaching success. Investing is not about calculating risks; it revolves around the process of taking the right actions that can bring profits.\nIt needless to say that 10% of Americans own or possess 90% of the wealth, and the gap doesn\u2019t seem to disappear. \nKiyosaki argues that currently, he is not a professional Golf player because he cannot fall into that 10%, and the same goes for singing, NBA, you name it. \nIn other words, you need to choose the battle you can win!\nDonald Trump follows up on this and says that being stubborn is an inevitable path to success. \nQuitters don\u2019t make it far, and never shall. \nSome don\u2019t want you to succeed, and they would rather stamp you out, but that\u2019s not an excuse for backing down.\nYou might think that \n pretty much follow the same rules, lean on the same logic, and make the same moves, but that\u2019s not the case. Passive investors nurture a mindset that compels them to think and act in accordance with the motives listed below:\nThe main difference between rich, poor, and middle class is leverage. Investing and saving can never be put on an equal footing because one of them requires an excessive time-frame to pay off, and you may have some clue about which one that is. \nInvestors are mainly cagey about sharing their secret sauce, unlike Donald and Robert who see the threat in leaving people to \u201crot\u201d in poverty.\nWhen we discuss investments, the questions you need to ask are: \nBut even when you have all the tricks in your pocket, if you don\u2019t act in the face of fear, you cannot win. \nIn this summary, we try to make a distinction between active and passive investors and help you see the big picture as well. Probably, the most genuine depiction of how they differ is the fact that passive ones fear lacking money, while active ones see it as a challenge.\nIn addition, passive ones tend to choose more risk-free investments, while active ones opt for real-estate investments and business enhancement. \nPreviously we said something about leverage, and perhaps you cannot discern any meaning from it. However, leverage simply means, the ability to achieve or do more with less. \nIt\u2019s no wonder why we hear the slogan \u201c\n\u201d all the time. Have you ever seen a mediocre person who has achieved something extraordinary? No, because the mindset of that individual, keeps him/her in a state of chaos. \nTo sum it up, let\u2019s list the five things you need to have in order to find yourself at the top of the heap:\nThe biggest dilemma of all that upsets the socialist class is \u2013 Why the rich keep getting richer? \nFirst and foremost, it\u2019s much easier to invest when you have the resources to do so. However, many lottery winners have declared bankruptcy in a three-year time-frame after winning millions of dollars. That shows \u2013 giving money to people without financial education is not going to get them out of poverty. \nThe truth of the matter is that you don\u2019t need to bail out of school, nor to quit from your 40-hour job but shift your perception of life. \nThere are a number of games or let\u2019s say extracellular activities that can stimulate parts of your brain to make better decisions. This particularly applies to finances and managing money in general. \nLast but not least, it\u2019s much easier to succeed if you have a good role model. \nDonald Trump singles out his father as the main figure that helped him to succeed, while Robert gives credit to the \u201cRich Dad\u201d across the street who taught him so many things. \nNow the ball is on your side of the court.\nKeep learning, keep expanding otherwise you\u2019ll get the short end of the stick.\nKey Lessons from \u201cWhy We Want You To Be Rich\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Find out whether your father has the entrepreneurial mindset\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Be prepared to face the hurdles along the way\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tackle the comfort\nFind out whether your role model has the entrepreneurial mindset\nAn old adage says \u2013 there\u2019s freedom in manual labor and we agree on that. There\u2019s something profound about providing for your family and doing the hard work.\nNonetheless, the main issue is not the job itself, but the environmental demands. \nIf you prefer to keep administrators and executors out of your life, then you must educate yourself, financially. \nBe prepared to face the hurdles along the way\nYou might think, well how to change my mindset if I don\u2019t have any money, to begin with? How can I become a business owner or an investor if there\u2019s nothing in my bank account? \nTransition commences not when you have the chance to throw money around or squander profits. \nAs a matter of fact, it starts when the right attitude is in place, and hence the world will open up to you! \nTackle the comfort\nIf you don\u2019t feel like paddling to new unexplored shores, then no one can help you. Staying in one spot and waiting for a miracle to emerge is not something that is realistic. \nSo, you have to move beyond the comfort zone and embrace the uncertainty, or dive deep into the unknown should you prefer. \nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free \n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cWhy We Want You To Be Rich Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nWhenever someone mentions either Robert T.

After all, intelligence is not an exact science!\nAnd since Chabris and Simons are the first ones to agree with your claim, they have already conducted an experiment in a community where the numbers are much more precise and where they tell more than a simple story.\nNamely, the chess community.\nStrangely enough, Chabris and Simons uncovered much the same pervasion of this illusion of confidence: 75% of the chess players at the World Open in Philadelphia and the U.S. Amateur Team Championship in New Jersey thought that they were underrated.\nAnd not by little: by an average of 99 points!\nIn chess, it\u2019s pretty difficult to regularly beat an opponent rated 100 points above you; and yet, most of the people, despite numerous losses to precisely this kind of opponents, think that they can.\nIronically, if everyone who thinks should be rated higher is rated higher, the only thing that would change is the standard.\nAnd there\u2019s another twist to this story!\nNamely, in \nCharles Darwin observed that \u201cignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge.\u201d\nJustin Kruger and David Dunning proved this in an aptly titled 1999 study, \u201cUnskilled and Unaware of It.\u201d\nThe gist of it is a paradox: the less skilled you are, the less knowledge you have of your unskillfulness. Hence \u2013 the unwarranted confidence.\nThe Illusion of Knowledge: \u201cI Know More Than I Do\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re an expert in your field or not; in many cases, your guesses for the future may be just as good as the most uneducated person alive.\nWhy?\nSimply put, because we don\u2019t know the future and, no matter how much things we know about the present, there\u2019s always the chance (nay, the inevitability) of a black swan.\nConsider the following examples:\n\u2022 In 1957, Herbert Simon and Allen Newell, winners of the A.M. Turing Award in 1975 (Simon also won a Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978), predicted that a computer would be able to beat human chess players within a decade; they were very, very wrong;\n\u2022 In 1968, David Levy, a computer programmer and an avid chess player, bet four other computer scientists the very opposite: that no computer will ever be able to beat a human chess player; in 1989, Levy lost to Deep Thought and in 1997, Kasparov lost to IBM\u2019s Deep Blue;\n\u2022 Even better \u2013 not included in Chabris and Simons\u2019 book \u2013 Irving Fisher, USA\u2019s greatest economist at the time, predicted that the \u201cstock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau\u201d back in 1929; \n.\nSocrates believed that he knew nothing \u2013 and it was \n that he was dubbed the smartest man of his day and age by the gods.\nIt seems that there\u2019s a lot of truth somewhere in there; many people know a lot less than they claim that they do; and this is what Nassim Nicholas Taleb constantly raves against.\nIt\u2019s very, very, very dangerous to do that.\nThe Illusion of Cause: \u201cI\u2019m Not Superstitious\u2026 Just a Little Stitious\u201d\nLike it or hate it, \u201cour minds are built to detect meaning in patterns, to infer causal relationships from coincidences, and to believe that earlier events cause later ones.\u201d\nOn the face of it, there\u2019s nothing wrong with either of them \u2013 they all help us lead more meaningful lives, sometimes even guiding our most important decisions.\nFor example, a doctor guesses your disease based on a pattern of symptoms, and a sports coach establishes his tactics after carefully deducing the patterns noticed in the behavior of the other team.\nHowever, dig a little deeper, and you\u2019ll see the problem: it is because of these patterns that we sometimes don\u2019t see how random the world actually is.\nIn other words, there\u2019s no man on the moon \u2013 these are just some randomly scattered moon lakes; also, you can\u2019t really hear \u201cSatan\u201d when you play \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d backward unless you ready yourself to hear precisely that.\nAnd therein lies the rub: if we can only see the patterns we\u2019ve previously acquired, then we\u2019re pretty susceptible to brainwashing, not to mention inherently limited to a worldview created by our prejudices and superstitions.\nOf course, the place you\u2019re sitting at bears no relation to the score of the game; your brain just tricks you into seeing a pattern and creating a relation between two simultaneous events.\nThe truth is: you\u2019ll have to try pretty hard to beat it.\nThe Illusion of Potential: \u201cI Could Have Been Someone\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cI could have been someone,\u201d sings the male voice in The Pogues\u2019 brilliant \n.\n\u201cWell, so could anyone,\u201d answers the female singer.\nThis discussion sums up the last illusion analyzed by \n, the illusion of potential.\nThe illusion of potential, write Chabris and Simons, \u201cleads us to think that vast reservoirs of untapped mental ability exist in our brains, just waiting to be accessed\u2014if only we knew how.\u201d\nAnd it combines two beliefs.\nFirst and foremost, that \u201cbeneath the surface, the human mind and brain harbor the potential to perform at much higher levels, in a wide range of situations and contexts, than they typically do;\u201d and secondly, that \u201cthis potential can be released with simple techniques that are easily and rapidly implemented.\u201d\nYou know what we\u2019re talking about: no matter how many scientific studies claim otherwise \u2013 and regardless of the fact that it is utterly illogical \u2013 you still think that you use only 10% of your brain.\nAnd, thanks to many bad to average movies and false studies, that there are some things which can easily and promptly awaken the rest of your brain.\nFor example, do you know that if you listen to Mozart, you become instantly smart?\nOK.\nBut do you also know that this \u2013 and other claims such as these \u2013 have been transformed into multimillion-dollar businesses even though there\u2019s almost no scientific support for them?\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Invisible Gorilla Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nThere\u2019s a lot to like in \nand barely anything to be critical about. \u201cThought-provoking, entertaining, educational and sobering, this book is a must read for those honest enough to realize they don\u2019t or can\u2019t, know it all.\u201d (\n)\nDescribing it as \u201cengaging and humane,\u201d Paul Bloom, in a review for \n, goes a step further and says that \u201c\njust might teach us to be more humble, understanding and forgiving.\u201d\nHopefully, it will."},

And Why?\nis yet another business fable. \nMeaning: if you have so far enjoyed acquiring your business savvy from motivational parables (as opposed to textbook-styled non-fiction books), then this is most certainly the book to buy.\nLet us translate that for you in an even more relatable manner: if \n\u2013 to name just a few \u2013\nare on the top of your favorite business books list, then \nhas all the qualities to join them as soon as you open it.\nAbout Skip Prichard\n is an American business executive, CEO and president of OCLC, the company which founded and maintains WorldCat, the largest online public access catalog in the world.\nA graduate of University of Baltimore School of Law, Skip Prichard held a few executive positions with LexisNexis between 1995 and 2003, after which he moved on to work for ProQuest, where he eventually became CEO; before becoming the CEO of OCLC, he held the same position at Ingram Content Group Inc. as well.\nDeemed a \u201cstandout example\u201d by \n for his CEO engagement on the social media, Skip Prichard wrote \nafter interviewing \u201cover a thousand unbelievably successful people ranging from politicians to news anchors to sports heroes.\u201d\nHugely successfully, it is his only book so far.\n \u201cThe Book of Mistakes PDF Summary\u201d\nAs\nwe stated above, \nis a business fable.\nBut boy \u2013 is it a complicated one!\nYou see, unlike other business fables, this one interweaves three narrative arcs: one involving a monk on a mission in England of 1425, the second one involving a girl named Aria living in the American colonies in the 1770s, and the central one involving a depressed young man named David struggling in the present.\nBefore you think to yourself \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t come here to find out the plot of a postmodern novel\u201d \u2013 bear with us: \nmakes a lot of sense, and, even though there are three storylines, you can easily follow each of them.\nEngland, 1425: The Prologue\nThe first one is the shortest one: it is actually the prologue of the story.\nIt follows a monk with a mission and \n: \u201cthis mission he was on originated directly from the Prior, and it was as mysterious as the man himself. He didn\u2019t question. His job was to follow orders, dutifully fulfilling his vows.\u201d\nAnd the exact nature of the mission?\nFirst of all, carefully scribing ten copies of \u201can ancient book of wisdom from the desert lands of the far south, the lands of man-made stone mountains that reached to the sky.\u201d\nAnd then, distributing each of the manuscripts (one by one) to the Prior.\nThe reason?\nAfter the successful completion of these two missions, the monk burns the original manuscript.\nThe ten copies are then distributed: one stays with the Keeper of the Book, and the other nine reach the Nine Teachers who oversee the dissemination of the Book\u2019s knowledge.\n\u201cWhen will the entire world be ready for its wisdom?\u201d \u2013 the monk wonders. \u201cWill there be a day when the darker forces are so diminished that it will be freely available to all?\u201d\nThe American Colonies, the 1770s: Aria\nThe next two storylines are interweaved: after a few chapters covering the events in David\u2019s life (see below), follows one which covers the story of Aria, a young girl living in the American Colonies in the 1770s. \nAdvised by her uncle Raymond, she undertakes a journey of discovery and peril during which we learn more about the origins of the book scribed by the monk in the first storyline, as well as about its content and distribution.\nIt is in this narrative arc that we learn more about the roles of the Keeper and the Nine Teachers which are continuously chosen by him to spread the message of the book.\nAs Aria struggles to keep the mysterious Book safe from falling into the wrong hands, she also discovers the Three Laws of Success.\nWe\u2019ll get to them in a bit.\nUSA, Present Day: David\nA young man in his twenties, David is not exactly a happy person. \nHe feels overwhelmed with doubts and worries and has no idea which direction in life he should be taking.\nOne day, he gets \u201can unexpected, terse message\u201d from his boss: \u201cI need to see you in my office at 11:00.\u201d\nFearing that he would be fired and crippled by anxiety, before heading to his boss\u2019s office, he spends some time scanning the local news to clear his mind. \nThere, he reads a story of a prominent businessman lauded for his charitable work.\nLost in thought, he almost trips over a young, attractive woman struggling to grab some yellow papers blown out of her hands by the wind.\nAfter the meeting with his boss \u2013 during which he receives a verbal warning \u2013 David heads home, thinking about how important it would be \nAt home, he discovers a piece of paper in his pocket, reading: \u201cNORTH CAF\u00c9 10:00 a.m. Friday, September 14.\u201d\nAnd on the other side of it:\nThe letter is signed by the businessman mentioned in the newspapers, one of the most successful of his generation, a genuine \u201crags-to-riches\u201d story.\nSo, even though he knows that this must have belonged to the girl he almost tripped over, David decides to go on the meeting, believing that any connection made with such a successful businessman may bring him future glory.\nAnd it does \u2013 but not in the way he expects.\nRead our \u201cKey Lessons\u201d to find out more!\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Book of Mistakes\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 9 Mistakes You Should Never Make\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 3 Laws You Should Never Break\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 9 Secrets to Creating a Successful Future\nThe 9 Mistakes You Should Never Make\nDavid arrives at the North Caf\u00e9 and there he meets the businessman from the newspaper.\nDubbed the Old Man, he is not at all what David expects: casually dressed in faded jeans, a nondescript shirt and worn loafers, the Old Man has an unshaven face and a small leather book.\nAnd he reveals to David that he couldn\u2019t have discovered the invitation by mistake \u2013 because he is \u201cin a perfect state of mind\u201d to learn the lessons from the book.\nOK, says David, I\u2019m ready to listen. Give me the lessons.\n\u201cDo you think I can just hand them over to you?\u201d says the Old Man. \u201cI suppose I could\u2026 But the power wouldn\u2019t be there. I\u2019m not sure it would even work.\u201d\n\u201cYou have no idea the journey you are about to take,\u201d he goes on. \u201cNow that it has started, almost nothing can stop it. In fact, the teachers will appear at just the right time and in the most unlikely and unusual places. I wish I could be there myself. You\u2019ll have a rendezvous soon!\u201d\nAnd true to the Old Man\u2019s words, in the following weeks, Nine Teachers appear to David, each of them teaching him one of the 9 mistakes that can doom a person on his road to success.\nThe first teacher is the Playwright.\nShe was an actress once, but she decided to become a playwright when she learned the first mistake everyone makes: that there\u2019s no point in working on someone else\u2019s dream. \n\u201cWhen you act,\u201d she says, \u201cyou are fitting into the story. When you write, you are creating your own story.\u201d\nThe message from the Book:\nThe second teacher is the Banker, who teaches David that a penny is worth more than a penny, aka that it costs more to make a penny than a penny is worth.\nThe underlying lesson: never judge a book by its cover.\nDon\u2019t accept the limitations others put on you. \nJust allow yourself to \nyourself \u2013 this will unleash fantastic power.\nThe third teacher is the Trainer at David\u2019s gym.\nEven though rather sickly throughout his life (and sad because of his inability to become a sportsman), he was transformed when he met a girl who overcame cancer to win a triathlon. \nThe lesson: excuses prevent our progress. Avoid people who encourage them.\nThe fourth teacher is the Bartender.\nHe teaches David that \u201cthe people around us affect everything. Our friends determine our fate.\u201d\nIn other words, that \u201cwho you are around determines where you go.\u201d\nSo, he concludes, \u201creplace naysayers, doubters and energy drainers with encouragers, winners and motivators.\u201d\nThat is the only road to success.\nThe fifth teacher is the Bookseller.\nShe tells David that one of the worst things about life is being imprisoned in your comfort zone.\n\u201cWinners seek out the uncomfortable,\u201d she says. \u201cLeaders consistently push beyond what\u2019s comfortable to stretch to new levels of achievement.\u201d\nIn fact, she adds rather ominously, \u201cmediocrity is the end result of too much comfort.\u201d\nThe sixth teacher is the Entrepreneur.\nHe teaches David that his thoughts don\u2019t control his destiny and that he shouldn\u2019t allow his current circumstances to define his destiny.\nHe reiterates the notion that \u201cexcuses are the weeds that try to choke progress\u201d and adds that \u201csuccessful people see temporary failures as stepping-stones to success.\u201d\nThe seventh teacher is the Conductor who teaches David how his best students stand out.\n\u201cStanding out,\u201d he says, \u201cis as simple as consistently outperforming expectations.\u201d\nThe tragedy is that \u201cmost of us spend our lives learning to blend in when success is about standing out.\u201d\nStanding out is the same as being true to yourself and authentic.\nIt is the same as being in touch with your unique giftedness.\nThe eighth teacher is the Artist.\nAfter David tells her that he doesn\u2019t have a painting bone in his body, she reveals to him that \u201cthe world has unlimited opportunity.\u201d\nIn other words \u2013 the problem is not with his painting capabilities, but with his mind, which constricts his potential.\nThere is no limit to it. \n\u201cThe only limitations you need to worry about are the ones in your mind,\u201d she concludes.\nThe final teacher is the Doctor and a few of his patients.\nThey teach David the one last final mistake all of us make: believing that we have all the time in the world.\nKnowing your life is limited is the only thing that will keep you focused on the most important part of your purpose.\nSuccessful people \u2013 learns David \u2013 have a sense of urgency.\nThe 3 Laws You Should Never Break\nWhile David is talking to the Doctor, a visitor knocks at his door.\n\u201cOh, you already have a visitor,\u201d she says. \u201cShould I come back later?\u201d\nDavid looks at her face and realizes that the girl is none other than the one he almost tripped over before the beginning of his journey.\nHer name: Aria, a name that has lingered in her family for a few hundred years.\nAnd that links the storyline of David in the present to the one of Aria\u2019s identically named ancestor Aria in the 1770s, when she reveals the three laws of success.\nYou should remember each of them, so let\u2019s quote them in full.\nEach of the words below is taken from the author, Skip Prichard.\nIf you\u2019ve followed the storylines closely, you\u2019ll already guess why. \nBecause the ancient Book is actually \n.\n\u201cThe Law of Desire is the first law. Desire is a spring overflowing to fill your life with goodness. All opportunity, all achievement, all power is activated first with a burning desire.\nDesire the noble; think high thoughts; feast on the abundance of possibility. Guard against wasting your desire on the insignificant and small.\nOnly when your desire is great enough does it activate the winds of achievement to propel you to the impossible. Do not proceed without picturing your desires achieved fully. Your desire sets the course of your destiny.\nDesire prevents others from limiting or labeling you unfairly. Desire pushes your thoughts to a new level, one higher than you think is possible. Let your desire burn within to fuel your success.\u201d\n\u201cThe Law of Gratitude is the second law. Gratitude is the fertilizer for the bounty of success, the enabler of the harvest. A grateful spirit magnetizes people, ideas, and opportunity.\nWith a grateful heart, one is able to receive blessings that pass over those who are bitter. Uplifted hands of gratitude have no expectation and yet are filled joyfully with abundance.\nInside a thankful person is love and an overflow of joy. One may unlock the mystery inside with a continually thankful attitude. Those who drink richly from the cup of thankfulness find themselves refreshed and their cup refilled. Count your daily blessings until your years are rich.\nOn its wings, gratitude lifts those in despair onto winds of plenty to fly above life\u2019s pains into the everlasting place of abundance. Speak gratitude to others and you fuel the mysterious power of the spirit.\u201d\n\u201cThe Law of Belief is the third and final law. The Almighty created you with purpose. Believe in yourself. What seems impossible and implausible is only the enemy of your potential.\nDevelop an unshakeable, unwavering, unbendable faith in your ability. Your destiny will expand as your belief expands. There are really no limits to what is possible for you.\nAllow your beliefs to soar like an eagle. You cannot rise higher than your own beliefs. Most importantly, when you are able, help instill belief in others. This is the most important task of all\u2014for once belief multiplies, nothing shall be impossible.\u201d\nThe 9 Secrets to Creating a Successful Future\nUnsurprisingly, the 9 secrets of success are the opposite of the 9 mistakes of failure.\nIn order, they are the following ones:\n1. Live your own dream.\n2. Recognize your inherent value.\n3. Reject excuses.\n4. Surround yourself with the right people.\n5. Explore outside your comfort zone.\n6. Move forward through challenges with determination and purpose.\n7. Stand out.\n8. Act boldly with the knowledge that your potential for success is unlimited.\n9. Pursue your goals with urgency\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Book of Mistakes Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\n is a delightful read.\nDue to the simple literary style and the parallel mystery-laden storylines, you\u2019ll barely notice that you\u2019ve learned some of the most important lessons on success and you will have already finished the book.\nSo, even if you think that some of the lessons are trite, at least you\u2019ll enjoy the stories.\nAnd if some of these lessons work for you \u2013 even better!\nYou have nothing to lose."},

And Why?\nWhether you are a plumber or a stockbroker, this book will positively speak to you. \nIt teaches the young generation how to overcome the struggle to find decent work in an overly ambitious and combative workforce. It also helps you understand finances, and why \u201cA\u201d students fall behind the \u201cC\u201d students. \nWith that said, we believe that \u201c\n\u201d is recommended for the wider audience.\nAbout Robert T. Kiyosaki\n is an American businessman and an author who has shed light on why having the best grades is not sufficient for success. \nHe is the author of:\n\u201cWhy \u201cA\u201d Students Work For \u201cC\u201d Students PDF Summary\u201d\nSchool and education overall, sometimes fail to recognize the potential in some kids, case in point, Albert Einstein and Thomas Edison. \nThey were both labeled as insubordinate, headstrong, clumsy, and mixed up. \nNonetheless, they came out of the woodwork years later and revolutionized the world with their great inventions.\nSo the question is:\nHow come the \u201cC\u201d students overshadow the \u201cA\u201d students in real life? \u2013 They learn what \u201cA\u201d students regard as irrelevant.\nIn the 2012 Presidential Election, Obama vs. Mitt Romney, you can clearly see why finances taught at home matter so much. Obama revealed that he paid 20% on his $3million income, while Romney paid 14% on his $21 million. \nMany were infuriated, but it clearly can be attributed to the dexterity in finance, and lessons taught at home. \nThe lesson is \u2013 give your kids a head start by teaching them how to manage their finance to prevent them from squandering the hard-earned dollar.\nUpon the mortgage market collapse in 2007, many young adults with college degrees had literally zero chance to find the high-paying six-figure job of their dreams. Driven by fear, parents began to caution their children of what would happen, if they didn\u2019t attend classes and enroll in a University.\nMeanwhile, education became even more expensive, and thousands of students were swimming in debt upon graduation.\nFor the first time in history, American people questioned the education system and firmly believe that the next generation won\u2019t do better. \u00a0\nWhy do we keep pressuring our kids to get a degree, when jobs are moving to low-wage countries? Why would anyone hire an American accountant, when you can simply outsource the work and get a much lower price? \u2013 It\u2019s pretty simple to understand why the American dream is shattered. \nAlso, why financial education is not taught at school? \nRobert asserts that education is key, but he harbors suspicions about the learning curve which seems to decline with each generation. \nThe \u201c\n\u201d slogan is starting to make less sense than ever. When Robert was just a boy, he would occasionally skip the chores to play Monopoly for hours after school. His dad would then come along, and tell him to stop wasting his time. \nRobert Kiyosaki\u2019s dad was a socialist (or at least leaning toward socialism); the average paycheck guy should you prefer.\nBetween the age of 9-18, he would go to the Rich Dad house and learn the process of running a business firsthand. He understood the true meaning of capitalism, and how we all benefit from other people\u2019s skills and talents. \nThe endless stream of knowledge he received from being involved in the real deal from an early age, gave him the edge in real life. \nThe Poor Dad (his father) wanted the safe path instigated through college, salary, security, pension, medical benefits, etc. \nNow you understand why so many people are graduating from college. The standards are lowered to the degree that almost any young kid who has no clue about his future can just sign the papers without understanding the financial burden of such actions. \nYou cannot help but notice that parents, and people in general, try to protect their children from the harsh reality of today. As the world progresses, new expenses and liabilities will incur, leading to even greater uncertainty. \nHence, many kids straight out of college cannot seem to fit in this workforce. \nThis leads to a backlash and the rise of a phenomenon known as \u201c\n.\u201d These are the kids who cannot survive on their own and are reliant upon their aging parents to take care of them. \n \u2013 Employees represent the majority of the workforce, and are mainly those who strive for higher paychecks.\n \u2013 A large chunk of the people here are the \u201cA\u201d students such as doctors, lawyers, etc.\n \u2013 The innovators, the business creators such as \n, Bill Gates, etc.\n \u2013 Active investors such as \n.\nYour mom and dad want you to fall into \u201cE\u201d or \u201cS\u201d quadrants, because it\u2019s much safer, while the Rich Dad prepares you to take over the \u201cI\u201d Or \u201cB\u201d quadrant. \nSocialists live in \u201cE & S\u201d quadrants, while capitalists live in \u201cI & B.\u201d Whenever people shout \u201c\n\u201d they don\u2019t understand that the taxes are raised on high-earners, which means people from \u201cE & S\u201d quadrants. \nInvestors and smart entrepreneurs prefer to remain capitalists who create jobs and value effort. It\u2019s not too sketchy for them to find legal ways to pay less taxes. It\u2019s simply a matter of finances not a matter of policies.\nIf you are keen to prepare your child for the battle lying up ahead, you have to make sure that you\u2019re teaching them how to spend wisely and avoid unnecessary costs. \nIn all honesty, it\u2019s never too late to change quadrants and start thinking critically. \nRich dad would say: \n, while Poor Dad dreads the idea of having money problems. You have to understand that long gone are the days when a person would get a job and spend 40-45 years in a single company only to retire and accrue various benefits. \nThe main bridge between wealthiness and poorness is how we handle the money problems.\nIn addition, let\u2019s take a look at the windows of learning that Robert holds in high regard!\nDuring this period, you\u2019ll see whether the system comprised of both parents and schooling has taught you well. \nRich Dad places emphasis on assets, while Poor Dad on liabilities. \nYou have to know where you draw the line by singling out the things which put money into your pocket and eliminating the ones that squeeze every bit of money that you earn.\n \u201cBs\u201d & \u201cIs\u201d focus on asset acquisition, unlike \u201cEs\u201d and \u201cSs\u201d who are not prone to think critically. \nAccording to Albert Einstein Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. \nTraditional education prioritizes content, not context. Context (person) holds the true meaning, and without it, content would not exist. \nIt\u2019s about the traits and habits these people endorse, espouse and promote:\nA Poor Person might say:\nMiddle-Class Person might say:\nRich Person or \u201cRich in the making\u201d might say:\nWhy the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer? \u2013 The solution is in the three income solution:\nJust utilizing the \u201cordinary\u201d method will get you nowhere. As an example, take a look at successful athletes and lottery winners, who failed to transform their income and ended up broke. Giving money to a poor person is not a guarantee for success, it\u2019s quite the opposite because they don\u2019t know how to manage finances.\nWhy put \u201cA\u201d students in this category and, why do \u201cA\u201d students fail? \nWell, mostly due to the fact that the school system only recognizes one intelligence. \nIn addition, let\u2019s list a few to get an aerial view of the problem:\nLast but not least, don\u2019t make snap judgments and believe that geniuses are greedy. That\u2019s probably the most misleading information about capitalists, who upon receiving strong financial education are more than willing to share their fortune in numerous ways.\nRemember, the American Dream is not something you have the right to demand, but something you have the right to pursue. \nKey Lessons from \u201cWhy \u201cA\u201d Students Work For \u201cC\u201d Students\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s never too late\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keep pushing, keep learning practically\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fill the shoes of a great leader\nIt\u2019s never too late\nYou might be a person in your late 30s or 40s, but that doesn\u2019t stand to reason as to why you wouldn\u2019t be a good candidate to shift your mindset. \nMany entrepreneurs unanimously argue that entrepreneurship embodied into capitalism is a mindset, not a profession. \nSo, don\u2019t feel discouraged to seize the world!\nKeep pushing, keep learning practically\nYes, reading is essential but not as important as participating in debates, doing actual things and experimenting. \nDon\u2019t be deceived by the notion that once you arrive at the office, you\u2019ll have all the skills because you\u2019ve been to the best schools.\nIt\u2019s just nonsense!

And Why?\nAbout\u00a0\n\u201cThe Facebook Effect PDF Summary\u201d\nFacebook started with a simple need, an insight that Zuckerberg figured out quickly and built on it. The Harvard students wanted to have an online directory so that they can find out relevant information about each other. Zuckerberg just realized that an online directory with information uploaded by the users would solve this need. And he built The Facebook.\nBut before that, and even after, Zuckerberg had been working on several other social networks, such as Facemash or Wirehog.\nHe felt social networks were the future, but he didn\u2019t know how far this could go. It was not only the favorable context of the Internet evolution and his age, but also his gut feeling and hard work.\nWhat most mattered to the success of Facebook was Zuckerberg\u2019s vision along the way. He was never interested in making money, instead, he kept thinking about the most efficient way for people to stay in touch and share relevant information.\nThis was translated into a very important principle for Facebook \u2013 a genuine identity. This fact ensured that each person would upload real information on the profile page.\nHaving a real identity made it easy for friends to find you and you had no interest to upload fake information about yourself. This is what actually made Facebook so popular, the users\u2019 confidence in the distribution of their data.\nZuckerberg\u2019s vision of making people interact with each other and not with the website made Facebook simple and easy to use.\nIt simply expanded to other colleges and then high schools and eventually to anybody. It soon became international and within 5 years it became the most important social network.\nAt some point, Zuckerberg knew that if Facebook became mainstream, it would change the world the same way the telephone or the telegraph had done.\nAnother key factor in the Facebook\u2019s success is represented by the people around Mark Zuckerberg.\nHe started everything with his dorm roommates who became his closest consultants and friends, but later on he hired people with experience in similar start-ups or big companies such as Microsoft, Yahoo or Google.\nEven if he had quit college in order to grow Facebook, he always looked for valuable persons to join him. The people who worked with helped him to make the right decisions in key moments of the company\u2019s history. At the same time, he always looked for young, smart people. He believed that they were more open and transparent \u2013 two core values of the company.\nEven though Facebook was getting more and more successful, Mark Zuckerberg kept thinking ahead and added new features. So, now you can also find on Facebook features like: News Feed, Facebook Ads or Sponsored Stories.\nAs he never wanted intrusive advertising that would interfere with the user\u2019s experience, he kept working to redefine ads until he met his objective.\nThe entire advertising world was redefined as Facebook became stronger. The consumers were the ones who are creating the content instead of the marketers. And a product or service recommended by a friend was much more valuable than any ad.\nFacebook did make history as Zuckerberg wanted because it was designed from the first place for the people and not for the money.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Facebook Effect\u201d\nVision, openness, and professionalism\nA platform which changed the world\nPopular among young adults\nWhat a turn of events for Mark!\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free \n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Facebook Effect Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review"},

And Why?\nApparently, writing \u201c\n\u201d has created an option for closing down that organizational \u201cpitfall\u201d. The problem refers to the inability to properly conduct the process of sharing the amount of work in the company. Transport everything that is from your head into a reliable system which the users can review on a regular basis.\nCorporations hate being forced to operate on the verge of uncertainty, meaning that the tasks delivered by their employees are not necessary \u2013 at least not in the present moment. Associates allow themselves to manipulate the system by finishing their work without communication.\nSuch mistakes can cause serious production issues and other managerial constraints. Once the activities are into the system, there is nothing to worry about, but aversiveness to change can sometimes play a considerable role.\nUse the designated folders, baskets and boxes to lock-up all of your items. At the same time, horizontal controls will grant you the possibility to put anything of value into an organized framework, and the vertical controls can enable you to plan any projects.\nProjects tend to get a little needy, once the implementation process is underway, to make it easy for you and the other associates, define the project\u2019s scope, vision and adopt a set of principles.\nThis book is intended to answer questions and enable organizations to master the technique of \u201c\n,\u201d as such all the people will find use in adopting some of the author\u2019s methods and understanding its vision.\nAbout David Allen\nwas born soon after the end of WW2 on December 28, 1945. He as an American-born consultant, writer, editor, and historian left a mark in every industry related to his expertise. With more than two decades of coaching experience, he indeed is an \u201call-arounder\u201d.\nDavid spent his childhood in Shreveport, Louisiana and graduated from the University of Berkeley \u2013 studying American history. Later on, he founded \u201cDavid Allen Company\u201d and time management \u201cGetting Things Done\u201d.\n\u201cGetting Things Done Summary\u201d\nI recently finished reading this book and I already started implementing a lot of the things I learned from it. It initially appeared in 2002 and it was revised in 2015 with some new ideas and perspectives, mostly from a technological point of view.\nDavid Allen is a productivity consultant for companies and individuals who\u00a0feel that somewhere along the road, they got lost in the little things and are trapped in a vicious circle of \n that consume their energy.\nThey know they have big projects, but they are not quite sure how to get started because it seems that there is always something in the way. Although many theories would suggest starting from the top down, and seeing the big picture when it comes to a project,\nAllen \n completely. In this new method, GTD (Getting Things Done) he says it is crucial to see \u201cWhat the next action is?\u201d, write down all your ideas about that particular project and divide it into small actionable steps.\nThis is actually one of the main ideas of the book and the entire system:\nSo in order to have a clear vision about our ideas, projects, plans and even day to day activities it is best to put them on paper. Sounds simple, but so many of us don\u2019t use this system and we rely solely on our minds to remember stuff.\nAnd that is not a big issue. The main problem is that we remember stuff in the moments \n and we decrease our productivity:\nIs there anything more important than a sharp vision? The phrase \u201cput everything on paper\u201d has some meaning, and this book summary is going to try and bring that message closer to the readers.\nWhether we are talking about office, home, family, \n or even vacations, it does not matter.\nAll things deserve to be treated with respect, because at the end of the day \u2013 productivity defines the quality of life. All of these topics should be written down in specific places where you know you will revise them again and make progress.\nGetting Things Done resolves another issue: if you have an agenda where you write down everything in bulk, you will never really get to the bottom of things, and you will be overwhelmed by the amount of information that you gathered.\nSo one of the easiest ways to get organized is to use lists. Post-its, agendas, pens, paper, all the classic stuff that you\u00a0usually keep around the house or in our office can help you in this process.\nOf course, you can also use digital tools and rely on them to some extent, but it was proven that these traditional tools \n. How can you get started?\nAllen suggests that it takes about a full weekend for some of his clients to go thoroughly through the entire process and organize their lives. You would need two days in which you are not distracted, you do not have important calls, tasks, and commitments.\nYou will need to go through all your stuff and make a complete inventory of your materials. If they are useful for some projects, if they are just reading materials, stuff you will deal with at a later date or simply just trash.\nHe recommends this process not only for individuals but also for companies: \nIn order to be more productive, the author suggests using the two-minute rule.\nSo if something new \n like an email or a memo that you have to answer with yes or no, if it can be done in under two minutes, the advice is to do it, even if you feel that it breaks your work cycle.\nLeaving it for another time will mean that your emails are starting to gather in your inbox and perhaps answering after a week is no longer relevant to that topic.\nAnything that requires under 2-minute actions \n.\nIn order to be more focused and present in our daily activities, Allen says we need to have a \u201cMind like water\u201d:\nHow can you achieve a \u201cmind like water\u201d attitude? Well, first you have to take everything from your mind and write it down on a piece of paper.\nYou will instantly feel more relaxed because you now have a system which will help you remember things instead of constantly wandering \n there when you should be focusing on one project at a time.\nOnce you do this and you have control over what is in your head, you need to find the right perspective.\nHabemus GTD\nDavid Allen, in developing his famous method, called this \u201copen circuit\u201d effect, which he defines as \u201canything attracting our attention that is not in its proper place as it is.\u201d Complex things like \u201cputting an end to hunger in Africa\u201d or as small as \u201cputting an envelope in the mail\u201d.\nThe point of the book is that even people \n will always be more relaxed, focused and productive if they learn to deal with their open circuits efficiently.\nTo do this, he proposed a method, which he called GTD, or Getting Things Done (Free Translation, \u201cLeaving Things Done\u201d or \u201cCompleting Tasks\u201d). GTD is a system for controlling these open circuits so that you can focus on your current task at all times without distractions.\nAccording to David Allen, every open circuit in your life must have its own place, organized and filed, so you can temporarily take it out of your head, with the peace of mind that when you need to revisit it, it will be properly cataloged.\nAlso, GTD also features a task prioritization system to ensure that you are always working on the most important activity at the time. The system is broken in steps. Get to know them below:\nThe first step to adopting GTD is to bring together the tasks that are taking away your focus. You can use paper, a tool like Evernote or even an email client to do this (our favorite is Google\u2019s Inbox).\nThe tasks that you need to collect on this list will come from your day-to-day activities, but also from requests from co-workers, friends, and family. To succeed in this step, it is important that:\nEvery planned task should go to your collection system and thus get out of your head; This list needs to be constantly and cleanly revisited when you perform or cancel a task. Having this list is essential, and if a task is open in your head, it is important that you take note.\nOtherwise, it will end up becoming a distraction that takes your focus every moment.\nIt is impossible to finish all your tasks and close all your circuits. It is human nature that new open circuits always appear. But if you cannot do all the tasks you wrote down, how can you keep your list empty? For this, there is a simple but extremely efficient cleaning process that keeps you organized.\n\u00a0Identify the item: Before starting a new task, we must identify what is contained in it and make a careful analysis.\nAsk yourself \u201cWhat is this?\u201d And understand in depth what that task represents.\nThis is very important especially when tasks are demands that come from other people such as emails. \n what tasks need to be done to close the open circuit.\n\u00a0Ask yourself, \u201cDo I need to do something about it?\u201d\nThis question is interesting because not all tasks really need to be performed, after all, some demands may have no meaning, or it may be that you or someone on your team is not necessarily the best person to do it.\nIf you identify a task that you do not need to take action, do one of the following: Put it in the trash. Archive it as \u201cone day / maybe\u201d (this is for anything you may want to do in the future but cannot do or do not want to do now).\nArchive it as a \u201creference\u201d (you do not need to do anything about it, but you may need this information later; it\u2019s a good idea to have an organized system for storing reference items, either in your bookmark system, in an email folder Or even on paper on your desk).\n[PRO TIP: Use Evernote] If the task requires your attention, but not immediate, it is best to mark it as such. It is essential to put it on a list to be revisited in the future. A good idea would be to put an automatic reminder on your calendar for when action needs to be taken.\n[Pro Tip: Use Google Calendar or Google Inbox!] In the cases above, you have solved the item and can remove it from your collection system and thus close (although temporarily, in the case of future attention) the open circuit.\nMost items in your collection buckets probably will not go beyond this stage. This step is essential to ensure that we have our heads free to start producing and focusing on the tasks that require our immediate attention.\nIf your list only has tasks that require immediate attention, now is the time to go to the next step\n\u00a0Ask yourself, \u201cFrom my list, what is the next activity I should execute?\u201d \n you have to be smart in choosing what to focus on first. If it is a simple task, you can go straight to the next step.\nBut in our lives, many tasks are complex and require several small activities to \n.\nIf the task is simple, skip to the next step. If the task is more complex and will require it to be broken into several smaller tasks, you need to add it to a new list called Projects.\nIn the Projects list, you must break this item across all its sub-items. With the sub-items set, return the most important ones to your main list. The list of projects is a list of all open circuits that require more than one task to complete.\nA good example would be to have a \u201cRent apartment\u201d project, and its subtasks would be \u201cVisit real estate\u201d, \u201cChoose apartments to visit\u201d, \u201cVisit apartments\u201d, \u201cMake an offer to real estate\u201d.\nThe projects list is a tool for tracking the open circuits you are still working on.\nWhen you complete all the sub-tasks of a project, you can take it out of the project list. When new tasks appear in the project, such as \u201cFind cosigner for the contract\u201d, add it to the project list.\n\u00a0Work on small tasks. This step is to ask yourself, \u201cCan I complete this task in a single action and in less than two minutes?\u201d Simple tasks like the examples below can be executed immediately.\nAnswer a question from a co-worker; Fill out a short survey form; Schedule a meeting; And if you can complete it right away, why not finish it now and clear your brain of that open circuit?\n\u00a0Delegate what is not your job / It is not the best use of your time. After the immediate tasks, the easy and fast, it is time to know how to handle the tasks a little more complex, it is time to prioritize them.\nThe first question should be: Am I the best person to carry out this activity or \n (family, friends, etc.)? If it makes sense to delegate this activity, go ahead and do it.\nOnce you have delegated a task, you must schedule the date on which you want to check the progress of the task. If you choose to perform the task, put it on your list of upcoming actions. The list of upcoming actions is timely planning, which ideally should be closed early in the day so you can be productive and do the most you can.\n\u00a0Organizing your list of upcoming tasks. You should constantly revisit your list of upcoming tasks. The two most common ways of organizing it are by context and by priority.\nTo organize your list by context, ask yourself, \u201cWhere do I need to be to accomplish this task?\u201d\nContexts can be physical locations such as your office, your home or the supermarket, but they can also be specific situations, already pre-occupied daily or weekly in your schedule.\nA good example of situation context would be to have a fixed time in your agenda, from 8-am to 9-am called \u201cemail management\u201d, or \u201cinternal meetings.\u201d For each context, you must create a task list.\nOrganizing by context helps you, regardless of what you\u2019re doing, to look at your list of upcoming actions and see what you need to do where you are.\nPriority organization, however, must be done differently.\nIt is necessary to ask yourself, \u201cGiven my context, time and energy available, \n?\u201d\nAnother important point is to consider the tasks according to your long-term goals.\nAllen also suggests that you familiarize yourself with the Eisenhower Matrix of prioritization, which is based on the urgency and importance of the tasks (google this or read the article above!).\nNow that you\u2019ve created your list of upcoming actions and organized them by context and priority, you\u2019re ready to get started. Roll up your sleeves to perform the most complex and hairy tasks.\nStill, you\u2019ll have tasks popping up in your calendar (the ones you delegated and checked to check in Step 5), so plan to have time for them as well. If during an execution time some new task begins to distract \n, put it on your list of open circuits so that you can return to it later.\nThe last step is the constant review of our lists and there are three essential analyzes that should become a habit so that we can keep our circuits constantly in the tracks. Here they are:\nAllen\u2019s method suggests six \u201chorizons of focus\u201d:\nWhat is so great about this process is that there isn\u2019t a recipe for everyone and you can customize the process so that it fits your personality and your work mechanisms.\nYou can choose a number of lists that you want to have, the way to organize your calendar, the amount of technology you want to involve.\nYou have to take into consideration some basic guiding lines, but most of it can be tailored to your specific needs.\n is a mechanism that will help you store, track and retrieve information at any given moment and in this way you will no longer feel stressed that you might forget some important details.\nWhat you need to keep in mind \n, is the fact that it needs to be broken down into actions.\nFor example, if you just write: planning vacation, this is not something that will make you take further action. You need to think about the specific steps and what is the next 1-2 concrete steps that you need to take: a. decide about location, b. announce your boss that you need a vacation leave, c. book tickets etc.\n\u201cProject\u201d is a very general term and as the author puts it:\nIf you keep these suggestions in mind and you start even with only small changes, you will see the difference in the way you respond to tasks and the way you organize in a matter of days.\nThis book is one of the best I\u2019ve read when it comes to time/action \n and it really helped me to become a more focused and organized person.\nI began to apply the ideas presented while I was reading it and although I did not reach the point of having a full purge of my office and all my documents, I still feel better about the way I organize my day to day activities and I became more productive.\nKey Lessons from \u201cGetting Things Done\u201d\n1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Managing limited resources\n\n2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Look from another perspective\n\n3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Workflow Mastery\nManaging limited resources\nYou only have 24 hours each day, make the best out of that time. Well-equipped managers must be able to efficiently allocate expendable resources.\nIf you consider yourself as one, start by identifying only the most essential activities and avoid working on others. Define each project\u2019s steps and follow them thoroughly.\nLook from another perspective\nNot knowing whether the job is completed or not, is the worst case scenario. Adopting new attitude on how to get things done efficiently must be a priority for any company.\nBelieve in change, and train the other employees to follow your example.\nWorkflow Mastery\nDon\u2019t let life control you, beat the system and become your own master.\nThere are several stages, which will assist you in managing life by valuing all those things that are worthy of your attention and combining them into a well-organized framework of activities.\n\u201cGetting Things Done\u201d Quotes\nOur Critical Review\nThe book empowered by many core principles also describes in great detail all the tools that you have available in order to be more productive and keep an organized life.\nWe\u00a0join\u00a0the agenda by producing this book summary that is going to spread the \u201cGetting Things Done\u201d influence worldwide.

But he also gives us the tools we need most when this happens.\nBesides perception and action, the discipline of overcoming obstacles requires a last critical step \u2013 \nWe must understand \nas fortitude and wisdom. \n\u00a0WILL is the \n.\nThe will is what prepares us for a world that is inherently unpredictable and allows us to thrive and be happy in spite of it.

And Why?\nOn November 19 and November 22, 2010, Oprah Winfrey hosted the biggest Favorite Things show to date; on its second day, between Josh Groban\u2019s \nand a Talbott Teas holiday assortment she listed a book which was little-known by then: Mark Nepo\u2019s \nUnsurprisingly, this launched Nepo\u2019s 2000 book to the top of the \n bestseller list, where it stayed for a while.\nConsidering the fact that Oprah subsequently named Nepo one of the 100 most inspiring visionaries of today, it\u2019s only natural that all of Nepo\u2019s subsequent books have been both eagerly awaited and well received.\nis not an exception.\nCombining poetry, personal stories and spiritual lessons, this book is for anyone who wants to discover the innermost parts of his soul; and find a way to come to terms with them or elevate them to a higher plane of being.\nAbout Mark Nepo\n is an American poet, philosopher, and spiritual adviser, dubbed \u201ca consummate storyteller,\u201d \u201can eloquent spiritual teacher,\u201d and \u201cone of the finest spiritual guides of our time.\u201d\nAfter obtaining a doctorate in English, Nepo taught for almost two decades at the State University of New York in Albany, New York; afterward, he moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan where he still lives.\nIn 1987, Nepo was diagnosed with a rare form of lymphoma, a struggle which helped him form an idiosyncratic and syncretic spiritual philosophy which he has since shared in a number of books. \nThe most famous among them is \n, which though published in 2000 made it to the top of \nbestseller list a decade later, after being endorsed by Oprah who included Nepo in both her \nand the \n program.\nMany of Nepo\u2019s recent works have been included in \n\u2019s list of best spiritual books: \n (in the 2017 list), \n (in the 2015 list), \n(in the 2014), and \n(in the 2013 list).\nFind out more at \n. \n\u201cThe One Life We\u2019re Given PDF Summary\u201d\nOn his webpage, Mark Nepo notes that \n\u201caffirms how precious this one life is and opens the chance we have to be fully alive and to be of use to each other and the world.\u201d\nIn other words, it moves on from where \n left off, and it\u2019s unsurprising that it shares much the same short-chapter format of that book.\n\u201cA continuous inquiry in what it means to be human, to be here, and to care for one another,\u201d \nis divided into four thematic sections, each of which contains twenty or so few pages\u2019 long chapters.\nEach chapter contains an autobiographical story, a metaphor or some other type of example \u201cthat brings a question or quandary of living into view.\u201d\nNext, Nepo digs deeper and uncovers the lesson hidden beneath these stories.\nFinally, he offers a question, a meditation, or a type of conversation to have with a loved one.\nNepo calls these \u201cseeds of water along the way\u201d and invites you to keep a journal as you read, \u201cas an intimate space where you might hear your soul, as a sketchbook where your heart can personalize the themes\u201d explored by the book.\nSince there are so many of them, it is very difficult to summarize this book; if we have to use just one excerpt to do so, it will certainly be this one:\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe One Life We\u2019re Given\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Getting Closer to Life: Your Legacy and Your Personal Mythology\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Loving What You Do: Touch the Branches of Meaning\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finding What Can Last: Face the Serpent King\n4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Being Kind and Useful: Cultivating Wonder and Self-Awareness\nGetting Closer to Life: Your Legacy and Your Personal Mythology\nYour life is what is happening to you at this very moment; and yet, most of the people reading this sentence think that it\u2019s something about to begin, something in the distance.\nUnfortunately, it is usually the undesirable events in life which awake us to its mystery and beauty, to the fact that it is all around us and that we must get closer to it before it slips away.\nThree years before Mark Nepo published \n, his father, Morris Nepo, died at the age of 93.\nSitting beside him during the last months of his life, Mark started thinking about what his father had left behind him; and that called into his mind the fact that he is part of a lineage that goes way back to a Russian leatherworker, his great-grandfather.\n\u201cWhen in trouble,\u201d he would supposedly say \u2013 remembering the time he fell into a river after being chased by Cossacks who didn\u2019t kill him because they didn\u2019t want their horses to get cold \u2013 \u201cwait till you see a way out.\u201d\nMark\u2019s grandfather lived through the Great Depression in the US. \u201cBreak whatever we have in half,\u201d he\u2019d say to his wife when she\u2019d complain that they don\u2019t have enough. \u201cIt will be enough.\u201d\nAnd what sentence was Morris\u2019 legacy?\n\u201cGive me a minute, and I\u2019ll figure out what to do\u201d \u2013 the thing he\u2019d always say to his wife, no matter the hardship or the circumstance.\nAfter braiding their lessons into a rope he can use, now it\u2019s time for Mark to leave a legacy, a personal story his loved ones will further braid into the rope.\nAnd that rope, you see, that\u2019s the essence of a few personal myths; even the largest ones began the way this chapter does.\nLoving What You Do: Touch the Branches of Meaning\n\u201cRegardless of what you do for living,\u201d writes Mark Nepo in the first chapter of the second section of \n(\u201cBring Up the Lights\u201d), \u201cthe only important vocation is listening to the heart when it says: this is vital, this is alive, this can\u2019t be lost.\u201d\nMost of the things we have that help us go through life \u2013 \u201cevery book and form of art, every keepsake and treasure we pass from generation to generation, every story told\u201d \u2013 are this kind of cries of the heart.\nSomeone, somewhere, sometime thought that something mustn\u2019t be lost; and he made every attempt in his power to make sure that it won\u2019t. \n\u201cNo one knows how to live or how to die,\u201d writes Nepo. \u201cWe only know how to love and how to lose, and how to pick up branches of meaning along the way.\u201d\nThese are, in fact, the words a wise old woman tells to a widower who has lost all faith in life after the death of his wife. \nHe comes to her to ask for advice, and instead, the woman asks him to poke a branch through a running stream and feel the movement of the water.\n\u201cYou see,\u201d she says to him, \u201cthat you can feel the water without putting your hand in the water, this is what meaning feels like.\u201d\nThat\u2019s how we feel the presence of someone who is absent; and that\u2019s how meaning saves us.\nBy way of proxy \u2013 even when it\u2019s seen through the glass, darkly.\nFinding What Can Last: Face the Serpent King\nIn one of the chapters of the third section of \n, Mark Nepo talks about fear \u2013 and relates a story about his crippling fear of snakes.\nTwo decades before he published the book, Nepo noticed a large snake (about five feet long) in a crack of the front stoop of his house.\nIncapable of facing it, but fearing for the safety of his family, he did the first thing that came to his mind: he bought a liquid concrete and sealed the snake within the crack.\nHowever, a few hours later, he noticed that the snake had somehow managed to slither away.\nThere was no way out now: the only thing he was left to do was to kill it; so he did.\nHowever, after dumping the remains, the fear was not gone. \u201cI couldn\u2019t calm my heart,\u201d writes Nepo. \u201cI came close to vomiting several times, and wondered why it had never occurred to me to call someone to take the snake away. I\u2019d let my fear create a life for itself.\u201d\nThe story doesn\u2019t end there.\nTwenty years later, Mark \u2013 now with his new wife \u2013 took a walk and a small snake jumped in front of his feet; then another one; and then a third one.\nMark Nepo realized in a second what was happening: it was his karma, coming back to haunt him for needlessly taking away the life of another sentient being.\nHe concludes:\nBeing Kind and Useful: Cultivating Wonder and Self-Awareness\nOne of the chapters in the final section of his book, Nepo begins with a quote by George Bernard Shaw: \u201cthe only man I know who behaves sensibly is my tailor; he takes my measurements anew each time he sees me. The rest go on with their old measurements and expect me to fit them.\u201d\nThis is the work of self-awareness, says Nepo: to be our own tailor, to take those measurements (whether ours or someone else\u2019s) anew, over and over again.\nFor these are the eyes of the child, the ones which see everything as if they have never seen it before; the ones which seem to always say: \u201cOh, my God, look at that magnificent something!\u201d\nThese are, of course, the eyes everyone should have, filled with wonder and astonishment:\nNepo writes:\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe One Life We\u2019re Given Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\n\u201cI would follow this man anywhere his words want to take us,\u201d wrote Elizabeth Gilbert, the author of \n and \n, in praise of Mark Nepo and \n. \u201cHis voice helps us find pathways where we might have believed that no pathway could possibly exist.\u201d\nReverend Ed Bacon went even a step further: \u201cMark Nepo is one of our national treasures,\u201d he states. \u201cThat is because Mark inhabits that rare and beautiful consciousness that enables him to express the language of the soul. The words and energy flowing from the font of his heart not only make our lives more beautiful but heal us.\u201d\n\u201cA powerful guide to being in the world without being overwhelmed by it,\u201d \nincludes many \u201cprofound and poignant stories and insights\u201d which can help you survive what life brings you, and to thrive inwardly (\n).No wonder it was named one of the Best Spiritual Books of 2016 by \n. \u201cThe wisdom presented in the shining pages of this holy book,\u201d \n, \u201cis another luminous gift from a gallant, grateful, and imaginative spiritual master.\u201d \n\n"},
{"title": "The 4-Hour Body Summary", "url": "https://blog.12min.com/the-4-hour-body-summary/", "cover": null, "content": "17 min read \u231a\u00a0\n: \nThe book starts from the premise that small changes can produce great results.\nIf you want to learn how to efficiently stay in shape and without hunger, how to have good nights of sleep, run better and even how to improve your sex life, this is the ideal book for you.\nYou do not have to have good genetics or count on luck to do it! Author Tim Ferriss explains how to get better results from the least effort with simplicity. Let\u2019s go on this adventure for health and well-being?\nThe 4-Hour Body Summary\nThe rules of weight loss always say that some things are impossible: you cannot lose more than 1kg per week; You can not change your muscle type; the only way to lose weight is by cutting calories.\nThe Foundations Of The\u00a04-Hour Body Plan (4HB)\nYou have heard all these things and tried to be healthier, but the reality is these rules are not as accurate as most think.\nYou can do some things differently, small changes that will allow you to reach your ideal weight.\nThe purpose of 4HB is to show what you can change in your life to improve your health regarding weight loss, sleep \n, physical stamina, and overall longevity.\nTim tells the story of Arthur Jones. He was one of the most influential people in the field of physical education.\nJones did a lot of research and experimentation and left a substantial legacy. One such legacy was the idea of an Effective Minimum Dose (EMD).\nThe EMD is the least amount of something that will produce the desired result.\nFor example, the minimum amount of exercise you need to do to see results is the exercise EMD for you. If you overdo your EMD in any situation, you can interrupt your progress and hinder your efforts.\nIf you think about reinventing your life, especially with regards to your physical appearance, removing stored fat and gaining muscle are two essential elements.\nWhen it comes to stored fat, you need to find out your EMD to activate fat burning hormones.\nTo gain muscle, you need to find out your EMD which activates muscle growth and the hormone responsible for it.\nExperiments show that losing weight is not as simple as just counting calories.\nCalories should not be your focus to achieve weight loss. In fact, calories are only considered significant because they are measurable and monitorable in tests. The 4HB plan will not make you count and cut calories to lose fat.\nYour motivation needs to be large enough that you not only start the process but also stick to it. You need to monitor your progress by always measuring your results to keep you on track.\nMeasuring And Accompanying The Results\nWhen you start following the 4HB plan, you will lose body fat and gain muscle.\nYou will begin to notice a substantial difference in your weight in the first few months. You may also notice that your weight loss will begin to get less dramatic after the initial three months.\nWhile you lose fat, you are gaining muscle as well. Muscle gain appears on the scale, so even though you are still losing fat, it will not appear because of the muscles you gain in the process.\nYou cannot let the numbers on the scale hinder your progress.\nIf you are the type of person who needs to see measurable results in terms of \n, there are some tests you can do to determine the fat percentage.\nWhen you begin the plan, write down your measurements so that you see your progress throughout.\nBegin by measuring your circumference. Use a tape measure, note the size of your upper arms (middle biceps), your waist, your hip at the widest point and both of your legs.\nAdd these measures to determine your overall measures. Next, estimate your percentage of body fat based on your body shape.\nEliminating Fat\nWhen you are following the 4HB plan, your diet will be low-carb. If you follow the diet correctly, you can lose up to 10kg of fat in a month.\nThe first rule of dieting is to avoid white carbs. These foods are banned during the diet, except thirty minutes after a high-strength workout.\nThat means you\u2019ll need to cut out all bread, rice, cereal, potatoes, pasta, and fried breaded foods. That includes whole foods as well.\nThe second rule is to have repeat meals. You can mix the foods in your meals, but you should eat the same foods in your meals. These are the foods allowed:\nYou can eat as much as you want from the above foods. You also need to make sure you have enough vegetables to maintain your caloric intake while you are on a diet, as vegetables do not have many calories.\nMake three to four meals and repeat them every day. If you are going to eat in a restaurant, or anywhere but your house, ask to replace the starch with more vegetables.\nYou can also eat other vegetables that are not listed above; Just stay away from potatoes.\nYou may have noticed that there is no milk on this list. Milk is forbidden as it causes a high insulin response in the body. The only dairy product that is allowed is cottage cheese since it is high in protein.\nButter is also allowed as long as it is pure butter and has only butter and salt in its ingredients list.\nt. You need to make your first meal of the day the first hour you wake up. From there, your meals should have a 4 hours gap.\nIf you NEED to snack between meals, carrots are the best thing to eat but do not eat too many. If you have noticed that you are getting hungry between meals, you are not eating enough and you should increase your portions.\nThe third rule is to stay away from liquid calories. You can drink as much water as you want, unsweetened tea, black coffee or other non-calorie beverages. You cannot drink milk, soda or fruit juices.\nYou can drink soda diets, but need to limit yourself to 400ml per day. Alcoholic beverages should be avoided. However, you can take two glasses of red wine a day.\nThe fourth rule is to stop eating fruits. That may seem strange, but the reality is that you do not need to eat fruits to be healthy. The only fruits allowed in the diet are tomatoes and avocado. Avocado should be limited to one unit per day.\nThe fifth and final rule is to take a day off per week in which you can eat anything you want in any amount. That is not just to help you not give up; There are also benefits of weight loss.\nWhen you increase your calorie intake dramatically, you will actually help your fat loss by ensuring that your metabolic rate does not get slow because of the long periods of calorie restriction.\nYou will notice that you have gained weight after your day off but as long as you follow the plan on all other days, you will lose that weight within the next 48 hours.\nBeyond the diet, you can take supplements like potassium, magnesium, and calcium. You can also use different seasonings and sauces in your meals.\nPepper paste, unsweetened sweeteners, olive oil, macadamia oil, and grapeseed oil may also be used.\nThe above five rules are the basis of the 4HB meal plan. Here are two other factors that will contribute to your fat loss and muscle gain:\nNutraceuticals are supplements that you can add to the diet to give you more energy, improve your immune system, \u00a0cholesterol, and other benefits. PAGG is a nutraceutical that can help you in your weight loss and muscle gain.\nThis supplement consists of 20 or 25 milligrams of policosanol, which is a plant extract to lower cholesterol, 100 to 130 milligrams of alpha lipoic acid, an antioxidant that will prevent your body from storing carbohydrates in fat cells, 325 milligrams of green tea flavanols also known as EGCG and at least 200 milligrams of garlic extract, which prevents fat recovery, and coats cholesterol.\nIt is recommended that you take this supplement before each meal and before bed. You should take it six days a week and stop taking it for a week every two months.\nWhile using this supplement, make sure you maintain your optimal levels of B-complex vitamins.\nConsult a doctor if you have any health problem or taking any medicine, especially anticoagulants. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, do not take PAGG.\n\u00a0Scientific research has found that the body burns more energy when subjected to cold temperatures.\nOne option is to put an ice pack in your upper trapezius muscle area or behind the neck for about twenty minutes every morning. A second option is to drink at least 500 ml of ice water as soon as you wake up, before eating anything else.\nYou should then have breakfast no more than half an hour later. The third option is to take icy baths for 5 to 10 minutes in the morning or before bed.\nThe fourth option is the most extreme: you will need to sit in an ice bath for 20 minutes.\nCold baths have numerous benefits, including the release of fatty acids, an increase in adiponectin, stimulation of thermogenesis, improvement of your immune system and an \nGetting Stronger And Building Muscles\nThe next step is to learn how to gain muscle, which will help keep the fat away and make you feel better. For this, we present some exercises that you can do:\n\u00a0balancing with kettlebell done with two hands is one of the best exercises you can do to gain muscle. It is, in fact, the only exercise you need to produce drastic changes.\nTo properly balance the kettlebell, stand with your feet at a distance of approximately 30 cm (12 in) from each other, and with your fingers pointed slightly outward.\nKeep your shoulders back, start swinging backward with the kettlebell while making a movement as if you would sit in a chair.\nHold your shoulders back and push your hips forward as you squeeze your buttocks. As you move forward, the thrust and weight of the kettlebell will push your arms, creating a swing.\n\u00a0These exercises are designed to help you get in shape and improve your posture quickly and easily.\nExercise A\nMake 10 sets each with thirteen reps and as much weight as you can, except for swings with the kettlebell. For the kettlebell, make 20 to 25 swings. Repeat the entire circuit twice.\nThis series has different repetitions for each exercise, but the whole circuit must be repeated twice.\n\u00a0The abdominals are probably the most coveted muscle group, especially for men. Here are two moves you can do to set your abdominal muscles.\nThe myotatic abdomens use their fully extended positioning and their stretch reflex to create a strong contraction. To perform these sit-ups, you need a Bosu, a Swiss ball or a pile of firm cushions.\nYou want to position yourself on the ball or on the cushions by sitting as close to the ground as possible.\nBegin with your arms stretched over your head as high as possible; Keep your arms behind or close to your ears throughout the exercise.\nThen lower yourself slowly for four seconds until your fingers touch the ground, all the while trying to keep your hands off the ball. Stop at this position for two seconds, attempting the maximum elongation.\nClimb up slowly and stop at the top, in full contraction position for another two seconds. Do a total of 10 reps.\nAfter completing them, add weight to your hands, but women should not exceed 5 kg in weight.\nThe \u201ccat vomit\u201d exercise will contract your abdomen inward. Instead of working the vertical muscles in your abdomen like the myotatic abdominal, this exercise works the horizontal muscles known as transverse abdominal muscles (TAM).\nTo do this, stay on all fours and keep your eyes focused directly on your head or slightly forward. Do not arch your back or strain your neck.\nThen exhale through your mouth until all air is expelled.\nYour abdomen should contract with this forced movement. Hold your breath and contract the navel upward toward the spine as much as you can, aiming for 8 to 12 seconds. Take a deep breath through your nose after holding your breath.\nDo a breathing cycle as rest and then do 10 repetitions of this exercise\nWhen it comes to the 4HB plan exercises, it is important to remember that extrapolating your EMD is risky and pointless.\nImproving Your Sex Life\nThe 4HB plan is not just about your weight and your muscles. The purpose of the plan is to reinvent your life so that you become a better person overall. For this reason, improving your sexual performance is important.\nSome women say they have never had an orgasm while others say \n.\nThe goal here is for you to have an orgasm through manual stimulation or intercourse, or for you to be able to give a woman an orgasm through these methods.\nA woman first needs to feel comfortable with her own sexuality and what she likes in bed. If a woman does not masturbate regularly, it will be difficult to facilitate orgasm.\nIf you are one of these women, you should start exploring your body for five minutes before bed or when you wake up. You will not be able to enjoy orgasm as a partner until you can enjoy one on your own.\nRegarding positions that increase pleasure and induce orgasm, the penetration angle is important.\nBy changing the angle at which the penis penetrates the vagina, you can ensure that the head of the penis contacts the female G-spot, which lies 2.5 to 5cm \n, at the top.\nIf a man inserts his index finger to the second joint (palm up) and makes a move up and back, as if he were calling someone, the fingertip should touch a spongy tissue.\nThat is the G spot. Change the penetration angle so that the penis head has a better chance of coming into contact with that area.\nSimilarly, you can change the applied pressure during sex to facilitate female orgasms. Increasing the force will allow the male pelvic bone to be in direct contact with the clitoris. That will lead to increased pleasure for the woman. Here are some positions that facilitate female orgasm:\nThis contact should last for exactly 15 minutes. Man, start by separating the lips and hold the clitoris with the right thumb, keeping the prepuce of clitoris upwards.\nPlace your left hand under her butt, two fingers under each buttock, with the thumb at the base of the vagina.\nThis will work as a support and help the woman relax. Imagine that you are looking directly at the clitoris in the middle of her legs, with the top of the clitoris at the 12 o\u2019clock position.\nFind the position 1 hour \u2013 ideally a small flap or pocket between the hood and the clitoris \u2013 with the index finger on your right hand and start stroking using the lightest possible touch, with a movement around the region of about 1.5 mm\nUse a consistent speed for two or three minutes before varying the speed.\nThat will cause her to orgasm.\n\u00a0Testosterone is the male sex hormone produced in the testicles. Some men have low amounts of testosterone for many reasons.\nThat is usually treated with medicines, but it need not be so. There are two different methods for you to improve your testosterone levels without medications.\nThe first is for your long-term testosterone levels. Take two capsules of cod liver oil with butterfat rich in vitamins. Take 3,000 to 5,000 IU of vitamin D when you wake up and before bedtime (until you reach blood levels of 55ng / ml.)\nTake short 10-minute ice baths when you wake up and before bedtime. You can also eat three nuts when you wake up and before bed.\nThe second method is for the short term. Consume at least 800 milligrams of cholesterol three hours before bed the night before sex.\nThat works because testosterone is derived from cholesterol, \n. Also, eat four horse nuts, 20 raw almonds and two capsules of cod liver oil and butter, four hours before sex.\nImproving Your Performance In Physical Activities\nThe next step is to reinvent yourself, focusing on improving your performance in physical activities.\n\u00a0To improve your vertical jump, you should do the workouts prepared by NFL coach Joe DeFranco.\nBegin by making ten conventional jumping jacks, ten with forward arms, five steps backwards on each side of your body, five steps to the side on each side, ten full leg swings, and twenty seconds of jump rope, landing on the front part of your feet and straight legs, as fast as possible.\nOnce you complete these exercises, you can measure your vertical jump base distance and save your results.\nTo improve the initial average, you must first change the way you jump. You need to use your shoulders and upper body strength to pull back.\nYou should also leave your arms at the highest point without pulling them back. Narrowing your squatting position can also help you improve your heel.\nThe tension in the hip flexor muscles can also be a problem to improve vertical jumping. Stretch your flexor muscles using static stretching 30 seconds before your jump; Hold the position for 30 seconds.\n\u00a0Start with a warm-up: jump rope for 18 meters (60 feet) twice, six reps backward on both sides of the body, 18 meters backpedaling twice, 18 meters semi-squatting with a lateral pass.\nContinue the procedure with stretching and muscle activation: 10 roll-overs with legs apart, 10 hip circles on the move 4 pads and 10 alternating pads.\nThese exercises should be followed by \n: 20 seconds of jump with plantar flexion and two sessions of 5 seconds of normal squatting with jumping.\nTo start improving your speed, correct your starting position. Place your right hand down and your left leg forward. Keep your left foot about 30cm behind the finish line, then touch your right toes at the back of your left heel.\nBend and bring your right hand in front of the line with your index finger, middle finger and thumb together. Bend your right arm at a 90-degree angle.\nBoost and look at the first step with your back leg to land almost 1m ( 3ft) from the toes of your front foot. When running, keep your chin down and do not look up.\nImproving Your Sleep\nIf it takes a long time to fall asleep, this is considered early insomnia. If you wake up several times during the night, this is called intermediate insomnia.\nIf you wake up too soon and cannot go back to sleep, you have terminal insomnia.\nBecause it is very hard for someone to assess their own sleep quality and understand what is actually happening, it may be necessary to have some outside help, such as using a sleep monitor with a variety of functions.\nSome important points about having a good night of sleep are:\n\u00a0Whether or not you get a good night\u2019s sleep for eight or ten hours depends on the relationship between your REM sleep and your total sleep.\nIf you have high percentages of REM sleep, you feel more rested. You can increase your REM percentage by waking up for five minutes approximately four and a half hours after sleeping.\nYou can also increase your REM sleep percentage by taking huperzine A thirty minutes before bed.\n If you have a high percentage of deep sleep, you will perform better the next day. Be careful about your wine consumption: drinking more than two glasses of wine in the four hours before bedtime can decrease your percentage of deep sleep.\nYou can also find the ideal temperature for your room. On average, you\u2019ll want your room to register somewhere between 19 to 21 degrees Celsius.\nYou can also make great meals based on protein and fat four hours before bed to improve your sleep. Light therapy can also improve the quality of sleep.\nInsulated movements performed before bedtime as well as a cold bath an hour before.\nWe\u2019d Like to invite you to download our free\u00a0\n, for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\nThe 4 Hour Body Quotes\nFinal Notes\n4HB\u2019s plan is incredibly simple and can fix almost every aspect of your life if you dedicate enough to the process.\nThe plan is somewhat restricted and may take some time for you to adjust to it, however, if you commit, you will achieve the results you are looking for.\nThe sheer amount of scientific research used in the different aspects of the plan and the fact that the creator himself made personal experiments puts this plan into a different class when compared to standard diets and exercise plans.\nThe downside of this plan is that either you do everything or nothing. You cannot choose to follow just one part of the diet and expect it to be successful.\nAnother downside is that the plan asks you for too many tests to monitor your progress. These tests cost money and are not available to everyone.\nFinally, this plan was created so that you would only fail if you drop the ball.

And Why?\nIf you are a fan of \n, then be sure to check Haden\u2019s book out for quite a few counterintuitive advices.\nThe most important among them: motivation is not merely the precondition for success; it\u2019s also its result; and it\u2019s not that easy to separate the two as most of the other books do.\nTo quote Dr. Dan Reardon, the co-founder of FitnessGenes, \u201ca must read for all entrepreneurs, company executives, managers, parents, coaches, and wellbeing hackers.\u201d\nAbout Jeff Haden\n is an American journalist, one of the most popular columnists at Inc.com, where he is also a contributing editor.\nEven so, \nis his first book; previously, he has written a few more but only as a ghostwriter.\nFind out more at \n \n\u201cThe Motivation Myth PDF Summary\u201d\nIntroduction: You Can Do\u2014and \n\u2014So Much More Than You Think\nQuick: what do the Philadelphia 76ers and Jeff Haden have in common?\nThe process.\nOf course it\u2019s not funny!\nBut that\u2019s only because you haven\u2019t read \n.\nIf we are forced to summarize it in one word, then \u201cprocess\u201d is definitely the one we\u2019ll choose. As Jeff Haden explains in the \u201cIntroduction,\u201d the difference between successful/happy people and the rest of us is because the former understand both success and happiness as processes, not moments.\nIn other words, it\u2019s not about the finish line and the gold medal \u2013 it\u2019s about the race; or, to use a Joseph Campbell quote, \u201cthe goal of the journey is the journey itself.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you consistently do the right things,\u201d writes Haden, \u201csuccess is predictable. Success is inevitable. You just can\u2019t think about it too much. No obsessing allowed.\u201d\nBut let\u2019s see how this process works in Jeff Haden\u2019s understanding.\nChapter 1: Motivation Is Not the Spark\nHaden begins his book by taking a swipe at \n\u2019 extremely popular book, \n.\nIf you remember well, one of the key moments of that seminar is the \u201chot coals\u201d walk, which Robbins describes as \u201ca symbolic experience that proves if you can make it through the fire, you can make it through anything.\u201d\nIt sure sounds great \u2013 and not only because it reminds us of \n. After all, fire-walking should give you confidence and motivation \u2013 just enough to awake that sleeping giant of potential within you.\nThe problem?\nIt doesn\u2019t work that way.\nSimply put, motivation is never something that can be initiated via a one-off event; and even fire-walking is just that.\nYou need much more than that to get motivated. Fire-walking or a great motivational speech rile you up for a few hours, but you wake up the next day no different than the day before.\nHaden uncovers the deeper problem:\nIn a nutshell, motivation stems from success and fuels more success; consequently, the only thing you need to succeed is just one small victory to get a head start.\nThen \u2013 just follow the loop.\nChapter 2: The Greater Your Focus, the Lower Your Chances of Success\nIf you want to reach a goal, you shouldn\u2019t focus on reaching it.\nYou should set it alright, but one of the worst mistakes you can do is keeping your goal in mind all the time; that\u2019s discouraging.\nAnd it has countereffects: it stimulates you to live much more in your dreamworld than in reality; and you need to do some work in your real life if you want to reach your goals while you\u2019re alive.\nSo, once you set your goal, forget about it! This unleashes the power of feedback, which works sweet as a mediator in the self-reinforcing loop of Success \u2192 Motivation \u2192 More Success \u2192 More Motivation \u2192 More Success\u2026\nHow does this work in practice?\nSay that you want to earn a few more friends; set that goal and now forget about it for it will work against you.\nNext, follow these simple seven steps:\n1. Don\u2019t talk a lot;\n2. Don\u2019t blame;\n3. Don\u2019t try to impress;\n4. Don\u2019t interrupt;\n5. Don\u2019t control;\n6. Don\u2019t preach; and\n7. Don\u2019t dwell on the past.\nThat\u2019s it.\nChapter 3: Your Goal Must Always Choose Your Process\nOnce you know what your goal is, the process chooses itself:\nHow to create a successful process?\nIt\u2019s easy \u2013 all you need to do is just follow these 8 steps:\n1. Set your goal;\n2. Set aside decision anxiety and choose a reasonably promising routine;\n3. If necessary, customize your process to be extremely specific;\n4. Rework your schedule;\n5. Map out your daily plan;\n6. Work the process;\n7. Fix your schedule problems; and\n8. Your results may vary, so adapt accordingly.\nSounds too theoretical?\nHaden offers a sample plan, one which will help you lose ten pounds in thirty days:\n1. Start with a fast day;\n2. Exercise first thing every morning;\n3. Eat four almonds fifteen minutes before every meal;\n4. Drink a glass of water right before every meal;\n5. Always stop eating the moment you start to feel full;\n6. Don\u2019t eat anything white;\n7. Make sure every meal is healthy;\n8. Toss in a snack;\n9. Burn about five hundred extra calories a day;\n10. Cheat wisely;\n11. Keep a food journal;\n12. Check off each step in the process.\nChapter 4: Happiness Comes to Serial Achievers\nIn the fourth chapter of his book, Haden teaches his readers how to choose an appropriate goal and why choosing the right one can transform you into a serial achiever.\nAnd serial achievers are usually happy because happiness \u201crequires evenly balancing your multiple nonnegotiable goals, blending in a negotiable goal where appropriate\u2026 and never, ever forgetting to self-evaluate along the way to ensure the balance never gets out of whack.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why the best goals are usually the ones which solve your current problems; and they all fit well within Maslow\u2019s pyramid.\nIn other words, \u201cif you are in financial straits or relatively poor physical condition, your goal must help you overcome that challenge.\u201d\nEverything else will make you unhappy; you can\u2019t climb Mount Kilimanjaro if your physical condition doesn\u2019t allow you to do that; you need to set another goal before that one: getting back into shape.\nChapter 4.5: Wishing and Hoping Is the Most Unrealistic Approach of All\nMost of the books you\u2019ve read about motivation and accomplishing your goals are \n: just imagine your goal and the whole universe will work in your favor.\nYou don\u2019t need Haden to tell you that this would never work.\nFor the simple reason that, if everyone does that, then how will everybody\u2019s wish come true?\nChapter 5: To Gain Incredible Willpower\u2026 Need Less Willpower\nTime for a few more plans: one which will help you have the most productive day ever, another the most productive week in your life, and a third one the most productive mindset ever.\nAnd a fourth one to explain the title of the chapter.\nThe steps, you ask?\nHere they are!\n1. Let everyone know you won\u2019t be available;\n2. Decide how long you will work;\n3. Totally commit to how long you decided to work;\n4. Start your EPD at an unusual time;\n5. Delay and space out your rewards;\n6. Refuel before you think you need to refuel;\n7. Take productive breaks, not relaxation breaks;\n8. Take your breaks at a counterintuitive moment;\n9. Don\u2019t stop until you\u2019re done\u2014even if finishing takes longer than expected.\n1. Every Sunday, map out your week;\n2. Actively block out task time;\n3. Follow a realistic to-do list;\n4. Default to thirty-minute meetings;\n5. Stop multitasking;\n6. Obsess about leveraging \u2018edge\u2019 time;\n7. Track your time;\n8. Be thoughtful about lunch;\n9. Protect your family time;\n10. Start every day right.\n1. Stop making excuses for doing less;\n2. Stop letting disapproval, or even scorn, stand in your way;\n3. Stop letting fear hold you back;\n4. Stop waiting for inspiration;\n5. Stop turning down the help you need;\n6. Stop stopping.\n1. Eliminate as many choices as possible;\n2. Make decisions tonight so you won\u2019t need to make them tomorrow;\n3. \n;\n4. Refuel often;\n5. Create reminders of your long-term goals;\n6. Remove temptation altogether.\nChapter 5.5: One Question Provides Nearly Every Answer\nIn the second intermezzo of the book, Jeff Haden reminds us of \n and how it is related to his goal: \u201cWill this help Southwest be the lowest-cost provider?\u201d\nSince Kelleher\u2019s plan was to achieve exactly that, then this is the only question which matters.\nUse it yourself, in the modified version that suits the goal you\u2019ve chosen: \u201cWill this help me reach my goal?\u201d\nIf the answer is yes \u2013 then do it; if the answer is no \u2013 then don\u2019t do it.\nChapter 6: Why Work Smarter When You Can Work Your Number?\nWith \n, you can achieve more with less of an effort. \nHaden is not even interested in giving you that option: we learn through trial and error, and you need to be aware whenever you start doing something that there\u2019s always the risk that you\u2019ll fail.\nHowever, the more you fail, the higher the chance that you\u2019ll succeed.\nYou miss 100% of the shots you don\u2019t make, said once Wayne Gretzky.\nWell, that\u2019s one of the greatest lessons you\u2019ll ever learn in your life.\nChapter 7: You Don\u2019t Need a Coach; You Need a Pro\n\u201cWant to get great at something?\u201d asked once Atul Gawande in \n. \u201cGet a coach.\u201d\nDespite the title, Jeff Haden shares much the same opinion. What he doesn\u2019t like \u2013 and doesn\u2019t suggest you to get \u2013 are motivational coaches.\nYou need someone who is experienced in an area and who knows what you are doing; not someone whose only expertise is to brand motivation-practices which work for nobody.\nPick your pro/coach based on your goal; not based on the number of books he/she has sold or the number of people who say they\u2019ve been motivated by him/her.\nAnd once you do choose your pro \u2013 connect with him; sooner or later, you\u2019ll start becoming him.\nChapter 8: Do More by Doing Less\nDoing more doesn\u2019t mean accepting everything that\u2019s on the table; more often than not, it means saying \u201cno;\u201d that\u2019s what\u2019s hidden beneath the somewhat paradoxical title of this chapter.\nDoing more is a process which starts with eliminating everything that you don\u2019t need to do. Whether it\u2019s a permission, report, or sign-off \u2013 one should do it.\nThen \u201cfire\u201d one of your friends: Jim Rohn says that you are the average of the five people you spend most of your time with.\nNext, move on to cutting one expense and dropping one personal commitment.\nAfter you manage to streamline your lunch and do away with a full category of decisions, suddenly you\u2019ll feel a lot freer.\nBecause \u2013 one plus one plus one\u2026 well, you get the point.\nChapter 9: The Bottom Line\nSince this is the conclusion and what \nis all about, we\u2019ll let Haden speak for himself here:\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Motivation Myth\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Motivation Is Not a Spark \u2013 It\u2019s a Result\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Feedback Loop\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Becoming Feels Wonderful Because You\u2019ve Earned It\nMotivation Is Not a Spark \u2013 It\u2019s a Result\nThey\u2019ll tell you that you need to watch motivation videos to inspire yourself; they\u2019ll tell you that it\u2019s a nice idea to do something akin to walking on fire to tap into the potential you naturally have.\nWhat they don\u2019t tell you is that motivation is much more than a one-off event: it\u2019s a result; it\u2019s, even more, a stream of results; and success is a process.\nYou don\u2019t get motivated because you\u2019ve done something or heard something once; the next day you wake up feeling no different.\nYou get motivated because you do something continually.\nAnd you do it well.\nThe Feedback Loop\nBasically, motivation is not merely the prerequisite for success; it\u2019s also its corollary; together, they form a self-reinforcing feedback loop which looks something like this: Success \u2192 Motivation \u2192 More Success \u2192 More Motivation \u2192 More Success\u2026\nThe only thing you need to start?\nA plan.\nAnd a small victory.\n Feels Wonderful Because You\u2019ve Earned It\n\u201cThe one thing I truly loved about being a pro cyclist was the process,\u201d once Lance Armstrong said to Jeff Haden. \u201cNot the accolades, not the money, not the podium\u2026 I miss the process of getting to the point where you can stand on that top step\n\u201d\nAnd then he went on: \u201cI miss the hours spent alone and suffering and working to get to the point where I could win. I loved the process. I loved all the thinking, all the collaborating, all the planning and effort and working with great people. I feel like I got paid to do the races, meet sponsor obligations\u2026 That\u2019s what they paid me for. I would have trained for free.\nI don\u2019t really miss the result. I miss the work.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s the main point of Haden\u2019s book: \n feels wonderful because you\u2019ve earned it.\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Motivation Myth Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\n\u201cJeff Haden knows what many people don\u2019t,\u201d writes Adam Grant, the author of \n, \u201cthat success is less about searching for motivation and more about muddling through until you achieve something motivating.\u201d\nwill undoubtedly help you muddle through.\nIn a witty, engaging and practical manner."},

I enjoyed reading this book very much, and I found it very liberating.\nThe book \u201cQuiet\u201d explains the real power of introverts. How can silence positively affect our way of life? GetNugget\u2019s book summary covers some fundamental aspects of quietness as a tool for happiness and self-satisfaction.\nRaise awareness about the importance of Susan Cain\u2019s book. A Large portion of the population identifies themselves as introverts (according to some unofficial statistics \u2013 it is 1/3 of the population).

To move one step further, you have to understand the difference between \u201copen-minded\u201d and \u201cself-sufficient\u201d people. The first ones, give a lot of importance to speaking, socializing, partying, etc. The other half want to spend a little more time analyzing the world and looking deeply into one\u2019s heart.\nDon\u2019t take introverts as some uncreative freaks; they are capable of inventing as well as taking risks, however, for the majority of times they\u2019d rather keep their ideas for themselves. You must be able to look at both worlds, see the wild part of the extroverted world, and the passion from the introvert one. Combine these two to come up with a \u201cdeadly\u201d combination. This book summary is one-of-a-kind because it reveals the genuine effect of a peaceful mind.\n\u201cQuiet Summary \u201c\nSusan Cain\u00a0is a former Wall Street attorney who made a very bold change, leaving her prosperous job to start a career in\u00a0writing and psychology. She started out\u00a0seeking answers to the common problems of professional life \u2013\u00a0like the fear of public speaking \u2013 but her curiosity about human behavior didn\u2019t stop there. A decade of research later her first book, \n, has finally been published.\nWhat\u2019s going on?\n\u2018s purpose\u00a0is to change the way \n. Research shows that almost half of people are introverts. And yet they tend to get overlooked, overshadowed by the louder extroverts. Cain believes society has a lot to gain from paying attention to the quiet ideas of the introverts.\nCain, herself an introvert, carried out enormous amounts of research in order to give us a better insight into her world. Introversion is an innate personality trait, characterized mostly by preferring to\u00a0spend time alone; a desire\u00a0for deep, meaningful conversation; a\u00a0restricted social life; and a tendency to daydream.\nThe study of human psychology dates back to ancient times, yet in the 21st century, we are still looking for ways to solve the problems facing introverts. According to Cain, these are some of the biggest challenges they face:\nWestern culture tends to promote\u00a0\n as a fulfilled, successful life.\u00a0 Until 9/11 we thought we were unbeatable and our society superior to any other. This was the norm for all types of economic sectors, and everyday life too. Individuals acted on this belief, and then came the great crash of 2008.\nIn \n,\u00a0Susan Cain compares\u00a0Western and Eastern ways of\u00a0thinking, acting, and living. Talking to first- and second-generation Asian immigrants established in the \n., she determined that newcomers to the country are already beating locals in many fields. She believes this is because of the way they approach any scenario, mundane or extraordinary: carefully. Asian schools tend to encourage listening and thinking instead of talking, meaning Asian children grow up with a more sophisticated way of\u00a0dealing with problems. It builds up their perseverance. Cain believes\u00a0Americans see them as unequal competitors, in both academic and professional circles.\nUnfortunately, academic performance is already affecting the professional work environment, too. People who were in school when the book was being written are now employees. Studies show the Millennial generation lacks basic skills such as literacy or, surprisingly \u2013 for a generation described as \u00a0\u2018digital natives\u2019 \u00a0\u2013 computer knowledge.\n is divided into four chapters:\nCain believes that as we can\u2019t help where we are born, the color of our skin, or our personalities, we should accept who we are and make the best of it.\u00a0Science can help us slightly\u00a0by pinpointing our potential personalities from a young age, but without a proper environment to thrive in we may give up\u00a0hope at some point. That is why leaders have a responsibility to represent the interests of everyone they are in charge of. Sometimes introverts end up as leaders; studies prove their work is just as efficient as their extrovert peers, even though their approach may be different.\nCain suggests we must seek \u2013 and find \u2013 solutions to help introverts thrive in a world ruled by extroverts. We must give them the right kind of tasks and the right amount of time they need to finish it. But the introverts must make efforts, too, and adapt their behavior by pushing themselves\u00a0as much as possible.\nShe believes these are the best ways to involve introverts:\nWe may not be able to change the way some things work, and it\u2019s not always possible to put an introvert in a job situation that requires an extrovert. But we can take an example from Eleanor Roosevelt or Rosa Parks \u2013 both introverts who learned to overcome their fears and speak up for what they believed in. Nature shows us that every species has its own role in this mighty ecosystem, and we cannot judge the role that someone else plays in it.\nSince Cain\u2019s book was published in 2012 there have already been big changes made on the issue; the International Day of Introverts celebrated on January 2, is now recognized. The fast-growing digital media offers a vast platform for introverts to make their voice heard too, in their own way.\nAfter all, the most important thing in life is to enjoy it as best we can, so why not give the same opportunity to introverts, too?"},

Those who thrive in creativity and freedom to express themselves. \nBut why even mention that the Right-Side will eclipse or overshadow the Left in years to come? \nLet\u2019s find out.\nWho Should Read \u201cA Whole New Mind\u201d? And Why?\t\nFor argument\u2019s sake, the whole right-left thing has nothing to do with politics! It\u2019s a perspective that entails features and personalized decision-making that best describe the thriving culture. \nThis culture transforms the society and is entwined with the artistic, sophisticated and creative expression of one\u2019s flair.\nIt all boils down to the idea that \u201c\n\u201d will benefit you because it may evoke an emphatic response to this call.\nDo we all have an equal opportunity to excel in this particular realm? \u2013 Let\u2019s see how Daniel Pink defines it. \nAbout Daniel H. Pink \n truly is a linchpin in the realm of behavioral science and business. \nAs the author of \n\u2026 he continues to write in a provocative style.\n\u201cA Whole New Mind PDF Summary\u201d\nNo one can deny the fact that our brains are an incredible blend of neurons, dendrites, and axons. The average one is composed of 100 billion cells, each of which is connected and assigned to transmit special signals. \nThis process basically controls how we act, move, breathe, think, etc.\nThroughout history, people, societies, and physicians regarded the left side as the pivotal one. Let\u2019s puzzle it out a bit. \nAccording to Daniel, two general misinterpretations are floating around that need to be debunked.\nTo address the first, you have to realize that followers of the savior perspective hinge on empirical data and scientific evidence to understand the mechanism. It\u2019s a process that induced a transition \u2013 from legitimacy to reverence. \nAccording to them, the right brain merely reflects the noble and benevolent traits of human conditioning. \nWith regards to the saboteur position, adherents to this perspective attach weight to the idea that the right side is somehow inferior. \nAs a general rule of thumb \u2013 you have to understand that both brains are not under your control. You cannot turn on/off the switch and adjust them based on your beliefs. It\u2019s one driving factor, without any inconsistencies. \nIf you like to dive deeper into technicality then you should know that:\nAll of these elements actually are an integral part of the brain, a mechanism that operates as a whole.\nAn old adage says: \nMany professions such as lawyers, engineers, doctors, are also under scrutiny regarding the functioning of the brain. To label these people, you have to have an aerial perspective of the situation. Peter Drucker came as close as anyone could get and characterized them as \n.\nKnowledge workers are people who unlike the docile workforce which relies on physical readiness and endurance to get a job done, earn a living based on the skills learned at school. \nWell, their prowess most definitely is harder to acquire, because it\u2019s predicated on analytical and theoretical thinking. \u00a0\nIn the age of abundance, if you are endowed with valuable knowledge, it\u2019s much easier to distinguish yourself from the herd. Logic, rationality, and functionality would be your main tools to get the ball rolling. However, if their work is not appealing to the eye, few people will be interested in it. \nJust a couple of words more for you to understand the nature of \u201cplenty.\u201d\nPeople\u2019s lives have changed so much in the past century, and in the aftermath of this alteration, the focus has shifted from short-term thinking into the broader context. \nGenerating wealth has remained one of the key elements in our everyday lives, but not the only one. \nIt\u2019s totally accurate to imply that the number of people trapped into poverty declines consistently over the years. On top of that, abundance as a way of looking at things has helped the less-developed societies to get access to goods and services previously unavailable to them. \nOne of them is electricity.\nOn this quest, Daniel met with a group of people from India who exhibited an enormous amount of talent in computer science, aerospace engineering; you name it. \nIn the US, a typical chip designer makes around $7,000 a month, while in India or Russia you can get the same quality and pay no more than $1,000. Thus, knowledge workers are rapidly changing the workforce and add to globalization. \nOutsourcing is becoming an integral part of the modern-day organization, and you should not underestimate the long-term impact of it. \nNext up, Daniel Pink addresses the whole revolution regarding market changes; from the industrial age to the digital era saturated with opportunities!\nSo, what does this have anything to do with the brain? Insofar as our brains are concerned, societies have built their cultures and cities on the backs of workers (people\u2019s left brains). Nowadays, the emphasis falls on the right side, which embodies more artistic expression and freedom. \nIn the conceptual age or the age of abundance, a lot of people ponder the matter of outsourcing the work and transferring the financial burden to lower-wage countries. \nOn top of that, students in medical schools are taught to go beyond computer diagnosis and pay attention to the patient\u2019s story. You can interpret it in countless different ways, but that is the consequence of the high-touch & high-concept process that is permeating the Western system. \nThe answer lies in the six-sense rule contrived by Daniel that guides the R-Directed aptitudes.\n#1 Design\nIt goes without saying that creating, launching and designing a product is no longer enough. Nowadays, we must strive towards excellence because the markets have shifted from mass oriented to user-centric and exclusive. \nThe economic and social struggle has penetrated deep into the behavioral patterns, causing a massive shift in demand. Companies and organizations, in general, must do their best in making their products or services emotionally engaging and pragmatic. \n#2 Story\nIn a world saturated with information and data, one must try hard not to delude itself. The story you tell and the picture you portray will make a valid argument, or spark a debate that will help you evaluate your ideas.\nSomewhere along the line, you\u2019ll be reprimanded or even chastised for making a point.\nNonetheless, you must stay firm in what you believe to be true, and stick to it. Also, you have to advocate for freedom of expression by allowing productive intercourse to take place. \n#3 Symphony\nIt\u2019s needless to say that the age of abundance requires specialization, above all else. \nWhat does that mean?\nMuch of the white-collar work is currently under transition and is steered toward Asia. The rest of it falls under software and depicts the symphony of skills. \nYou may be misled into believing that analysis or data-tracking are in highest demand, when actually seeing the big picture, and pushing beyond traditional norms is on a higher scale. \n#4 Empathy\nTruthfully, the ability to think, contemplate, figure out solutions is what makes us unique. \nIt\u2019s also totally inaccurate to lean on logic, as the only tool at our disposal. In a world filled with contrasts, being analytical isn\u2019t the only solution. \nTo thrive in today\u2019s world, you have to put up with many new concepts not tilted toward the extremes. Surely, empathy and the aptitude for forging relationships can be counted among those concepts. \n#5 Play\nWell, yeah, we all need to go crazy sometimes and lift the spirits of everyone around us. Games, laughter, playfulness are all necessary elements that could improve the quality of life in general. \nThe lightheartedness illustrated here serves a great purpose. \nBy no means should your seriousness be met with rebuffs, because there are times when being cold sober counts. Daniel reckons that conflating the idea of playfulness with the conceptual knowledge is probably the best approach.\n#6 Meaning\nEven third-world countries are starting to reap the benefits of the abundance age.\nLiving in a material plenty world has taken a toll on societal norms, but has freed millions of people from the everyday struggle for a piece of bread and roof above our heads. \nIn other words, we have the power to pursue subtler desires, goals, and spiritual maturity. \nThe future of jobs and societal structure will depend on the following three questions. \nKey Lessons from \u201cA Whole New Mind\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Right-side keeps winning\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transition is not bad\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keep your chin up\nThe Right-side keeps winning\nBy now, you probably understand the necessity of mastering the R-Directed aptitudes and their absolute domination in the age of abundance. \nThe right side of the brain offers a genuine response to the powerful and emotional urge of the society. It\u2019s a legitimate indicator that shows why the L-Direction is falling behind.\nTransition is not bad\nWell, we cannot force you to embrace change, but it is something you should do. The strange thing is even if you\u2019ve been dragged into accepting only the left side (unconsciously), the transition will automatically take place. \nThe whole world is actually experiencing this change, without any visible instigators to back it up.\nKeep your chin up\nWell, not all people will easily fit into the Right-Brain category.

And Why?\nIf you want to become the leader of the future, then Richard Branson is undoubtedly one of your idols; he is just too colorful and vibrant to \n be.\nUnsurprisingly, most of his books share this description; true, none of them is as exceptional and interesting as his first one, his autobiography \nnot even its sequel, \nBut \nis as close as it gets to being that good.\nSo, it\u2019s almost a must.\nAbout Richard Branson\n is a British entrepreneur, one of the wealthiest people in the world (worth over $5 billion) and certainly the most colorful and unusual among them.\nA high-school dropout, Branson set up a mail-order record business in his teenage years. In 1972, he teamed up with Nik Powell to open a record store, dubbed \u201cVirgin Records,\u201d because he was new at business.\nThe brand grew rapidly during the next few decades, and currently controls over 400 companies in many different spheres.\nIn 2000, Branson was knighted for his services to entrepreneurship; two years later, he was voted the 85th Greatest Briton in history and in 2007, one of \n\u2019s Most Influential People in the World.\nFind out more at \n.\n\u201cThe Virgin Way PDF Summary\u201d\nPublished in 2014, \n seems to have more subtitles than the Virgin Group has companies: \u201cEverything I Know About Leadership,\u201d \u201cIf It\u2019s Not Fun, It\u2019s Not Worth Doing,\u201d \u201cHow to Listen, Learn, Laugh, and Lead\u201d\u2026\nWe chose the last one because that\u2019s how the book is organized inside: four parts, each containing about five chapters, framed between a preface and an epilogue.\nHowever, the other two subtitles should do as well.\nIn fact, most of the preface Branson dedicates to uncovering \u201cthe worst kept secret in entrepreneurship,\u201d aka the second of the three subtitles listed above.\nAs you know full well, Branson left school when he was sixteen to found his own magazine-publishing company.\nThe reason why he did this is that the latter was his dream, and the former seemed an obstacle to it.\nHowever, to his surprise, many people follow conventions rather than dreams and always hope that their lives will miraculously change in the future.\nThe simple point is: if you want to do something, then do it; and don\u2019t look for excuses in the way society is organized or other people; your dreams are your own responsibility.\nAchieving them is a four-step process, best summed up in four L-imperatives: listen, learn, laugh, and lead.\nLet\u2019s have a look at them. \nPart One \u2013 Listen\n\u201cI believe,\u201d writes Richard Branson, \u201cthat listening is one of the most important skills for any teacher, parent, leader, entrepreneur or, well, just about anyone who has a pulse.\u201d\nBranson acquired this skill through the good parenting practice of his mother, who, ever since his earliest days, urged him to interact with people, and banned him from spending too many hours in front of the TV.\nThis influenced the young Richard to the point that he started carrying with himself a small notebook in which he regularly took notes; sometimes clever sayings, sometimes things said at a meeting or during a casual conversation.\nIt may have seemed a bit strange at first, but, soon enough, people grew accustomed to the notetaking Branson.\nListening, as far as Branson is concerned, is where it all starts: every great leader was a great listener beforehand.\nAfter all, none of us is smart enough to know everything and many of us have come to some understandings or developed ideas which should be taken note of.\nAnd that\u2019s why listening is so essential.\nIt\u2019s much different from hearing, which is what you do when you are annoyed by a baby crying on an airplane; you\u2019re merely registering the information and doing nothing with it; however, listening is something else: it\u2019s understanding what that info stands for and what \nshould do with it.\nIn addition, listening is not sitting quietly for 20/30 minutes in front of the person you\u2019re talking to; that may be a good start sometimes, but unless you\u2019re actually absorbing the information, contrary to what other people say, you\u2019re not a great conversationalist, but a great would-be psychiatrist.\nThe point is to speak \n people, not speak \n them.\nAnd that\u2019s the first lesson Branson wants to share with you.\nPart Two \u2013 Learn\nListening is the foundation of learning.\nAccording to Richard Branson, everyone can be a leader; and, in a way, almost everyone is \u2013 in his or her own orbit. Someone is a leader of his family, other of his football team, and yet a third one of his office.\nBut, as we have told you numerous times, great leaders \u2013 \n \u2013 are usually the ones who can be something more than that.\nHow has Branson achieved it?\nWell, first of all \u2013 and paradoxically \u2013 by learning that the more exceptional he is, the less exceptional he needs to be.\nLeaders who don\u2019t want to dine with their subordinates are not leaders \u2013 but feudal rulers with antiquated beliefs which will result in their ruin; in fact, as Simon Sinek says, real \n.\nThis is basically how the Virgin companies function \u2013 Branson doesn\u2019t want to present himself as someone precious who is not interested in his employees, but the other way around.\nAnd he does this by always finding new territories for his companies to conquer. That\u2019s, in his opinion, the most important job of any leader: to venture forward into the unknown.\nStanding still, in the dynamic age of today, is basically the same as writing your own death\u2019s verdict.\nCase in point: Kodak.\nIn the 1970s, Kodak was an industry giant and the first company of its kind to discover the digital camera. However, its executives didn\u2019t want to embrace this new inventing, fearing that it would mean the end of their business model.\nSo, instead of further investing in developing digital cameras, Kodak spent large sums of cash into pointing out the flaws of digital cameras.\nOther companies used this mistake, and they corrected them.\nKodak filed for bankruptcy in 2012.\nPart Three \u2013 Laugh\nLet us guess:\nThe first that that comes to your mind in the early hours of the last day of the workweek is a \u201cthank god it\u2019s Friday!\u201d And, just like Brenda Ann Spencer, you too don\u2019t like Mondays (OK, not \nmuch).\nYou know what the underlying message of it all is?\nYou don\u2019t like your job, aka you are on a path of spending a third of your life doing something you don\u2019t want to.\nRichard Branson didn\u2019t want to do this \u2013 and was willing to pay any price not to repeat the mistake of the majority of the population.\nSo, he decided to do something he is passionate about and wants to work with people who share this passion.\nYou know, people who, instead of being grumpy, are actually laughing and enjoying the office parties because they like where they work.\n\u201cI believe that hard-wired passion,\u201d writes Branson, \u201cfor giving customers\u2026 a better work environment or service experience that they can\u2019t find elsewhere is at the very heart of what the Virgin brand and I stand for.\u201d\nThis is why Branson is always involved in the process of hiring, which he thinks is the one thing you should never delegate.\nEven if you are Google and you\u2019re hiring about 4,000 people a year; case in point: Larry Page still insists on having the final word whether someone is fit for his company or not.\nRichard Branson is no exception:\nThe bottom line: CVs don\u2019t matter; people do. \nPart Four \u2013 Lead\n\u201cWhen I started out with what was to become Virgin more than four decades ago,\u201d writes Branson, \u201cI genuinely wanted \u2013 and still do want to \u2013 change people\u2019s lives for the better.\u201d\nThe Leaders of the Future, according to Branson, are the ones who share this belief of his. You can\u2019t be a good leader if you are only in it for the money; but you can be a great one if your goal is to make a difference, to make the world a more beautiful place for the future generations.\nSpeaking of \u2013 Branson firmly believes in collaboration as a way of achieving this. \nGone are the times, according to him, when collaboration was deemed detrimental to the successes of an entrepreneur at the market.\nNow, it\u2019s the other way around: collaboration is the only key for success.\nIn fact, Richard Branson reiterates a point many people have made several times during the past few decades (think Isaacson\u2019s \nor Matt Ridley\u2019s \n): nobody has ever operated alone; and great innovators and entrepreneurs are just the last in a long line of collaborators across time.\nThe future belongs to those who collaborate across space.\nKey Lessons from \u201cThe Virgin Way\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou Are Guaranteed to Miss Every Shot You Don\u2019t Take\u201d\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLuck Is What Happens When Preparation Meets Opportunity\u201d\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGreat Leaders Are Almost Always Great Simplifiers\u201d\n\u201cYou Are Guaranteed to Miss Every Shot You Don\u2019t Take\u201d\nRichard Branson indicates several times throughout his book that he owes a lot of his success to the parenting methods of his father and mother.\nFor example, one time, his mum asked his dad to spank him on the backside for not adhering to her orders in Sunday church. His father took to the other room and clapped his hands together to simulate beating.\nBranson thinks that he learned an even better lesson when, one day, after an abysmal performance in a cricket match, he returned home depressed and ashamed of his abilities.\n\u201cRicky,\u201d his mother said, \u201ceven though we both know that this wasn\u2019t your best performance, you should never forget that you are guaranteed to miss every shot you don\u2019t take.\u201d\nLife is an experiment. \nTry everything once. Except incest and folk dancing.\n(Even though you can find it in \n, that funny quote is not by Richard Branson, but by Sir Thomas Beecham, the famous conductor).\n\u201cLuck Is What Happens When Preparation Meets Opportunity\u201d\nMike Oldfield\u2019s \nwas the very first release of Virgin Records, founded in 1972 after Branson realized that he was earning enough money from his record store to realize a childhood dream.\nEven though the album was a chart-topping bestseller in the United Kingdom, Richard Branson had problems selling it overseas.\nAhmet Ertegun, the co-founder, and president of Atlantic Records didn\u2019t believe that an all-instrument album would be any kind of success in the United States.\nHowever, he agreed to see what all the fuss was about.\nThe very day he played the record, William Friedkin, who was filming \nat the time, entered his office.\nThe rest, as they say, is history \u2013 \n.\nThe moral of the story is in the title of this section. \nThe Romans had an even more pithy saying: \u201cfortune favors the bold.\u201d \nTry \u2013 and eventually, you\u2019ll get lucky.\n\u201cGreat Leaders Are Almost Always Great Simplifiers\u201d\nAs inferred by Richard Branson, companies evolve in much the same manner as people, and leaders should act accordingly.\nStartups are all about trying to find your feet \u2013 as you know full well, half of the companies don\u2019t even survive this period; so that\u2019s your only goal at the beginning.\nThe ones who do are like teenagers: they think they know it all and are full of vigor and energy, investing 24 hours a day into something much bigger than anyone can understand; of course, the teenage years come with many mistakes; the point is not to make a fatal one.\nBecause, if none of the mistakes in a company\u2019s teenage stage is fatal, then the mature stage arrives when as a leader you should be smart enough to correct all of your mistakes.\nEven though everything is quiet and well at this point, the mid-life crisis is lurking around the corner and many leaders, at this stage, spend most of their time looking in their rear-view mirrors.\nDon\u2019t do that.\nWhenever you can, find the time to listen, learn, and laugh \u2013 and you\u2019ll be able to lead better than most!\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cThe Virgin Way Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\nDescribed as \u201ca book on leadership from someone who has never read a book on leadership in his life,\u201d \ndoesn\u2019t contain everything Branson knows about leadership and is a bit of a letdown.\nNot because it\u2019s a bad one, but because its author is Richard Branson.\nParadoxically, that may be the main reason why you should read it."},

And Why?\nIf you are interested in psychology, \nis a necessary read; especially if you are a beginner, and you want to understand the essence of Jung\u2019s ideas.\nWritten for the general public, it covers all of the basics and serves as a great introduction to the work of one of the most important intellectuals of the 20\n century.\nAbout Carl G. Jung\n was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, founder of the school of analytical psychology, and one of the most influential intellectuals of the past century.\nWhile working as a research scientist under Eugen Bleuler at the Burgh\u00f6lzli in Zurich, Jung attracted the attention of Sigmund Freud who thought of him as his heir; the Austrian even named Jung the first head of the International Psychoanalytic Association, founded by none other than Freud in 1910.\nHowever, Jung\u2019s research led him away from Freud, and two had a not so amicable rift which deeply scarred Carl Jung and influenced his further thought and beliefs.\nCreator of some of the most important concepts in psychology \u2013 individuation, archetypes, the collective unconscious, introversion/extraversion, synchronicity \u2013 Jung\u2019s work has influenced many different areas of human knowledge, ranging from psychiatry and philosophy to anthropology and literature.\n\u201cMan and His Symbols PDF Summary\u201d\nIntroduction\n\u201cThe origins of this book are sufficiently unusual to be of interest,\u201d writes John Freeman in the \u201cIntroduction\u201d to \n,\n\u201cand they bear a direct relation to its contents and what it sets out to do. So, let me tell you just how it came to be written.\u201d\nWho is John Freeman, you ask, and how does he know about the origins of Jung\u2019s last book?\nWell, you can say that he is directly responsible for its existence.\nHe was a journalist \u2013 also a decorated soldier, a diplomat, and a politician \u2013 who worked for the BBC during the middle years of the past century; during this period he was mainly known as the presenter and the interviewer for BBC\u2019s excellent show, \nIn 1959, he got to interview Carl Gustav Jung \u2013 then in the ninth decade of his life \u2013 at the psychiatrist\u2019s home in Zurich. \nFreeman was pretty affected by Jung\u2019s views and overwhelmed by his amicable persona; he left Zurich lamenting the fact that Jung\u2019s theories were seen as being inferior to Sigmund Freud\u2019s at the time.\nAs far as Freeman was concerned, this was not because the latter were more correct, but because Jung\u2019s were not available in a form which should communicate them to the general public.\nSo, he tried convincing Jung that he should write such a book; however, Jung was reluctant and firmly denied the need for such an endeavor. \nAnd then \u2013 as you would only expect from a man famous for researching the unconscious \u2013 Jung had a dream which convinced him in the opposite.\nBy this time, however, he was already pretty sick, so \nis authored by both him and a few of his closest collaborators.\nAnd it\u2019s everything Freeman hoped it would be.\nPart 1: \u201cApproaching the Unconscious\u201d by Carl G. Jung\nThe first chapter of \nwas written entirely by Jung, and originally in English, one of the very few things Jung ever wrote in the language.\nJung starts his essay by making a distinction between signs and symbols. \nSigns merely denote the objects to which they are attached; trademarks and names of patent medicines are good examples of them. \nSymbols, however, are much more complex, vague and unknown; they are terms, names, or pictures which, even though sometimes familiar from daily life, possess \u201cspecific connotations in addition to its conventional and obvious meaning.\u201d\nDreams communicate with us in terms of symbols.\nWhy?\nFor the same reason that a stenographer uses shorthand to encode data in a form which can subsequently be decoded; namely, there\u2019s just too much of it all around us, and our unconscious uses shorthand as well.\nHowever, the shorthand of symbols written by our dreams is not exactly easy to understand; \n, but according to Jung he made a few big mistakes.\nThe biggest one?\nIgnoring something Jung calls the collective unconscious.\nJung agrees with Freud that all of us contain two personalities within ourselves; every ancient civilization knew this, referring to the deeper part of us with the word \u201csoul;\u201d today, we call it \u201cpsyche\u201d which is basically the same, since \u201cpsyche\u201d means \u201csoul\u201d in Greek.\nHowever, Jung goes a step further than Freud.\nYes, he says, we contain two personalities within ourselves, but the unconscious part of us is divided into two as well. \nFreud\u2019s unconscious is Jung\u2019s personal unconscious; and Jung\u2019s collective unconscious is a new term introduced by Jung himself referring to a vessel of images and symbols shared by all human beings.\nAs opposed to Freud\u2019s, Jung\u2019s psychotherapeutic practice (called Analytical Psychology) usually revolves around a patient\u2019s relationship to the collective unconscious.\nAs far as Jung is concerned, the problems he is interested in are, more or less, Western problems. \nIn other words, most of the other civilizations \u2013 especially the Eastern ones \u2013 are not as dissociated from their souls (their psyches, their unconscious beings) as are we, the modern Europeans and Americans.\nWhy?\nBecause, ever since the Renaissance, we\u2019ve put too much emphasis on our rational selves, and, as a consequence, ignored the irrational.\nSince it is not something that can be ignored, our unconscious has come back to haunt us.\nLiterally.\nIt bursts into our dreams and forms the shadows that lurk behind us, reminding us constantly of the things we\u2019ve never achieved or the things we want to.\nThe Western unconscious is darker simply put because, by ignoring it, we\u2019ve disintegrated our very own selves and created a deep chasm in which the meaninglessness of our lives lies buried.\nIf you want to find some meaning and purpose, then your job is to find, once again, coherence, by first understanding the messages your unconscious sends you through your dreams and then use them as your guiding light.\nJung writes:\nPart 2: \u201cAncient Myth and Modern Man\u201d by Joseph L. Henderson\nJoseph L. Henderson begins his essay by commending Carl Gustav Jung\u2019s life-work.\nAccording to him, it is Jung who taught us to not only rediscover our ancient symbolic history but also to think of it in terms of ever-important ever-presence. \nUnlike many other thinkers and philosophers before him who saw in the ancient rituals and images merely primitive beliefs, Jung was right to see something which is buried so deep within the human\u2019s psyche that it always speaks to us in a deep and meaningful manner.\nFor example, we still celebrate Easter, Christmas, Halloween and many other holidays in a way which is profoundly riddled with symbolism; it is a sad affair that we have forgotten to understand its meaning, since, as Jung has discovered, it is still relevant to us.\nWhy?\nBecause, more or less, these images are as real and as vital to us as, say, our hearts and brains; these images are actually organic.\nJung calls them archetypes, and defines them as tendencies to form some representations of a single motif, \u201crepresentations that can vary a great deal in detail without losing their basic pattern.\u201d\n\u201cThere are,\u201d Jung writes in the first part, \u201cmany representations of the motif of the hostile brethren, but the motif itself remains the same.\u201d\nThese archetypes are usually dismissed as merely \u201cinherited representations,\u201d but Jung says that it is absurd to link them exclusively to our conscious selves.\nIf it was so, then they wouldn\u2019t be so bewildering, and we would have easily understood them.\nThe truth is, he says, that they are collectively-inherited unconscious ideas and patterns which are universally present in individual psyches.\nIn continuation, Henderson analyzes Jung\u2019s four major archetypes (animus/anime, the self, the shadow, the persona) and four others: \n, the Trickster, Initiation, and Transcendence.\nPart 3: \u201cThe Process of Individuation\u201d by M.-L. von Franz\nMarie-Louise von Franz\u2019s essay \u201cThe Process of Individuation\u201d deals more closely with the four major Jungian archetypes and with the different manners in which their interaction contributes to our development.\nIndividuation, if successful, is precisely that: the process of integration of the innate elements of our personalities (these archetypes) into a well-functioning whole.\nIt is an innate need for self-realization that leads us to explore and, subsequently, integrate these disowned parts; a failure to do so will result in neuroticism, manifested through psychosis, phobias, or depression.\nAll of these, if we are to believe Jung, are the result of us not being interested enough to get to know with our deeper selves.\nOur inner core is the Self \u2013 and not the Ego; the Ego is merely the bridge between our unconscious and the real world; it makes real what the psyche imagines; so, in a nutshell, it is nothing more than the outer side of our psyche.\nThe Self always has some kind of a purpose; and our Ego, during our lives, has to recognize this purpose and works toward its realization.\nThink of this purpose as destiny: as far as Jungians are concerned, you are preprogrammed to become something; self-realization is actually like solving a puzzle: you need to interpret your purpose correctly, and then walk the path toward making it a reality.\nJust like knight must face dragons to save the damsel in distress and unite with her, you need to recognize your Shadow (the shameful behavior your Ego wants to stifle) and integrate with the contra-sexual aspect of your personality (Anima/Animus).\nOnly then your Ego will deflate and make room for your purpose; however, individuation is not narcissism, but the opposite of it.\nIt\u2019s becoming who you genuinely and \n are by accepting \n else.\nPart 4: \u201cSymbolism in the Visual Arts\u201d by Aniela Jaff\u00e9\nMost of the points made by Von Franz in the third part of \nare repeated by Aniela Jaff\u00e9 in the fourth, this time via an analysis of the history of the visual arts.\nJaff\u00e9 mentions from the start that, in a way, humans are different from the other species mainly because of their capacity to shape symbols \u2013 \n. \nThree symbolic motifs which Jaff\u00e9 considers central are subsequently analyzed through this essay: the motifs of the stone, the animal, and the circle.\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that, in the beginning, it wasn\u2019t the Word, but the Stone; millennia ago, humans somehow devised the notion that stones may have some more profound meaning if carved or arraigned; so, they started doing exactly that; because of this, stones may have been the earliest visual representations, the most ancient human symbols.\nSoon afterward, humans moved on to drawing and redrawing another important symbolic motif: the animals; in fact, almost all of the cave paintings you know are animal representations.\nWhy?\nBecause of the Shadow we talked about above; the animal motif is symbolic of human\u2019s instinctual nature. In other words, early humans realized \u2013 of course, not consciously \u2013 that they are divided, and that one part of them is still nothing more but a wild animal.\nThey knew full well that the only way for a society to exist is if everyone tamed his/her own animal; so, in a way, they talked about psychic individuation and integration through images.\nThe circle is the final motif that Jaff\u00e9 explores, noting that it is almost universally recognized as a symbol of completeness and wholeness. \nJung himself thought of the Circle as a representation of the Self-archetype; when it is combined with a Circle (usually the latter is within the former), Analytic Psychologists tend to think of these images as visual representations of our duality \u2013 the circle representing our psyche and the square our body.\nEver wondered why modern Western Art is neither realistic nor comprehensible?\nWell, according to Jaff\u00e9 \u2013 and Jung, and many other mythologists and anthropologists \u2013 it is because of how much Western societies have put an emphasis on our rational beings and because of how much they have ignored the unconscious.\nThe more they did this, the more modern art came to reflect the obscure, the ambiguous and the hard-to-decipher unconscious as a counterbalance.\nIn a way, art is not realistic because we are \n realistic.\nPart 5: \u201cSymbols in an Individual Analysis\u201d by Jolande Jacobi\n\u201cOther contributors to this book,\u201d writes Jolande Jacobi in the fifth part of \n,\nhave described the nature of [dream] symbols and the role they play in man\u2019s psychological nature. I wish to show how analysis can aid the individuation process by taking the example of a young engineer, aged 25, whom I shall call Henry.\u201d\nAnd so she does, outlining her attempt to understand the psyche of this young man whose dreams include walls and railings, monks, and visiting a brother as a soldier.\nThrough careful analysis, Jacobi shows how these dream images uncover a tender introverted soul trapped within a \u201cmother-prison,\u201d simultaneously afraid and willing to tread the path toward independence and self-realization.\nWhy have these dream images appeared now and not before?\nWell, simply put, because previously he never had a job, and his first job was the breaking point because it faced him with a choice: to either leave his home and realize himself or stay trapped forever in his introverted nature.\nFortunately, through the course of several meetings with Jacobi \u2013 spanning many months \u2013 Henry successfully overcomes his anxieties and fears and is eventually able to leave his home and even marry.\nConclusion: \u201cScience and the Unconscious\u201d by M.-L. von Franz\nThe conclusion of the book is once again written by M.-L. von Franz.\nIn it, she tries to outline the scientific foundations for Jung\u2019s theory of the unconscious, making a few quasi-scientific claims but also making an excellent point that our current state of affairs in the exact sciences must change profoundly if we are interested in finding out more about our very own beings.\nUnfortunately, half a century later, not much has changed.\nKey Lessons from \u201cMan and His Symbols\u201d\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You Are Someone You Don\u2019t Know\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Embrace Your Shadow and Your Anima/Animus\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Western Civilization Has a Serious Problem\nYou Are Someone You Don\u2019t Know\nWhat Freud and Jung discovered was that something previous generations had taken for granted \u2013 namely, our integrity \u2013 is not only far from the truth, but is also the reason why we\u2019re unhappy.\nNamely, in addition to our conscious and rational part \u2013 the one we communicate with and understand well \u2013 there is also an unconscious aspect of our being which talks with us through the symbols of our dreams and stories.\nThese symbols are shared between all humans (they are part of the collective unconscious) and are individualized in the mind of every single human being.\nEmbrace Your Shadow and Your Anima/Animus\nIn stories, knights kill dragons and save the damsels in distress; in films, charismatic bandits stop trains and save the girl tied to it by the villain.\nEven though it is a different story, the underlying motif is the same, and it is the program which guides us to our self-realization.\nThe thing that inspires us to be heroes is our Self; the dragon or the train is our Shadow, the repository of all dark and traumatic events our Ego buries far from our sight; and the lady is the Anima (or Animus if you are a woman), the counter-sexual part of our being.\nContrary to many intellectuals before him, Jung thinks that, instead of ignoring them, we should embrace our Shadow and our Anima, because that\u2019s the only way we can grow to become self-realized beings.\nOtherwise, we\u2019ll suffer from neurotic conditions.\nWestern Civilization Has a Serious Problem\nWestern men are, in general, much more prone to suffering from anxieties and depression.\nThe reason?\nThe division between their unconscious and conscious selves is much greater than the division in Eastern societies.\nAnd why is that?\nWell, because, since half a millennium ago, we put all our chips on our rational selves and started ignoring everything else.\nAnd the unconscious has come back to haunt us, as can be readily observed in our modern art, which is much more symbolic and less realistic than any other in history.\nIt\u2019s the Unconscious \u2013 striking back!\nWe\u2019d like to invite you to download our free \n for more amazing summaries and audiobooks.\n\u201cMan and His Symbols Quotes\u201d\nOur Critical Review\n\u201cThis book,\u201d says a \n review \u201cprovides a unique opportunity to assess his contribution to the life and thought of our time, for it was also [Jung\u2019s] first attempt to present his life-work in psychology to a non-technical public.\u201d\nAnd it goes on: \u201cWhat emerges with great clarity from the book is that Jung has done immense service both to psychology as a science and to our general understanding of man in society, by insisting that imaginative life must be taken seriously in its own right, as the most distinctive characteristic of human beings.\u201dAnd we have nothing to add, save a few words we wrote when we included \nin our list of \n: \u201cDensely illustrated and beautifully written, the book is the best introduction to Jungian psychology, and one of the most influential psychological books ever published.\u201d\n\n"}
